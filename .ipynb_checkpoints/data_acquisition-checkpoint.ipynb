At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins, senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. Thank you. You may begin.Nicole Shevins -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 ended March 31, 2024. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's chairman and chief executive officer; Karl Slatoff, our president; and Lainie Goldstein, our chief financial officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss. Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory; and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series. During fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high-quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market. Now, turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the No. 1 basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To date, the title has sold-in over 9 million units. Engagement remains high, with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continued to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences, including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go; NBA 2K Mobile; and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top 5 on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday-themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast. And to date, the title has sold-in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23%, respectively, for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms, according to Streamhatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar's premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts, and we're thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K's renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We've already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox's catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We're also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film, which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest-rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional, with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches. In addition, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series' history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the fall. I'd like to thank our friends Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I'd like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our company. Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a top 20 grossing game in the U.S. Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play Store. We're pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily playtime to around 60 minutes per user. Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons' Treasure competition and many other features. We'd like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth. Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming top 100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I'm highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry-leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet, and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency. And as we deliver our groundbreaking pipeline over the next several years, we're poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.Karl Slatoff -- President Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future, which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline, which includes approximately 40 titles through fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost reduction program, through which we canceled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success. These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to fiscal 2025. We have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA, and, WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live. Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26th. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC. This new ARPG was well-received for its visceral combat, distinct art style, and rich narrative. Private Division, along with Weta Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones: Legends. NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this nonsimulation tactical card battle, players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We're proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for this year. As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including 15 immersive core releases: six of which are sports simulation games; one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and are entering fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult, will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction. We are confident that, over time, these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results. We delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series; and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K2, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+. NBA 2K was in line with the prior year, and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concepts' ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year over year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $42 million, as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million, due to higher external developer advances, cash tax, and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost reduction programs. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year over year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses. We recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year over year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Looking ahead and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to fall of calendar 2025 from calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025 as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever, and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. Now, moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC, and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid-single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year over year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program. In closing, we believe that we are very well-positioned to deliver the highest quality content in our industry and to enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We are extremely excited about our path to the future, and we look forward to sharing more details about the many catalysts ahead for our company. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication to our business and for creating the highest quality, most engaging entertainment franchises that captivate our global audiences. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Gearbox acquisition. In the past, you've expressed that you never really felt the need to own all of Gearbox. Here you are about to own all of Gearbox. Can you talk about how you think about now owning all of Gearbox and some of the opportunities that you'll have with that?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is, when asked when Gearbox was sold to Embracer, whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. You know, we have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he's a hitmaker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and Tiny Tina was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So, we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst OK. And then, Lainie, with regards to the annual cost savings that you announced, how much of that should be seen in fiscal '25?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, we'll start to see it in fiscal '25, but we'll see a full annualization of it in fiscal year '26. So, the majority of the plan was executed in Q4 and Q1, but it's -- pieces of it will come through this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey. Thank you. The ability of Rollic to launch top 100 grossing games is a really pleasant surprise. Just wondering if you could talk about how to think about the life cycle of those games. You know, typically, Rollic's games are sort of -- you know, they're hot for a while, and then they move on to something next -- something else. Is this going to be the case for these monetizing games as well or is it -- it planned to have a longer life cycle? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid-casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hyper-casual approach really was, you know, put it out there, get a bunch of downloads, offer a rather light experience, you know, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted. But, you know, long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content, and Rollic is proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long-lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic. I believe we can. We haven't done so yet, but we're off to a really good start.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a couple for me. I guess, first off, on the change to the guidance and the outlook, what is your level of confidence, Strauss, in that calendar '25 launch of GTA VI, and is there any -- anything else more specific you can talk about what's behind that postponement? And then secondly, on the high single-digit mobile growth, I'm curious how much of that is related to any recovery you're seeing broadly in mobile gaming, or is that more specific to the increase in marketing spend and these titles that are outperforming your expectations for this year? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Colin. Well, we actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga, because we are the market leader, of course, it's driven by the market in which we live. And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year, we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot in UA in the fourth quarter. We did, and that's turned out to be productive spending.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Coss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess between the success you've had with Match Factory and some new launch titles, setting a release date for Star Wars Hunters, and then the incremental marketing behind mobile, it seems like there's definitely more momentum in that business, which is great to see. I guess, when we think about your analytical framework for investing in the marketing behind mobile, what are you targeting from a margin or payback perspective and when should we expect to see this investment turn into profitable flow-through from the mobile side?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, I hope, like everyone else, we look at these very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition; what kind of retention you expect, which is to say what kind of churn you get; the spending that you have on average; and therefore, the lifetime value. And the longer a payback period you're willing to accept, of course, the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data, and they can change at any given time. So, I'm not prepared to share sort of, you know, our outside payback period. Suffice it to say, though, that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you. And when would you expect to see, you know, mobile -- this investment that you're making in mobile flip from a cost center to, you know, driving incremental profit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking, though, which is, frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I declined to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods. We do, however, tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst It does. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, could you address your forecast for NBA 2K RCS in fiscal '25 for a slight increase? Is low single-digits growth the new normal for this going forward, or is there something unique in fiscal '25 that's influencing that view? Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we absolutely expect growth in NBA, and that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full-game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9, and Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we're going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard. And when you look at the recurrent consumer spending, specifically -- when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the charts, it's fantastic. So, we've seen significant growth there. So, again, I think we will have momentum. Just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we're going to continue to see very strong RCS growth.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the change in bookings this year versus what you guys were talking about last quarter, how much comes from moving GTA versus any other shifts versus the restructuring. And then -- yeah, I guess I'll stop there. Thanks.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, for fiscal year '25, the outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window from the calendar 2025 to fall, as we mentioned. There were also some other movements within the release schedule and also with our cost-cutting plan that is also part of the overall results for that year.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then a housekeeping question, does your current outlook reflects the acquisition of Gearbox, or is that going to be updated next quarter after it's closed?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's not included since the transaction hasn't closed yet. So, we will expect to include it next quarter when we close, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to our management results.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First question, on GTA VI, with the narrowed window of release, is there any associated changes to your plan regarding the live service portion of GTA VI?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Rockstar hasn't given any details on what its expectations are for the release. It's been a wonderful trailer that they put out that broke the internet. And more news will come from Rockstar in the fullness of time.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you. I have a second question, on NBA, how is NBA's transition challenges in between console generations compared to other annually releasing titles on the market, either from 2K or from, you know, other external competitors? And do you attribute the challenges to -- mostly to 2K or to market?Karl Slatoff -- President I'm sorry, was your question about the transition from console generation from the last transition to this transition?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Right.Karl Slatoff -- President OK. So, that's going back quite some time; and frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 9 game and Gen 8 game, is much broader, and I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two games. And frankly, I can't even remember if we had two completely separate games back then. But in any case, the delta is quite significant this time around, so I would expect that the transition is more -- the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst If you do, how does it compare to other studios with annually recurring titles?Karl Slatoff -- President Yeah. We're not really commenting on our competitors. And most of our other studios, we don't have as much -- because NBA comes out every year, so you're going to see that transition more brightly. We don't have the same effect in most of our other games. Occasionally, we would, but they wouldn't be comparable games to NBA anyway. And again, like I said, we don't really comment about the -- our competitors and their experiences.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, Karl.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Hey, Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nicole. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Strauss, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your expectations for the commercial impact from GTA VI have increased. I'm just curious if you could explain what's driving that up enthusiasm for the game. And then the second question, on your guidance, curious why you're not providing medium term. You've done that before, and it feels like, here, you have at least better visibility on the primary catalyst driving that growth. And then on '27, tying into that question, wondering where your confidence is that you can grow sequentially off '26. Is that sort of primarily the GTA ecosystem driving that growth in '27 or it's a combination of that and other AAA games that you plan to release? Thanks, guys.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold-in over 200 million units. Every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game. And engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% and Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage of the game, more than 10 years after the initial release. So, I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course, expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers. In terms of your question, I think you're asking in your second question, you know, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for our top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think, now, we're being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect, relating to your third question, sequential growth on top line, and we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question, is that driven by the GTA ecosystem? The answer is, certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem and, again, given that full-game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming, about which we're highly optimistic. And of course, we have current hits in the marketplace. Match Factory is a huge hit and only accelerating.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Thanks. Thanks, Strauss. Good luck, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I could just ask a big picture one that's two parts. When you come out of the activity you just went through in terms of reevaluating your pipeline and looking at resource allocation across the organization, what were some of the key learnings on right -- the right mix of content is for you guys to meet your hurdle rate going forward and what were some of the key learnings of how much of the resource allocation decisions are now setting the company up on a multiyear view, or do you think they're going to be a continued refinement as you look to marry resources and the IP pipeline in the years ahead? Thanks so much.Karl Slatoff -- President So, in terms of looking at our pipeline, I mean, this is not really new to us. This is a process that we go through -- that we've been going through for at least the last 17 years since I've been here. And -- but what we -- what we're looking for specifically around this, this -- the look that we just took, is that we're looking -- we -- look, we understand in the industry right now that the biggest games are winning, and they're taking more share. And that's obviously a fact that we've noticed and take very seriously. And we're simply looking for the projects that we think have the highest chance for commercial success and for critical success and going through and combing through those and going through our pipeline and then making the tough choices. It's always difficult to cancel any projects. But in this context, it was something that was necessary and really part of our normalized process. So, we can -- we absolutely expect that that will continue in the future. This was a pretty tough look and a pretty big look, so I think most of that is behind us. But we will be adding and we will be subtracting over the next few years, and that's part of what we do. And it'll be both with the -- we will continue to invest in new IP as well. That is not off the table for us. That's very important. That's the lifeblood of the industry. And if you're not investing in new IP, we think it's a big mistake.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst I just had one question on GTA VI. This narrowing from calendar '25 to the fall of '25, do you think there's an ancillary benefit to that of sort of syncing up with the holiday season, or do you feel like GTA is such a powerful franchise that it really doesn't confer any sort of incremental benefit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of James Heaney with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. What have been some of the unlocks on the mobile side of the business? You did call out the better-than-expected results in Zynga's IP business, but just curious if there's anything you could say specifically on the advertising side of the business. Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, we have two important businesses within mobile, in-app purchases and advertising, and they're both relevant. We took a hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blend of hybrid-casual business where there are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business. With regard to in-app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has, and our ability to grow in-app purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hit titles. That's what we're focused on.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm curious if you guys would talk about the broader PC strategy. I know that there's just tons and tons of engagement, particularly for GTA on PC. Not all of that gets monetized. I think, in the past, you've described that as, you know, maybe it's a good thing to have that there. You don't necessarily need to monetize all of it. But there are some interesting products out there, Overwolf and the like. And so, maybe I'm just curious what you guys are seeing or thinking about your opportunity to unlock monetization on PC. Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we look at the PC platform as we do with any platform, and it all starts with content, first and foremost. And we agree, it's a very powerful platform and we've got some very strong third-party partners, also the ability for us to sell directly to the consumer. So, these are all compelling things for us, and we'll continue to develop and support the PC platform as long as the gamer is there. Wherever the gamer is, that's where we're going to be. And again, I don't really see us looking at the PC monetization any differently than we would on any other platform. It really is more about game-to-game. You know, what works for certain games, what doesn't work for certain games. And the overarching edict that we live by is over-deliver on content and the monetization will follow.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Karl.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking the questions. We saw Rockstar announce a price increase for GTA+. I recognize it's been several years, but can you help us think through the rationale? And as you look ahead to GTA VI, what are your latest thoughts around the pricing dynamics for the franchise or your portfolio, in general, as these games continue to get larger with more robust experiences? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and, you know, we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer, that the experience vastly over-delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Sure. I have two questions, one on mobile and then just one again on the sequential growth. So, is there any more color at all you can give us on how you're going to grow sequentially in fiscal '27 after lapping just such a tough comp in fiscal '26 when GTA VI is going to launch? It just seems counterintuitive. When I look back at the last two times Rockstar released a mega title, you know, Red Dead Redemption in fiscal '19, fiscal 20 did not grow; and Grand Theft Auto V in fiscal '14, fiscal 15 was down 30%. I'm just kind of trying to square those couple of things there. You know, will it be Rockstar that continues to drive that sequential growth in fiscal '27? Any more color there would be really great.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, that's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and -- certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. This sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming. We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full-game GTA Vs for over 10 years, and we continue to sell more in a given year than most other stand-alone releases sell in their first year, even at our big competitors' companies. So, we actually think that there's a compelling case that the full-game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline, both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting. We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that, you know, we frankly feel has been right-sized, well-structured, and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. You know, the performance of Match Factory, the performance of Toon Blast, and the stable performance of many other big titles. There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. You know, the -- our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely U.S.- and Western Europe-focused, and we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India, and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply under-penetrated. So, there are numerous, numerous opportunities for growth. But to put your mind at ease, this isn't a, you know, stick a finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. You know, this is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. And along kind of the same lines, I think a lot of people are going to be super excited about GTA VI coming out. Do you make any assumptions about the perhaps reacceleration of growth in the console installed base or console sales, you know, because your title may, you know, bring a lot of lapsed gamers back into the ecosystem in your forecasts?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we're using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So, for Gen 9 alone, their view is that there are about 81 million consoles worldwide currently. That was at the end of the last year. They project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027. Now, you know, we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.OperatorThank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Strauss Zelnick, for any closing comments.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Before we sign off, I just want to thank everyone who works at Take-Two and all of our affiliates. These have been challenging times. And in addition to delivering hits, we've asked everyone to dig deep and make sure the business is highly efficient, right-sized, and that's challenging. And one of the most extraordinary things about our organization is the amazing morale and focus on the common good. We're here for our customers, for our -- first and foremost, for our colleagues who deliver to our customers every day, and for our shareholders. And we're extraordinarily excited, both about the position we're in, about the fiscal year in which we're currently operating, and about our amazing pipeline and the years ahead. Thank you for joining us today.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Nicole Shevins -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsStrauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerKarl Slatoff -- PresidentLainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial OfficerEric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- AnalystDoug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystColin Sebastian -- Robert W.

[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins, senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. Thank you. You may begin.Nicole Shevins -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications Good afternoon.

Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory; and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series. During fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high-quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market. Now, turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the No. 1 basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To date, the title has sold-in over 9 million units. Engagement remains high, with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continued to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences, including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go; NBA 2K Mobile; and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top 5 on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday-themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast. And to date, the title has sold-in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23%, respectively, for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms, according to Streamhatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar's premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts, and we're thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K's renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We've already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox's catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We're also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film, which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest-rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional, with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches. In addition, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series' history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the fall. I'd like to thank our friends Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I'd like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our company. Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a top 20 grossing game in the U.S. Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play Store. We're pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily playtime to around 60 minutes per user. Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons' Treasure competition and many other features. We'd like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth. Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming top 100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I'm highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry-leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet, and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency. And as we deliver our groundbreaking pipeline over the next several years, we're poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.Karl Slatoff -- President Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future, which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline, which includes approximately 40 titles through fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost reduction program, through which we canceled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success. These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to fiscal 2025. We have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA, and, WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live. Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26th. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC. This new ARPG was well-received for its visceral combat, distinct art style, and rich narrative. Private Division, along with Weta Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones: Legends. NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this nonsimulation tactical card battle, players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We're proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for this year. As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including 15 immersive core releases: six of which are sports simulation games; one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and are entering fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult, will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction. We are confident that, over time, these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results. We delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series; and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K2, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+. NBA 2K was in line with the prior year, and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concepts' ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year over year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $42 million, as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million, due to higher external developer advances, cash tax, and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost reduction programs. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year over year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses. We recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year over year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Looking ahead and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to fall of calendar 2025 from calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025 as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever, and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. Now, moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC, and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid-single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year over year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program. In closing, we believe that we are very well-positioned to deliver the highest quality content in our industry and to enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We are extremely excited about our path to the future, and we look forward to sharing more details about the many catalysts ahead for our company. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication to our business and for creating the highest quality, most engaging entertainment franchises that captivate our global audiences. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Gearbox acquisition. In the past, you've expressed that you never really felt the need to own all of Gearbox. Here you are about to own all of Gearbox. Can you talk about how you think about now owning all of Gearbox and some of the opportunities that you'll have with that?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is, when asked when Gearbox was sold to Embracer, whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. You know, we have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he's a hitmaker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and Tiny Tina was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So, we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst OK. And then, Lainie, with regards to the annual cost savings that you announced, how much of that should be seen in fiscal '25?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, we'll start to see it in fiscal '25, but we'll see a full annualization of it in fiscal year '26. So, the majority of the plan was executed in Q4 and Q1, but it's -- pieces of it will come through this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey. Thank you. The ability of Rollic to launch top 100 grossing games is a really pleasant surprise. Just wondering if you could talk about how to think about the life cycle of those games. You know, typically, Rollic's games are sort of -- you know, they're hot for a while, and then they move on to something next -- something else. Is this going to be the case for these monetizing games as well or is it -- it planned to have a longer life cycle? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid-casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hyper-casual approach really was, you know, put it out there, get a bunch of downloads, offer a rather light experience, you know, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted. But, you know, long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content, and Rollic is proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long-lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic. I believe we can. We haven't done so yet, but we're off to a really good start.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a couple for me. I guess, first off, on the change to the guidance and the outlook, what is your level of confidence, Strauss, in that calendar '25 launch of GTA VI, and is there any -- anything else more specific you can talk about what's behind that postponement? And then secondly, on the high single-digit mobile growth, I'm curious how much of that is related to any recovery you're seeing broadly in mobile gaming, or is that more specific to the increase in marketing spend and these titles that are outperforming your expectations for this year? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Colin. Well, we actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga, because we are the market leader, of course, it's driven by the market in which we live. And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year, we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot in UA in the fourth quarter. We did, and that's turned out to be productive spending.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Coss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess between the success you've had with Match Factory and some new launch titles, setting a release date for Star Wars Hunters, and then the incremental marketing behind mobile, it seems like there's definitely more momentum in that business, which is great to see. I guess, when we think about your analytical framework for investing in the marketing behind mobile, what are you targeting from a margin or payback perspective and when should we expect to see this investment turn into profitable flow-through from the mobile side?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, I hope, like everyone else, we look at these very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition; what kind of retention you expect, which is to say what kind of churn you get; the spending that you have on average; and therefore, the lifetime value. And the longer a payback period you're willing to accept, of course, the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data, and they can change at any given time. So, I'm not prepared to share sort of, you know, our outside payback period. Suffice it to say, though, that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you. And when would you expect to see, you know, mobile -- this investment that you're making in mobile flip from a cost center to, you know, driving incremental profit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking, though, which is, frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I declined to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods. We do, however, tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst It does. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, could you address your forecast for NBA 2K RCS in fiscal '25 for a slight increase? Is low single-digits growth the new normal for this going forward, or is there something unique in fiscal '25 that's influencing that view? Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we absolutely expect growth in NBA, and that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full-game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9, and Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we're going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard. And when you look at the recurrent consumer spending, specifically -- when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the charts, it's fantastic. So, we've seen significant growth there. So, again, I think we will have momentum. Just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we're going to continue to see very strong RCS growth.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the change in bookings this year versus what you guys were talking about last quarter, how much comes from moving GTA versus any other shifts versus the restructuring. And then -- yeah, I guess I'll stop there. Thanks.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, for fiscal year '25, the outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window from the calendar 2025 to fall, as we mentioned. There were also some other movements within the release schedule and also with our cost-cutting plan that is also part of the overall results for that year.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then a housekeeping question, does your current outlook reflects the acquisition of Gearbox, or is that going to be updated next quarter after it's closed?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's not included since the transaction hasn't closed yet. So, we will expect to include it next quarter when we close, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to our management results.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First question, on GTA VI, with the narrowed window of release, is there any associated changes to your plan regarding the live service portion of GTA VI?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Rockstar hasn't given any details on what its expectations are for the release. It's been a wonderful trailer that they put out that broke the internet. And more news will come from Rockstar in the fullness of time.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you. I have a second question, on NBA, how is NBA's transition challenges in between console generations compared to other annually releasing titles on the market, either from 2K or from, you know, other external competitors? And do you attribute the challenges to -- mostly to 2K or to market?Karl Slatoff -- President I'm sorry, was your question about the transition from console generation from the last transition to this transition?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Right.Karl Slatoff -- President OK. So, that's going back quite some time; and frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 9 game and Gen 8 game, is much broader, and I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two games. And frankly, I can't even remember if we had two completely separate games back then. But in any case, the delta is quite significant this time around, so I would expect that the transition is more -- the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst If you do, how does it compare to other studios with annually recurring titles?Karl Slatoff -- President Yeah. We're not really commenting on our competitors. And most of our other studios, we don't have as much -- because NBA comes out every year, so you're going to see that transition more brightly. We don't have the same effect in most of our other games. Occasionally, we would, but they wouldn't be comparable games to NBA anyway. And again, like I said, we don't really comment about the -- our competitors and their experiences.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, Karl.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Hey, Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nicole. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Strauss, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your expectations for the commercial impact from GTA VI have increased. I'm just curious if you could explain what's driving that up enthusiasm for the game. And then the second question, on your guidance, curious why you're not providing medium term. You've done that before, and it feels like, here, you have at least better visibility on the primary catalyst driving that growth. And then on '27, tying into that question, wondering where your confidence is that you can grow sequentially off '26. Is that sort of primarily the GTA ecosystem driving that growth in '27 or it's a combination of that and other AAA games that you plan to release? Thanks, guys.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold-in over 200 million units. Every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game. And engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% and Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage of the game, more than 10 years after the initial release. So, I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course, expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers. In terms of your question, I think you're asking in your second question, you know, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for our top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think, now, we're being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect, relating to your third question, sequential growth on top line, and we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question, is that driven by the GTA ecosystem? The answer is, certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem and, again, given that full-game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming, about which we're highly optimistic. And of course, we have current hits in the marketplace. Match Factory is a huge hit and only accelerating.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Thanks. Thanks, Strauss. Good luck, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I could just ask a big picture one that's two parts. When you come out of the activity you just went through in terms of reevaluating your pipeline and looking at resource allocation across the organization, what were some of the key learnings on right -- the right mix of content is for you guys to meet your hurdle rate going forward and what were some of the key learnings of how much of the resource allocation decisions are now setting the company up on a multiyear view, or do you think they're going to be a continued refinement as you look to marry resources and the IP pipeline in the years ahead? Thanks so much.Karl Slatoff -- President So, in terms of looking at our pipeline, I mean, this is not really new to us. This is a process that we go through -- that we've been going through for at least the last 17 years since I've been here. And -- but what we -- what we're looking for specifically around this, this -- the look that we just took, is that we're looking -- we -- look, we understand in the industry right now that the biggest games are winning, and they're taking more share. And that's obviously a fact that we've noticed and take very seriously. And we're simply looking for the projects that we think have the highest chance for commercial success and for critical success and going through and combing through those and going through our pipeline and then making the tough choices. It's always difficult to cancel any projects. But in this context, it was something that was necessary and really part of our normalized process. So, we can -- we absolutely expect that that will continue in the future. This was a pretty tough look and a pretty big look, so I think most of that is behind us. But we will be adding and we will be subtracting over the next few years, and that's part of what we do. And it'll be both with the -- we will continue to invest in new IP as well. That is not off the table for us. That's very important. That's the lifeblood of the industry. And if you're not investing in new IP, we think it's a big mistake.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst I just had one question on GTA VI. This narrowing from calendar '25 to the fall of '25, do you think there's an ancillary benefit to that of sort of syncing up with the holiday season, or do you feel like GTA is such a powerful franchise that it really doesn't confer any sort of incremental benefit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of James Heaney with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. What have been some of the unlocks on the mobile side of the business? You did call out the better-than-expected results in Zynga's IP business, but just curious if there's anything you could say specifically on the advertising side of the business. Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, we have two important businesses within mobile, in-app purchases and advertising, and they're both relevant. We took a hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blend of hybrid-casual business where there are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business. With regard to in-app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has, and our ability to grow in-app purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hit titles. That's what we're focused on.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm curious if you guys would talk about the broader PC strategy. I know that there's just tons and tons of engagement, particularly for GTA on PC. Not all of that gets monetized. I think, in the past, you've described that as, you know, maybe it's a good thing to have that there. You don't necessarily need to monetize all of it. But there are some interesting products out there, Overwolf and the like. And so, maybe I'm just curious what you guys are seeing or thinking about your opportunity to unlock monetization on PC. Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we look at the PC platform as we do with any platform, and it all starts with content, first and foremost. And we agree, it's a very powerful platform and we've got some very strong third-party partners, also the ability for us to sell directly to the consumer. So, these are all compelling things for us, and we'll continue to develop and support the PC platform as long as the gamer is there. Wherever the gamer is, that's where we're going to be. And again, I don't really see us looking at the PC monetization any differently than we would on any other platform. It really is more about game-to-game. You know, what works for certain games, what doesn't work for certain games. And the overarching edict that we live by is over-deliver on content and the monetization will follow.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Karl.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking the questions. We saw Rockstar announce a price increase for GTA+. I recognize it's been several years, but can you help us think through the rationale? And as you look ahead to GTA VI, what are your latest thoughts around the pricing dynamics for the franchise or your portfolio, in general, as these games continue to get larger with more robust experiences? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and, you know, we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer, that the experience vastly over-delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Sure. I have two questions, one on mobile and then just one again on the sequential growth. So, is there any more color at all you can give us on how you're going to grow sequentially in fiscal '27 after lapping just such a tough comp in fiscal '26 when GTA VI is going to launch? It just seems counterintuitive. When I look back at the last two times Rockstar released a mega title, you know, Red Dead Redemption in fiscal '19, fiscal 20 did not grow; and Grand Theft Auto V in fiscal '14, fiscal 15 was down 30%. I'm just kind of trying to square those couple of things there. You know, will it be Rockstar that continues to drive that sequential growth in fiscal '27? Any more color there would be really great.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, that's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and -- certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. This sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming. We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full-game GTA Vs for over 10 years, and we continue to sell more in a given year than most other stand-alone releases sell in their first year, even at our big competitors' companies. So, we actually think that there's a compelling case that the full-game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline, both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting. We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that, you know, we frankly feel has been right-sized, well-structured, and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. You know, the performance of Match Factory, the performance of Toon Blast, and the stable performance of many other big titles. There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. You know, the -- our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely U.S.- and Western Europe-focused, and we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India, and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply under-penetrated. So, there are numerous, numerous opportunities for growth. But to put your mind at ease, this isn't a, you know, stick a finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. You know, this is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. And along kind of the same lines, I think a lot of people are going to be super excited about GTA VI coming out. Do you make any assumptions about the perhaps reacceleration of growth in the console installed base or console sales, you know, because your title may, you know, bring a lot of lapsed gamers back into the ecosystem in your forecasts?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we're using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So, for Gen 9 alone, their view is that there are about 81 million consoles worldwide currently. That was at the end of the last year. They project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027. Now, you know, we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.OperatorThank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Strauss Zelnick, for any closing comments.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Before we sign off, I just want to thank everyone who works at Take-Two and all of our affiliates. These have been challenging times. And in addition to delivering hits, we've asked everyone to dig deep and make sure the business is highly efficient, right-sized, and that's challenging.

      "Applied Materials (AMAT -0.91%)Q2 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 4:30 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, corporate vice president. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our president and CEO; and Brice Hill, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday morning, July 9th, from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m., Applied will host a technology breakfast event at SEMICON West in San Francisco.Joining us will be Dr. Prabu Raja, president of applied semiconductor products group; along with Mark Fuselier, who is senior vice president of technology and product engineering at AMD. After Mark shares AMD's AI computing technology vision, Applied's experts will share our advanced materials engineering road map for making future AI chips. We'll outline device architecture inflections in logic, including transistors, frontside wiring and backside power, along with DRAM, high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging. We hope you'll join us. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mike. With second quarter revenue and earnings toward the high end of our guided range, Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we're in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Semiconductors are the foundation of huge technology trends reshaping the global economy. These trends are driving demand for more chip manufacturing capacity, as well as better chips with higher performance and improved energy efficiency. Key inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials and will support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies move into high-volume production. In addition, the complexity of implementing the industry's road map and bringing new semiconductor technologies to market is driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration with customers, as well as supporting double-digit growth for our service business. In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide some examples of how Applied's innovations are helping to enable multitrillion-dollar technology inflections, including AI. I'll explain how this translates to our performance in the near term and our future growth potential. I'll also describe how we're working with our customers and partners to accelerate major semiconductor inflections, all the way from research and development to high-volume manufacturing, and by doing this, how we are capturing more value in our service business. I'll start with a big-picture perspective. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT and automation, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy will transform virtually every area of the economy over the next several decades. And they all have one thing in common: they are built upon semiconductors. As these new technologies are deployed, they are driving growth and innovation across the semiconductor ecosystem. In terms of impact and scale, I believe AI will be the biggest technology inflection of our lifetimes. And at the heart of AI are some of the world's most sophisticated chips. In simple terms, the advanced chips that power AI data centers are enabled by four key semiconductor technologies: leading-edge logic; compute memory or high-performance DRAM; DRAM stacking technology referred to as high-bandwidth memory, or HBM; and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together and create a system in a package. Applied has process technology leadership in all four of these areas, and we have made significant investments in next-generation solutions to make possible the key device architecture inflections that are essential for our customers' future road maps. In advanced logic, Applied has long-standing leadership in the materials engineering processes for both transistors and interconnects. The first nodes that use gate-all-around transistors are now transitioning to high-volume manufacturing. These new transistor process flows are considerably more complex, and the shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. With the gate-all-around transition, we are also gaining share, and we're on track to capture over 50% of the process equipment spending for transistor steps. We also have very strong market share in interconnect or the wiring used to transmit data at high speed and low power. Our available market for the wiring steps is approximately $6 billion for each 100,000 wafer starts per month, and we expect it to grow by $1 billion when backside power delivery is introduced into volume manufacturing. Overall, we expect to generate more than $2.5 billion of revenue from gate-all-around nodes this year and potentially more than double that in 2025. In DRAM, one of the key approaches that memory makers are using to improve performance and power consumption is to implement logic technologies in the peripheral circuitry. Our deep capabilities in logic, combined with our strong position in DRAM patterning and our unique co-optimized hard-mask solutions for capacitor scaling, makes us the clear leader in process equipment for DRAM today, and best positioned for future growth. In the critical die stacking technologies used in high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, including in micropump and Through Silicon Via. Last quarter, we said that we expected our HBM packaging revenue to be four times larger in 2024 than in 2023. As we have recently seen customers accelerate their capacity plans for HBM, we now believe that our revenue could be 6x higher this year, growing to more than $600 million. Across all device types, we now expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion this year. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted beyond the AI data center, and we introduce new products that expand our served market. AI data center is just one example that illustrates how the major inflections that underpin the next generation of semiconductors are enabled by Applied Materials. Materials science and materials engineering are increasingly important to the industry's road map. Applied has invested early to develop a broad, unique, and connected portfolio of materials engineering solutions that are critical to enable major semiconductor inflections, from AI high-performance computing to ICAPS edge computing. We are translating those investments into consistent outperformance. Recent TechInsights data confirms that in 2023, Applied grew faster than the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We accomplished this despite headwinds created by trade rules that we estimate restricted us from more than 10% of the China market during that period. While we have gained share overall, we are growing share within our served market even faster. This is important because as logic devices become more 3-dimensional, future generations of DRAM come to market and advanced packaging becomes more prevalent, we expect materials engineering to become an even larger portion of overall wafer fab equipment. Another key component of Applied's strategy is to address the increasing complexity faced by the industry. First, we are driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration with customers and partners. We are changing the industry's innovation model with the goal to accelerate mutual success rates and increase investment efficiencies. Our global EPIC platform that we will build out over the next several years is specifically designed to support high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. Second, we are able to provide more complete and connected solutions that accelerate major device inflections. The portion of our revenue generated by integrated solutions has grown from approximately 20% in 2019 to 30% today. We expect demand for these fab-in-a-fab-type solutions to continue growing both at the leading edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty IoT, communications, auto, power, and sensor applications. And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output, and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth of our service business. AGS delivered a new record for revenue this quarter, $1.5 billion, with a significant portion of this coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. Before I hand over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT, EVs, and clean energy, that are reshaping the global economy are built on semiconductors, driving demand for more chips and new chips with higher performance and better energy efficiency. Key device architecture inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials. We expect this to support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies, including gate-all-around logic nodes, high-performance DRAM and HBM, and advanced packaging, move into high-volume production. And finally, the increasingly complex industry road map is driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration between Applied Materials and our customers and partners, accelerating demand for our most advanced, co-optimized, and integrated solutions and supporting double-digit growth in our service business. Now I'll hand over to Brice.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution, which resulted in another strong quarter for revenue and gross margin. Today, I'll discuss our overall business environment and share insights into our ICAPS business, which serves the IoT, communications, auto, power, and sensor markets. I'll describe our capital allocation strategy and operating model, demonstrating how we are driving profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns. I'll also summarize our Q2 results and provide our guidance for Q3. In calendar Q1, the global market for semiconductors grew 15% year over year, and we're optimistic that the data center trends Gary outlined will help drive solid growth for the semiconductor industry. During the quarter, cloud service providers announced strong capital spending plans, which is good news for our customers. In the market briefing we issued earlier this month, we forecast that the data center market will eventually become the No. 1 driver of leading-edge foundry/logic wafer starts, surpassing PCs and then smartphones in the coming years. Within our business, we had a strong quarter in fiscal Q2 across DRAM, advanced packaging, ICAPS, and services. In February, we projected that factory utilization would increase across all device types, and it did. Gary discussed how the data center AI megatrend is driving strong demand for our technologies used in leading-edge logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, and other forms of advanced packaging. Our ICAPS business is driven by three additional megatrends, notably IoT and edge computing, electric and autonomous vehicles, and renewable energy. Across our ICAPS business, one of the largest demand drivers this year is edge computing, especially at the 28-nanometer node needed by smartphone companies and makers of IoT devices for industrial and home automation applications. A second large demand driver is power chips for electric vehicles, where industry leaders are now establishing supply chains to support their long-term growth plans. A third driver is the power chips used to capture renewable solar and wind energy, which are needed to achieve net-zero goals in the decades ahead. We believe our ICAPS business will remain a large portion of our overall foundry/logic business for several reasons. One, the megatrends we described will continue to increase unit demand for ICAPS chips. Two, we are innovating at the device level, which creates better chips, stimulates new system sales and extends Applied's position as the highest-value partner for our customers. And finally, we are introducing ICAPS products in additional market segments, which will help us broaden our reach and gain share. Next, I'll summarize our capital allocation strategy and the results it enables. Our efficient business model generates healthy free cash flow. Our first priority is investing in R&D and capital infrastructure to enable profitable growth. And our second priority is growing our dividend per share and using our buyback program to distribute excess free cash flow to shareholders. Specifically, over the past 10 fiscal years, we have reinvested more than $20 billion in R&D and over $5 billion in capital additions and distributed more than 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy supports our operating model, which I'll summarize. First, we invest over $3 billion in R&D each year, collaborating closely with our customers to invent new semiconductor technologies that are critical to their competitive positions in the global megatrends we've described. Second, we design high-volume manufacturing systems that enable our customers to deploy these new chip and advanced packaging technologies at global scale. Third, we manage a global factory and supply chain network to manufacture these systems. Fourth, we service our systems, which have decades of useful life, helping customers maximize the return on investment by accelerating ramps and optimizing output, yield, and cost. Fifth, we reinvest a high percentage of the profits from this activity back into R&D to develop more new technologies and solutions. And finally, we distribute excess cash to shareholders. An important point is that every tool we manufacture and ship grows our installed base and our service opportunity, which leads to consistent and stable growth for Applied Global Services. In fact, AGS has delivered 19 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth, spanning two memory down cycles. Over 80% of AGS revenue comes from recurring services and parts sales, about two-thirds of which is delivered under long-term service agreements that have a 90% renewal rate. Connecting this to our capital allocation strategy, AGS has continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fully fund our growing dividend. In March 2023, we announced a 23% increase in our dividend per share. And in March of this year, we announced a 25% increase. In summary, over the past 10 fiscal years, our operating model has increased company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33%, and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. Now, I'll summarize our Q2 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew slightly to nearly $6.65 billion, non-GAAP gross margin grew 70 basis points to 47.5%, non-GAAP opex grew 5% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew 4.5% to $2.09. Turning to segment results. Semiconductor systems revenue remained strong at $4.9 billion and included record ion implant sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%. Applied Global Services revenue increased 7% year over year to $1.53 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%. Our tools under subscription agreement increased by 8% year over year, and our installed base of chambers surpassed 200,000 for the first time. Moving to display. Q2 revenue was $179 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 2.8%. We are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook, PCs, and tablets whose larger screen sizes would spur an increase in capital investments. Turning to cash flows in Q2. We generated nearly $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.14 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $820 million in buybacks. We repurchased 4.1 million shares at an average price of $197.77. Now I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue of $6.65 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.01, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.57 billion and display revenue of around $245 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.26 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%. Thank you. And now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please requeue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin. Questions & Answers: OperatorCertainly. And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.C.J. Muse -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess I would love for you to talk about your visibility today and how your ongoing conversations are going with your large customers as it pertains both to your outlook for kind of second half versus first half on a calendar basis, as well as building that potential backlog into calendar '25. Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Great. C.J., thanks for the question. So, when we look at our business and think about the largest customers, as we look at Q3 and our guidance for Q3, we know that the DRAM shipments that we've had for China that we called out that were fairly high in Q1 and Q2 are falling off in the second half. And what we've been expecting is that ICAPS strength and leading logic strength would backfill that drop-off in DRAM. And that's exactly what we see happening in Q3. And that's consistent on the leading logic side with the advent of gate-all-around process technology and equipment beginning to ship in earnest for the HVM ramp that will be upcoming. And I think that's a good indication of what we're expecting in the second half. We talked about whether leading logic and ICAPS would be able to fill in for the drop-off in China DRAM, and that's exactly what we see in Q3. And then when we look ahead to '25, we'll point to the same fundamental ramp for leading logic. That will be gate-all-around. Gary highlighted in his remarks that we expected $2.5 billion of business related to gate-all-around shipments in '24. And we expect to be able to grow that significantly in '25 as that process technology ramps toward HVM, high-volume manufacturing.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please. Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Brice and Gary, I wanted to follow up on that sort of qualitative 2025 outlook. So, I guess I heard you right, you said $2.5 billion gate-all-around this year, doubling next year or more. So, $2.5 billion of incremental year-over-year growth from gate-all-around, it sounds like you said the advanced packaging had the opportunity to double again over time, so that should be growing. HBM, in theory, should be growing. ICAPS, I know, has been a little weaker than it was. It feels like it's bottomed just given what we're seeing that ought to grow. And I mean NAND flash for you guys is pretty close to 0 right now as well. So, I mean how do I think about like -- you've talked about overdelivering versus the market. Like let's say the WFE market was flat next year. Given those drivers, how would I think about how you guys could grow relative to a market like that given those drivers?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. So, our perspective, we start with the longer-term view. And as Gary described, we're investing in the key inflections for the fastest-growing markets. And so, our perspective, if you stand back and think over many quarters or the next several years, is that the leading logic technologies like gate-all-around and backside power, the advanced packaging, HBM memory, our services business, we think all of those will grow faster than the average market and will help us gain share. And so, it's harder to call any particular quarter or a short time period in the near future, but that would be our perspective. And I think from an ICAPS perspective, you called out gate-all-around and ICAPS and DRAM and NAND, I think, thinking about all of them. We've talked about our DRAM share having improved over 10 percentage points over the last 10 years. And we expect that technology has great tailwinds. We talked about how HBM and utilization in DRAM is improving. So, that's a positive. And if we think about ICAPS, the market, we have three quarters here that you can see, our first two that are closed and our Q3 guidance. And ICAPS is very strong in those quarters and grows in Q3 to fill in some of that China DRAM business that drops off. And then finally, gate-all-around, the $2.5 billion that Gary highlighted, that's not just the incremental. That's our shipments for the entire business that are associated with gate-all-around that are shipping this year, and we do expect that to grow next year.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Stacy, this is Gary. Really, the big focus for us is enabling and winning major device architecture inflections. So, when you break out all of these different device segments, certainly, foundry/logic, leading edge, the opportunity there for us to grow is significant because we have a very high share of those big inflections. The gate-all-around, backside power delivery, wiring is a real strength for us. As Brice mentioned, in DRAM, we gained 10 points of overall DRAM share over the last 10 years. And if I look forward at the architecture inflections in DRAM, we're even better positioned. Those will be much more materials-intensive, materials engineering-enabled. And that's going to be a really good position for us. We also talked about packaging. We've increased our view of packaging in '24 to $1.7 billion. But as I mentioned and Brice reiterated, we have an opportunity to double our advanced packaging business. In HBM, we've increased that growth from 4x to 6x this year. And the last one is our services business, 19 consecutive quarters year over year, where we've seen growth. And with these highly complex architecture inflections, it gives us a really great opportunity to add more value with our services business. Also as people are moving into new locations where they don't have an experienced workforce, we've talked about double-digit growth in services. Right now, that's a $6 billion run rate, but that's adding significant growth as we go forward. So, there's just a few other thoughts.Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst But you said $2.5 billion this year from gate-all-around and more than double that in -- did I hear that wrong? Does that suggest $5 billion in gate-all-around in 2025? Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's what --Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Did I misunderstand what you said? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think that math is correct.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's right, Stacy. So, that's not just the increment. That's the entire equipment sales that we'll have for that technology. So, $2.5 billion for this year and the opportunity to double that next year.Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, guys. OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Mark Lipacis -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a question for Gary. Gary, when you talk about like investing more in materials engineering, it seems like you're kind of climbing up the value chain to the place where it used to be your customers' domain. And a lot of times when you see companies moving up the value chain and adding more value, ultimately, you see that reflected in improving margins. So, appreciate that you engage in partnerships and that's the spirit. But like if you're adding more value, it seems like that ultimately, at the end of the day, should come back to you in higher profitability. And I'm wondering if you could just talk philosophically about that. Is that something you would expect to see happen? Or does that manifest in other ways? Thank you. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, if you look at the industry overall, all of our customers are racing to be first to market to deliver those major device architecture inflections that determine their competitive position. So, gate-all-around, backside power, those new DRAM architectures and packaging is becoming more and more important to power performance and costs. So, that is really what shapes the competitive landscape in the industry. And it's very, very clear. We're working with our customers for technology generations out into the future. So, we have very high visibility, and this broad and connected portfolio that we have gives us an opportunity to engage with customers in those early and very deep relationships on those architectural inflections. And as we look forward, we do see materials engineering as a percentage of spend and the relative contribution increasing. And Applied has clear leadership, especially with this broad, connected portfolio. We built integration capability inside Applied that is really tremendous and really co-innovating with our customers as they're driving those architecture inflections. So, I do believe, for sure, that we will be creating more value in those relationships with our customers, and that certainly is valuable for them. And our focus is to capture more value as we're delivering more value with them. So, your basic question, I agree with your thoughts.Mark Lipacis -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thanks, very helpful.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. Gary, maybe back to the gate-all-around. So, you're raising the forecast there by $1 billion. I think on, I think, HBM, you're raising it by another $100 million or so. Is that all going to show up in July and October? So, does it mean that conceptually, the second half of the year is over $1 billion higher than what you thought before? And then on gate-all-around, what is driving such a significant growth versus what you thought before? $1 billion increase over $1.5 billion base is a very strong number. So, I'm just curious, what are the kind of the qualitative factors? And then just also quantitatively, does it mean that second half is $1.1 billion higher than what you thought before?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Vivek, it's Brice. I'll just do a clarification here. We decided last quarter when we talked about the incremental revenue for gate-all-around that it was a little bit confusing. So, we changed -- in this quarter, we're talking about all of our revenue that's associated with the gate-all-around transistor and wiring. And so, that's not just the increment. So, the $2.5 billion that we're talking about this quarter is not supposed to be interpreted as an increase relative to the $1 billion we talked about last quarter. We're just changing the basis. Now we're just quoting all of the business that's associated with the gate-all-around product. So, hopefully, that helps. So, as far as answering the question about what's driving the increase, I don't think our perspective has changed very much. It's $2.5 billion for this year. It can grow significantly next year as the technology ramps. And then what I would say is you do see some of that in our Q3 guide. So, as you know, we took down -- or we're dropping off the incremental China DRAM shipments that we had. And in the second half, we're filling that in with ICAPS strength and growing leading logic shipments that are driven by gate-all-around. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Vivek, let me add, relative to kind of what drives the incremental spending, these technologies where you're improving device performance to drive current, leakage, power consumption, all of those things, are incredibly difficult. And so, the customers -- and it's really all about this materials magic that we're able to provide with that broad portfolio of different types of technologies. So, step counts are increasing at every one of those different technology nodes as they are driving those road maps for performance power to meet the -- especially for high-performance computing, AI computing demand type of applications. So, again, those are very, very, very difficult technologies. Whether it's 100 billion transistors in a GPU or 100 kilometers of wiring in an applications processor, those are really amazing, amazing technology accomplishments with materials. That's what drives that incremental spending. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Yes, thank you. Good evening. The question is on advanced packaging. And you were pretty specific with what you're expecting this year. You spoke about the opportunity to double that again. You didn't provide a time frame on that. So, if you could help us with some of the time frame on when you expect to double that? And just in terms of what's driving that, we know there's advanced packaging in logic and HBM. What's the mix of that in terms of what's driving the expectations higher? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Chris, this is Gary. So, the whole focus around advanced packaging heterogeneous integration is really a major drive across the entire industry. When you look at AI servers or any of these different kinds of applications, you see tremendous innovation in the high-bandwidth memory. You see tremendous innovation in how you're connecting together all of those high-performance logic chips and memory chips. And we really see the growth there being very, very significant because it's so important to the industry's road map as kind of classic Moore's Law has slowed down significantly. This is another major driver of how the industry will innovate going forward. And with Applied, we have the broadest portfolio of technologies, PVD, CVD, CMP plating, etch. We've added hybrid bonding, digital lithography, eBeam test. We have a very broad portfolio. And as we see those road maps -- and this is why I come back to architecture inflections are really what drives your incremental business going forward. So, we can see the road maps for our foundry/logic customers, for memory customers. All of them are investing very heavily in these types of technologies. And some of these areas also that are new innovations from Applied will help us drive that business two times higher. And I think that the compound annual growth rate keeps going up from there. The other advantage that we have besides this broad portfolio in the deep, multi-generation connection that we have with all of our customers is our full-flow packaging lab in Singapore. We're working with leading customers on those next-generation innovations, Chris. So, we have a pretty good line of sight to what those inflections look like, the architecture inflections will look like in a very strong position to grow our share as those inflections come to market. We're not giving a specific time frame on the doubling. It will happen over a number of years. But very, very optimistic about our opportunities in packaging.Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please. Srini Pajjuri -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thank you. Brice, I have a question on China. I think last quarter, you said you expect China to normalize to about 30% or so by the end of this year. So, my question is, is that still the expectation? And then it looks like ICAPS is still holding up pretty well. So, is the decline primarily DRAM going forward? And I'm just curious as to given what we are hearing about what we're seeing in the end markets of ICAPS, I mean it looks like the broader analog is still relatively weak and auto is kind of mixed. I'm just curious as to what's driving the strength in ICAPS. Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thanks, Srini. Yes, first of all, our mix as we move to the second half of the year will normalize with respect to China as a percent of our total revenue. So, it will be closer to 30% as expected. And it's the dynamic that you highlighted. We had some catch-up DRAM shipments to particular customers in China for the last three quarters. Those will fall off as we go through Q3 and Q4, and that really will bring our percentage of China revenue back down closer to what's average over the last few years, which we'll call about 30%. And then with respect to the mix of business. So, as that DRAM business falls off, our ICAPS business and our leading-edge logic business does increase to fill that in. And so, that's consistent with continued strength in ICAPS, which the rest of the market for us in China would be ICAPS-related. And I think you described it well. The end markets are mixed. So, industrial and auto have been weaker. Smartphone, PC-related products have been slow but gaining some strength recently. And then as we've talked about image sensors, power chips, micro-controllers, a lot of those markets have been stronger. So, it's been mixed end markets, but the customers are investing for forward-looking demand and to get capacity in place for forward-looking demand. And when we see utilization in those markets, we've seen it improve. So, I think when people ask us for guidance, hopefully, the best thing we can tell you is Q1 and Q2 were very strong in ICAPS, and Q3 will be another strong quarter in the ICAPS market. Thanks for the question.Srini Pajjuri -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thanks, Brice.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please. Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on gate-all-around as well. Very strong outlook, $2.5 billion, doubling to next year. Is the customer funnel for this demand pretty broad across the four foundries? And also if you can rank order for us in the $2.5 billion FE, ALD, patterning. What's driving the most demand? Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer I'll take the first part. I think that demand is across our customer base. So, it's not one single customer, but we won't share any details about the relative balance between customers. And then from a device mix perspective, Gary -- or I'm sorry, equipment mix, I don't know if there's anything you would highlight there. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think again, one of the advantages that we have is this broad portfolio of technologies along with integrated tools and also our integration engineering, where we're working with customers, they're really co-innovating on these different technology inflections. So, if you look at gate-all-around, we have FE, PVD, ALD, selective removal etch, thermal processing, implant, CMP and eBeam. So, it's a very broad -- a broad portfolio. And I'm not going to break out all of those different pieces. But what I would say is our ability to connect that portfolio together is really a tremendous strength in our ability to co-optimize as you're thinking about -- and we've done this back in FinFET also, where we were able to co-optimize and innovate in how you're building those structures so that you can improve power and performance. And we're doing the same thing with gate-all-around.OperatorDoes that answer your question?Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Yes, thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two quick ones, one on HBM and the other one on NAND. So, in HBM, your customers would tell us that they're sold out, certainly for '24. For the most part, they're sold out for '25 as well. So, my guess is you've got pretty good visibility into next year. Gary, you talked about overall advanced packaging doubling over the medium to long term. But when you zoom into HBM, could that business for you multiply again in '25 on a year-over-year basis? And then on the NAND side, the business continues to be pretty depressed. Your customers, their profitability is improving. Cash flow is improving or becoming less bad. Are you starting to see purchase orders from your customers come back? Or what do they need to see for them to spend on WFE again? Thank you. Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll start and then Gary may add something on the HBM. So, on the sold-out comment, what we do -- we have seen utilizations improve across the DRAM wafer starts. We've seen the allocation to HBM from a wafer start perspective increase from 5% to probably something closer to 20%. That said, it's not 100% utilized. So, you could speculate what the -- if there's some restraints, it could be in the packaging side, and we have seen orders for HBM going up. So, we'll have to let you think about that and talk to those vendors from that perspective. On the NAND side, our perspective on NAND is that Moore's Law is still very much alive in NAND. The bit density is increasing with each generation of NAND fairly aggressively, and it's meeting the demand function for increased bits. And what that really means is that the business we see in NAND is for technology upgrades, more technology upgrades, not really new wafer starts. So, that's what we expect to see as we move forward. And overall, we expect NAND to grow at the speed of semiconductors. Obviously, storage has a very important part, and several of the vendors called out how important storage is even for AI and that it will grow. So, I think for us, it's been slow, but we expect it to grow over time and memory in total to be about a third of our sales for WFE. And then, Gary, back to you whether anything specific on HBM.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Really, Toshiya, nothing really too much more beyond what Brice was talking about. And we have seen the demand for HBM strengthening. We went from about 4x increase to 6x increase from the last time that we talked to you guys. And I would say that we still are seeing incremental demand going forward. So, that pull is still there from customers. We're not giving any point estimate for next year, but we do continue to see stronger demand in that segment.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please. Krish Sankar -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on backside power delivery. It seems that the industry has two approaches to it. One is the backside wiring with direct contact with the transistors. Another once is the nano-TFE approach. I'm kind of curious. You've spoken about the incremental $1 billion SAM for 100,000 wafer starts per month. How does it split between those two approaches? And also, can you quantify what kind of revenues you expect this year and next year for Applied in backside power deliveries? Thank you.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Krish, yeah, I don't want to talk too much about the specific architectures that customers are using. That's confidential for all of those different customers. I would say that going forward, that direct connect to the backside is the path that everybody is focused on. So, I think over time, that will grow a fairly significant amount -- well, both of those approaches will grow a fairly significant amount. And we're deeply engaged with customers on that inflection. We're leading in wiring overall. We have a very, very high share of wiring. And so, wiring going to the backside, we've said that, that gives us an opportunity of 50% of that spend when that inflection happens. So, we're supporting both of those different types of approaches for the backside, but I don't want to get too specific in terms of which one do we see bigger over time. I think that it could move to the direct connect. But that timing, I don't want to give specifically because that's going to be each one of different customers' road maps. Relative to timing for revenue, it's pretty small for us right now in 2024. It will grow in '25, but the significant ramp for backside power is still out beyond '25 in revenue.Krish Sankar -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Thanks, Gary.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please. Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks a lot, Brice, I had a 2-part question on China DRAM. And the first part is you talked about it coming down $500 million. Is that stepping all the way down in fiscal Q3? So, what's the assumed step-down in China DRAM for fiscal Q3? And then more broadly, of the $1.6 billion worth of DRAM business, I'm wondering if you can kind of help us figure out how much of that is China. If I look at Korea and I look at how much that did, it looks like about $1 billion of the $1.6 billion DRAM revenue is China. Can you confirm whether that's in the right ballpark? Thanks. Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Tim, thanks for the question. The only quantification that I gave in prior quarters was that our DRAM as a whole was up more than $500 million in the quarters where we had that incremental. So, I think I'll just leave it at that and say it's more than $500 million in each of the last three quarters. And as we look into the second half, it doesn't drop completely to 0 in Q3, but it drops significantly, and then it's pretty close to zero in Q4. And our mix to China revenue for the company, as I highlighted to an earlier question, will be about in the range of 30%, which is normal for us. So, I think that's as close as I can get on that. Thanks for the question.Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst Sure, Bryce, thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of try to understand just the trends that you're seeing in ICAPS. Can you help us just understand the difference in the growth that you're seeing from China versus non-China? Because it sounds like as we look at China revenue normalizing, the DRAM falling off, obviously, the rest of that is mostly just ICAPS. So, can you help us just kind of understand the trends between China and non-China?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Joe, thanks for the question. Yes, for China, what I would say is the last three quarters have been very strong. So, if we're speculating about a slowdown or a digestion period, one of the reasons I didn't reemphasize that is we're kind of going by what we're seeing. So, we had two strong quarters, Q1, Q2. Our Q3 guide again has strength in ICAPS and a strong fourth quarter for China. When we think about the world right now, I think we have three regions growing and the rest of the regions not growing. So, that corresponds with the end markets sort of being mixed at this point. Our view of China overall, the team showed a pie chart of the different device elements of WFE last year. ICAPS was about 40% of WFE by that pie chart on May 2nd that was put out. China is our largest market in ICAPS, and we monitor that carefully. We've got a large number of customers. We're tracking about 30 different -- more than 30 factory projects that are in ramp process. In other words, they have capacity. They're adding capacity. They're ramping. We're tracking utilizations. Utilizations are improving. We understand yields are improving. So, we think that the China market will be a very large and important market for us going forward. We said we don't see a cliff for that market, and I think we'd stick by all those remarks at this point.Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As we transition from a more mature specialty ICAPS-driven growth profile to a leading edge, sort of advanced foundry/logic memory spending profile this year and going forward, this typically tends to be a strong tailwind for your process control and diagnostics portfolio, which leans very heavily on your most advanced tools and solutions, right? Because picture sizes get smaller, so better resolution required, but also new and more defecting yield challenges, right? So, it's probably a driver of your leading-edge CFE-driven eBeam portfolio this year. Are you guys still seeing that portfolio grow like 4x this year? And how does the pipeline look for next year? And maybe mid- to longer term, like given the significant manufacturability challenges, does the Applied team see process control and diagnostics intensity rising faster than overall WFE intensity over the next few years? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Harlan. This is Gary. So, I would say that for sure, the connection that we have with our eBeam technology and these major architecture inflections is a real advantage for us because, again, it's a race on who gets there first relative to those major architecture inflections and learning rate. How fast you learn is one of the determining factors. So, having this unique capability is a real advantage for Applied. I mean obviously, it's a good growth driver for us from a revenue perspective. But that synergy with the rest of our broad portfolio, our connected portfolio, is a real advantage. On cold field emission, which is really one of the key technologies in the electron optics, it gives us the highest resolution, adds up to 10x higher imaging speeds. So, it really is highly differentiated. And we are still on track this year to grow our CFE systems revenue around 4x in '24, and that would represent about 50% of our total eBeam system sales. And then when I look forward, again, I see PDC as a really great growth driver for Applied. We've had the strongest pipeline of new products than we've ever had. And the synergy with the rest of our process equipment business, all of that materials magic, materials innovation is increasing. So, again, very, very optimistic about the shape of that business.Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thank you, Gary.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Yeah, thanks, Harlan. And operator, we have time for just one more quick question, please.OperatorCertainly. One moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please. Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Yes, sir. Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Gary, you were talking about this inflection point technology, leading-edge logic, HBM, DRAM, and advanced packaging. But would it be fair to say that what is not in your backlog is the additional wafer capacity, especially for gate-all-around and memory, and that would be something that would be coming in, the POs be placed later this year for shipment in 2025?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Mehdi, it's Brice. I guess I'll take that one. We do expect -- I can't tell if it's a greenfield question or not, but we do expect increased wafer starts across definitely ICAPS, definitely leading logic, a smaller amount in DRAM. And probably the place where we don't really expect increased wafer starts is in NAND, but that will still be upgrades. So, most of the memory technologies are upgrades. But it will be a combination of new technologies and new plant and equipment across the board.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Thank you.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President OK. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And now, Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts? Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mike. I think we've done a good job anticipating the road map inflections in data center AI. We can see the pull for our solutions in gate-all-around chips, from transistors to frontside wiring and backside wiring and in advanced packaging. Same goes for DRAM, where we're No. 1 in materials engineering and especially strong in HBM stacking. In future calls, we'll have a lot more to say about our positions in edge, AI and IoT plus automotive, and clean energy, which are very big and long-term drivers of our ICAPS business. The momentum in our systems business fuels our service business, which is driving very stable subscription-like growth and helping us increase the dividend at an accelerated rate. Gary will be at the Bernstein Conference in New York on May 30th, and I hope to see many of you at the BofA conference in San Francisco on June 6th. Thank you, Mike. Let's close the call.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President OK. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.

      "Applied Materials (AMAT -0.91%)Q2 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 4:30 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, corporate vice president. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our president and CEO; and Brice Hill, our chief financial officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday morning, July 9th, from 7:30 to 9:00 a.m., Applied will host a technology breakfast event at SEMICON West in San Francisco.Joining us will be Dr. Prabu Raja, president of applied semiconductor products group; along with Mark Fuselier, who is senior vice president of technology and product engineering at AMD. After Mark shares AMD's AI computing technology vision, Applied's experts will share our advanced materials engineering road map for making future AI chips. We'll outline device architecture inflections in logic, including transistors, frontside wiring and backside power, along with DRAM, high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging. We hope you'll join us. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mike. With second quarter revenue and earnings toward the high end of our guided range, Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we're in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Semiconductors are the foundation of huge technology trends reshaping the global economy. These trends are driving demand for more chip manufacturing capacity, as well as better chips with higher performance and improved energy efficiency. Key inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials and will support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies move into high-volume production. In addition, the complexity of implementing the industry's road map and bringing new semiconductor technologies to market is driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration with customers, as well as supporting double-digit growth for our service business. In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide some examples of how Applied's innovations are helping to enable multitrillion-dollar technology inflections, including AI. I'll explain how this translates to our performance in the near term and our future growth potential. I'll also describe how we're working with our customers and partners to accelerate major semiconductor inflections, all the way from research and development to high-volume manufacturing, and by doing this, how we are capturing more value in our service business. I'll start with a big-picture perspective. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT and automation, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy will transform virtually every area of the economy over the next several decades. And they all have one thing in common: they are built upon semiconductors. As these new technologies are deployed, they are driving growth and innovation across the semiconductor ecosystem. In terms of impact and scale, I believe AI will be the biggest technology inflection of our lifetimes. And at the heart of AI are some of the world's most sophisticated chips. In simple terms, the advanced chips that power AI data centers are enabled by four key semiconductor technologies: leading-edge logic; compute memory or high-performance DRAM; DRAM stacking technology referred to as high-bandwidth memory, or HBM; and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together and create a system in a package. Applied has process technology leadership in all four of these areas, and we have made significant investments in next-generation solutions to make possible the key device architecture inflections that are essential for our customers' future road maps. In advanced logic, Applied has long-standing leadership in the materials engineering processes for both transistors and interconnects. The first nodes that use gate-all-around transistors are now transitioning to high-volume manufacturing. These new transistor process flows are considerably more complex, and the shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. With the gate-all-around transition, we are also gaining share, and we're on track to capture over 50% of the process equipment spending for transistor steps. We also have very strong market share in interconnect or the wiring used to transmit data at high speed and low power. Our available market for the wiring steps is approximately $6 billion for each 100,000 wafer starts per month, and we expect it to grow by $1 billion when backside power delivery is introduced into volume manufacturing. Overall, we expect to generate more than $2.5 billion of revenue from gate-all-around nodes this year and potentially more than double that in 2025. In DRAM, one of the key approaches that memory makers are using to improve performance and power consumption is to implement logic technologies in the peripheral circuitry. Our deep capabilities in logic, combined with our strong position in DRAM patterning and our unique co-optimized hard-mask solutions for capacitor scaling, makes us the clear leader in process equipment for DRAM today, and best positioned for future growth. In the critical die stacking technologies used in high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, including in micropump and Through Silicon Via. Last quarter, we said that we expected our HBM packaging revenue to be four times larger in 2024 than in 2023. As we have recently seen customers accelerate their capacity plans for HBM, we now believe that our revenue could be 6x higher this year, growing to more than $600 million. Across all device types, we now expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion this year. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted beyond the AI data center, and we introduce new products that expand our served market. AI data center is just one example that illustrates how the major inflections that underpin the next generation of semiconductors are enabled by Applied Materials. Materials science and materials engineering are increasingly important to the industry's road map. Applied has invested early to develop a broad, unique, and connected portfolio of materials engineering solutions that are critical to enable major semiconductor inflections, from AI high-performance computing to ICAPS edge computing. We are translating those investments into consistent outperformance. Recent TechInsights data confirms that in 2023, Applied grew faster than the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We accomplished this despite headwinds created by trade rules that we estimate restricted us from more than 10% of the China market during that period. While we have gained share overall, we are growing share within our served market even faster. This is important because as logic devices become more 3-dimensional, future generations of DRAM come to market and advanced packaging becomes more prevalent, we expect materials engineering to become an even larger portion of overall wafer fab equipment. Another key component of Applied's strategy is to address the increasing complexity faced by the industry. First, we are driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration with customers and partners. We are changing the industry's innovation model with the goal to accelerate mutual success rates and increase investment efficiencies. Our global EPIC platform that we will build out over the next several years is specifically designed to support high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. Second, we are able to provide more complete and connected solutions that accelerate major device inflections. The portion of our revenue generated by integrated solutions has grown from approximately 20% in 2019 to 30% today. We expect demand for these fab-in-a-fab-type solutions to continue growing both at the leading edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty IoT, communications, auto, power, and sensor applications. And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output, and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth of our service business. AGS delivered a new record for revenue this quarter, $1.5 billion, with a significant portion of this coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. Before I hand over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer term. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT, EVs, and clean energy, that are reshaping the global economy are built on semiconductors, driving demand for more chips and new chips with higher performance and better energy efficiency. Key device architecture inflections that underpin the semiconductor road map are enabled by Applied Materials. We expect this to support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies, including gate-all-around logic nodes, high-performance DRAM and HBM, and advanced packaging, move into high-volume production. And finally, the increasingly complex industry road map is driving earlier, deeper, and broader collaboration between Applied Materials and our customers and partners, accelerating demand for our most advanced, co-optimized, and integrated solutions and supporting double-digit growth in our service business. Now I'll hand over to Brice.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution, which resulted in another strong quarter for revenue and gross margin. Today, I'll discuss our overall business environment and share insights into our ICAPS business, which serves the IoT, communications, auto, power, and sensor markets. I'll describe our capital allocation strategy and operating model, demonstrating how we are driving profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns. I'll also summarize our Q2 results and provide our guidance for Q3. In calendar Q1, the global market for semiconductors grew 15% year over year, and we're optimistic that the data center trends Gary outlined will help drive solid growth for the semiconductor industry. During the quarter, cloud service providers announced strong capital spending plans, which is good news for our customers. In the market briefing we issued earlier this month, we forecast that the data center market will eventually become the No. 1 driver of leading-edge foundry/logic wafer starts, surpassing PCs and then smartphones in the coming years. Within our business, we had a strong quarter in fiscal Q2 across DRAM, advanced packaging, ICAPS, and services. In February, we projected that factory utilization would increase across all device types, and it did. Gary discussed how the data center AI megatrend is driving strong demand for our technologies used in leading-edge logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, and other forms of advanced packaging. Our ICAPS business is driven by three additional megatrends, notably IoT and edge computing, electric and autonomous vehicles, and renewable energy. Across our ICAPS business, one of the largest demand drivers this year is edge computing, especially at the 28-nanometer node needed by smartphone companies and makers of IoT devices for industrial and home automation applications. A second large demand driver is power chips for electric vehicles, where industry leaders are now establishing supply chains to support their long-term growth plans. A third driver is the power chips used to capture renewable solar and wind energy, which are needed to achieve net-zero goals in the decades ahead. We believe our ICAPS business will remain a large portion of our overall foundry/logic business for several reasons. One, the megatrends we described will continue to increase unit demand for ICAPS chips. Two, we are innovating at the device level, which creates better chips, stimulates new system sales and extends Applied's position as the highest-value partner for our customers. And finally, we are introducing ICAPS products in additional market segments, which will help us broaden our reach and gain share. Next, I'll summarize our capital allocation strategy and the results it enables. Our efficient business model generates healthy free cash flow. Our first priority is investing in R&D and capital infrastructure to enable profitable growth. And our second priority is growing our dividend per share and using our buyback program to distribute excess free cash flow to shareholders. Specifically, over the past 10 fiscal years, we have reinvested more than $20 billion in R&D and over $5 billion in capital additions and distributed more than 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy supports our operating model, which I'll summarize. First, we invest over $3 billion in R&D each year, collaborating closely with our customers to invent new semiconductor technologies that are critical to their competitive positions in the global megatrends we've described. Second, we design high-volume manufacturing systems that enable our customers to deploy these new chip and advanced packaging technologies at global scale. Third, we manage a global factory and supply chain network to manufacture these systems. Fourth, we service our systems, which have decades of useful life, helping customers maximize the return on investment by accelerating ramps and optimizing output, yield, and cost. Fifth, we reinvest a high percentage of the profits from this activity back into R&D to develop more new technologies and solutions. And finally, we distribute excess cash to shareholders. An important point is that every tool we manufacture and ship grows our installed base and our service opportunity, which leads to consistent and stable growth for Applied Global Services. In fact, AGS has delivered 19 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth, spanning two memory down cycles. Over 80% of AGS revenue comes from recurring services and parts sales, about two-thirds of which is delivered under long-term service agreements that have a 90% renewal rate. Connecting this to our capital allocation strategy, AGS has continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fully fund our growing dividend. In March 2023, we announced a 23% increase in our dividend per share. And in March of this year, we announced a 25% increase. In summary, over the past 10 fiscal years, our operating model has increased company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33%, and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. Now, I'll summarize our Q2 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew slightly to nearly $6.65 billion, non-GAAP gross margin grew 70 basis points to 47.5%, non-GAAP opex grew 5% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew 4.5% to $2.09. Turning to segment results. Semiconductor systems revenue remained strong at $4.9 billion and included record ion implant sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%. Applied Global Services revenue increased 7% year over year to $1.53 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%. Our tools under subscription agreement increased by 8% year over year, and our installed base of chambers surpassed 200,000 for the first time. Moving to display. Q2 revenue was $179 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 2.8%. We are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook, PCs, and tablets whose larger screen sizes would spur an increase in capital investments. Turning to cash flows in Q2. We generated nearly $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.14 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $820 million in buybacks. We repurchased 4.1 million shares at an average price of $197.77. Now I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue of $6.65 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.01, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.57 billion and display revenue of around $245 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.26 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%. Thank you. And now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please requeue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin. Questions & Answers: OperatorCertainly. And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.C.J. Muse -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess I would love for you to talk about your visibility today and how your ongoing conversations are going with your large customers as it pertains both to your outlook for kind of second half versus first half on a calendar basis, as well as building that potential backlog into calendar '25. Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Great. C.J., thanks for the question. So, when we look at our business and think about the largest customers, as we look at Q3 and our guidance for Q3, we know that the DRAM shipments that we've had for China that we called out that were fairly high in Q1 and Q2 are falling off in the second half. And what we've been expecting is that ICAPS strength and leading logic strength would backfill that drop-off in DRAM. And that's exactly what we see happening in Q3. And that's consistent on the leading logic side with the advent of gate-all-around process technology and equipment beginning to ship in earnest for the HVM ramp that will be upcoming. And I think that's a good indication of what we're expecting in the second half. We talked about whether leading logic and ICAPS would be able to fill in for the drop-off in China DRAM, and that's exactly what we see in Q3. And then when we look ahead to '25, we'll point to the same fundamental ramp for leading logic. That will be gate-all-around. Gary highlighted in his remarks that we expected $2.5 billion of business related to gate-all-around shipments in '24. And we expect to be able to grow that significantly in '25 as that process technology ramps toward HVM, high-volume manufacturing.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please. Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Brice and Gary, I wanted to follow up on that sort of qualitative 2025 outlook. So, I guess I heard you right, you said $2.5 billion gate-all-around this year, doubling next year or more. So, $2.5 billion of incremental year-over-year growth from gate-all-around, it sounds like you said the advanced packaging had the opportunity to double again over time, so that should be growing. HBM, in theory, should be growing. ICAPS, I know, has been a little weaker than it was. It feels like it's bottomed just given what we're seeing that ought to grow. And I mean NAND flash for you guys is pretty close to 0 right now as well. So, I mean how do I think about like -- you've talked about overdelivering versus the market. Like let's say the WFE market was flat next year. Given those drivers, how would I think about how you guys could grow relative to a market like that given those drivers?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. So, our perspective, we start with the longer-term view. And as Gary described, we're investing in the key inflections for the fastest-growing markets. And so, our perspective, if you stand back and think over many quarters or the next several years, is that the leading logic technologies like gate-all-around and backside power, the advanced packaging, HBM memory, our services business, we think all of those will grow faster than the average market and will help us gain share. And so, it's harder to call any particular quarter or a short time period in the near future, but that would be our perspective. And I think from an ICAPS perspective, you called out gate-all-around and ICAPS and DRAM and NAND, I think, thinking about all of them. We've talked about our DRAM share having improved over 10 percentage points over the last 10 years. And we expect that technology has great tailwinds. We talked about how HBM and utilization in DRAM is improving. So, that's a positive. And if we think about ICAPS, the market, we have three quarters here that you can see, our first two that are closed and our Q3 guidance. And ICAPS is very strong in those quarters and grows in Q3 to fill in some of that China DRAM business that drops off. And then finally, gate-all-around, the $2.5 billion that Gary highlighted, that's not just the incremental. That's our shipments for the entire business that are associated with gate-all-around that are shipping this year, and we do expect that to grow next year.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Stacy, this is Gary. Really, the big focus for us is enabling and winning major device architecture inflections. So, when you break out all of these different device segments, certainly, foundry/logic, leading edge, the opportunity there for us to grow is significant because we have a very high share of those big inflections. The gate-all-around, backside power delivery, wiring is a real strength for us. As Brice mentioned, in DRAM, we gained 10 points of overall DRAM share over the last 10 years. And if I look forward at the architecture inflections in DRAM, we're even better positioned. Those will be much more materials-intensive, materials engineering-enabled. And that's going to be a really good position for us. We also talked about packaging. We've increased our view of packaging in '24 to $1.7 billion. But as I mentioned and Brice reiterated, we have an opportunity to double our advanced packaging business. In HBM, we've increased that growth from 4x to 6x this year. And the last one is our services business, 19 consecutive quarters year over year, where we've seen growth. And with these highly complex architecture inflections, it gives us a really great opportunity to add more value with our services business. Also as people are moving into new locations where they don't have an experienced workforce, we've talked about double-digit growth in services. Right now, that's a $6 billion run rate, but that's adding significant growth as we go forward. So, there's just a few other thoughts.Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst But you said $2.5 billion this year from gate-all-around and more than double that in -- did I hear that wrong? Does that suggest $5 billion in gate-all-around in 2025? Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's what --Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Did I misunderstand what you said? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, I think that math is correct.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's right, Stacy. So, that's not just the increment. That's the entire equipment sales that we'll have for that technology. So, $2.5 billion for this year and the opportunity to double that next year.Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, guys. OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. Mark Lipacis -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a question for Gary. Gary, when you talk about like investing more in materials engineering, it seems like you're kind of climbing up the value chain to the place where it used to be your customers' domain. And a lot of times when you see companies moving up the value chain and adding more value, ultimately, you see that reflected in improving margins. So, appreciate that you engage in partnerships and that's the spirit. But like if you're adding more value, it seems like that ultimately, at the end of the day, should come back to you in higher profitability. And I'm wondering if you could just talk philosophically about that. Is that something you would expect to see happen? Or does that manifest in other ways? Thank you. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, if you look at the industry overall, all of our customers are racing to be first to market to deliver those major device architecture inflections that determine their competitive position. So, gate-all-around, backside power, those new DRAM architectures and packaging is becoming more and more important to power performance and costs. So, that is really what shapes the competitive landscape in the industry. And it's very, very clear. We're working with our customers for technology generations out into the future. So, we have very high visibility, and this broad and connected portfolio that we have gives us an opportunity to engage with customers in those early and very deep relationships on those architectural inflections. And as we look forward, we do see materials engineering as a percentage of spend and the relative contribution increasing. And Applied has clear leadership, especially with this broad, connected portfolio. We built integration capability inside Applied that is really tremendous and really co-innovating with our customers as they're driving those architecture inflections. So, I do believe, for sure, that we will be creating more value in those relationships with our customers, and that certainly is valuable for them. And our focus is to capture more value as we're delivering more value with them. So, your basic question, I agree with your thoughts.Mark Lipacis -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thanks, very helpful.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. Gary, maybe back to the gate-all-around. So, you're raising the forecast there by $1 billion. I think on, I think, HBM, you're raising it by another $100 million or so. Is that all going to show up in July and October? So, does it mean that conceptually, the second half of the year is over $1 billion higher than what you thought before? And then on gate-all-around, what is driving such a significant growth versus what you thought before? $1 billion increase over $1.5 billion base is a very strong number. So, I'm just curious, what are the kind of the qualitative factors? And then just also quantitatively, does it mean that second half is $1.1 billion higher than what you thought before?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Vivek, it's Brice. I'll just do a clarification here. We decided last quarter when we talked about the incremental revenue for gate-all-around that it was a little bit confusing. So, we changed -- in this quarter, we're talking about all of our revenue that's associated with the gate-all-around transistor and wiring. And so, that's not just the increment. So, the $2.5 billion that we're talking about this quarter is not supposed to be interpreted as an increase relative to the $1 billion we talked about last quarter. We're just changing the basis. Now we're just quoting all of the business that's associated with the gate-all-around product. So, hopefully, that helps. So, as far as answering the question about what's driving the increase, I don't think our perspective has changed very much. It's $2.5 billion for this year. It can grow significantly next year as the technology ramps. And then what I would say is you do see some of that in our Q3 guide. So, as you know, we took down -- or we're dropping off the incremental China DRAM shipments that we had. And in the second half, we're filling that in with ICAPS strength and growing leading logic shipments that are driven by gate-all-around. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Vivek, let me add, relative to kind of what drives the incremental spending, these technologies where you're improving device performance to drive current, leakage, power consumption, all of those things, are incredibly difficult. And so, the customers -- and it's really all about this materials magic that we're able to provide with that broad portfolio of different types of technologies. So, step counts are increasing at every one of those different technology nodes as they are driving those road maps for performance power to meet the -- especially for high-performance computing, AI computing demand type of applications. So, again, those are very, very, very difficult technologies. Whether it's 100 billion transistors in a GPU or 100 kilometers of wiring in an applications processor, those are really amazing, amazing technology accomplishments with materials. That's what drives that incremental spending. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Yes, thank you. Good evening. The question is on advanced packaging. And you were pretty specific with what you're expecting this year. You spoke about the opportunity to double that again. You didn't provide a time frame on that. So, if you could help us with some of the time frame on when you expect to double that? And just in terms of what's driving that, we know there's advanced packaging in logic and HBM. What's the mix of that in terms of what's driving the expectations higher? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Chris, this is Gary. So, the whole focus around advanced packaging heterogeneous integration is really a major drive across the entire industry. When you look at AI servers or any of these different kinds of applications, you see tremendous innovation in the high-bandwidth memory. You see tremendous innovation in how you're connecting together all of those high-performance logic chips and memory chips. And we really see the growth there being very, very significant because it's so important to the industry's road map as kind of classic Moore's Law has slowed down significantly. This is another major driver of how the industry will innovate going forward. And with Applied, we have the broadest portfolio of technologies, PVD, CVD, CMP plating, etch. We've added hybrid bonding, digital lithography, eBeam test. We have a very broad portfolio. And as we see those road maps -- and this is why I come back to architecture inflections are really what drives your incremental business going forward. So, we can see the road maps for our foundry/logic customers, for memory customers. All of them are investing very heavily in these types of technologies. And some of these areas also that are new innovations from Applied will help us drive that business two times higher. And I think that the compound annual growth rate keeps going up from there. The other advantage that we have besides this broad portfolio in the deep, multi-generation connection that we have with all of our customers is our full-flow packaging lab in Singapore. We're working with leading customers on those next-generation innovations, Chris. So, we have a pretty good line of sight to what those inflections look like, the architecture inflections will look like in a very strong position to grow our share as those inflections come to market. We're not giving a specific time frame on the doubling. It will happen over a number of years. But very, very optimistic about our opportunities in packaging.Chris Caso -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please. Srini Pajjuri -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thank you. Brice, I have a question on China. I think last quarter, you said you expect China to normalize to about 30% or so by the end of this year. So, my question is, is that still the expectation? And then it looks like ICAPS is still holding up pretty well. So, is the decline primarily DRAM going forward? And I'm just curious as to given what we are hearing about what we're seeing in the end markets of ICAPS, I mean it looks like the broader analog is still relatively weak and auto is kind of mixed. I'm just curious as to what's driving the strength in ICAPS. Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thanks, Srini. Yes, first of all, our mix as we move to the second half of the year will normalize with respect to China as a percent of our total revenue. So, it will be closer to 30% as expected. And it's the dynamic that you highlighted. We had some catch-up DRAM shipments to particular customers in China for the last three quarters. Those will fall off as we go through Q3 and Q4, and that really will bring our percentage of China revenue back down closer to what's average over the last few years, which we'll call about 30%. And then with respect to the mix of business. So, as that DRAM business falls off, our ICAPS business and our leading-edge logic business does increase to fill that in. And so, that's consistent with continued strength in ICAPS, which the rest of the market for us in China would be ICAPS-related. And I think you described it well. The end markets are mixed. So, industrial and auto have been weaker. Smartphone, PC-related products have been slow but gaining some strength recently. And then as we've talked about image sensors, power chips, micro-controllers, a lot of those markets have been stronger. So, it's been mixed end markets, but the customers are investing for forward-looking demand and to get capacity in place for forward-looking demand. And when we see utilization in those markets, we've seen it improve. So, I think when people ask us for guidance, hopefully, the best thing we can tell you is Q1 and Q2 were very strong in ICAPS, and Q3 will be another strong quarter in the ICAPS market. Thanks for the question.Srini Pajjuri -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thanks, Brice.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please. Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on gate-all-around as well. Very strong outlook, $2.5 billion, doubling to next year. Is the customer funnel for this demand pretty broad across the four foundries? And also if you can rank order for us in the $2.5 billion FE, ALD, patterning. What's driving the most demand? Thank you.Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer I'll take the first part. I think that demand is across our customer base. So, it's not one single customer, but we won't share any details about the relative balance between customers. And then from a device mix perspective, Gary -- or I'm sorry, equipment mix, I don't know if there's anything you would highlight there. Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think again, one of the advantages that we have is this broad portfolio of technologies along with integrated tools and also our integration engineering, where we're working with customers, they're really co-innovating on these different technology inflections. So, if you look at gate-all-around, we have FE, PVD, ALD, selective removal etch, thermal processing, implant, CMP and eBeam. So, it's a very broad -- a broad portfolio. And I'm not going to break out all of those different pieces. But what I would say is our ability to connect that portfolio together is really a tremendous strength in our ability to co-optimize as you're thinking about -- and we've done this back in FinFET also, where we were able to co-optimize and innovate in how you're building those structures so that you can improve power and performance. And we're doing the same thing with gate-all-around.OperatorDoes that answer your question?Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Yes, thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two quick ones, one on HBM and the other one on NAND. So, in HBM, your customers would tell us that they're sold out, certainly for '24. For the most part, they're sold out for '25 as well. So, my guess is you've got pretty good visibility into next year. Gary, you talked about overall advanced packaging doubling over the medium to long term. But when you zoom into HBM, could that business for you multiply again in '25 on a year-over-year basis? And then on the NAND side, the business continues to be pretty depressed. Your customers, their profitability is improving. Cash flow is improving or becoming less bad. Are you starting to see purchase orders from your customers come back? Or what do they need to see for them to spend on WFE again? Thank you. Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll start and then Gary may add something on the HBM. So, on the sold-out comment, what we do -- we have seen utilizations improve across the DRAM wafer starts. We've seen the allocation to HBM from a wafer start perspective increase from 5% to probably something closer to 20%. That said, it's not 100% utilized. So, you could speculate what the -- if there's some restraints, it could be in the packaging side, and we have seen orders for HBM going up. So, we'll have to let you think about that and talk to those vendors from that perspective. On the NAND side, our perspective on NAND is that Moore's Law is still very much alive in NAND. The bit density is increasing with each generation of NAND fairly aggressively, and it's meeting the demand function for increased bits. And what that really means is that the business we see in NAND is for technology upgrades, more technology upgrades, not really new wafer starts. So, that's what we expect to see as we move forward. And overall, we expect NAND to grow at the speed of semiconductors. Obviously, storage has a very important part, and several of the vendors called out how important storage is even for AI and that it will grow. So, I think for us, it's been slow, but we expect it to grow over time and memory in total to be about a third of our sales for WFE. And then, Gary, back to you whether anything specific on HBM.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Really, Toshiya, nothing really too much more beyond what Brice was talking about. And we have seen the demand for HBM strengthening. We went from about 4x increase to 6x increase from the last time that we talked to you guys. And I would say that we still are seeing incremental demand going forward. So, that pull is still there from customers. We're not giving any point estimate for next year, but we do continue to see stronger demand in that segment.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please. Krish Sankar -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on backside power delivery. It seems that the industry has two approaches to it. One is the backside wiring with direct contact with the transistors. Another once is the nano-TFE approach. I'm kind of curious. You've spoken about the incremental $1 billion SAM for 100,000 wafer starts per month. How does it split between those two approaches? And also, can you quantify what kind of revenues you expect this year and next year for Applied in backside power deliveries? Thank you.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Krish, yeah, I don't want to talk too much about the specific architectures that customers are using. That's confidential for all of those different customers. I would say that going forward, that direct connect to the backside is the path that everybody is focused on. So, I think over time, that will grow a fairly significant amount -- well, both of those approaches will grow a fairly significant amount. And we're deeply engaged with customers on that inflection. We're leading in wiring overall. We have a very, very high share of wiring. And so, wiring going to the backside, we've said that, that gives us an opportunity of 50% of that spend when that inflection happens. So, we're supporting both of those different types of approaches for the backside, but I don't want to get too specific in terms of which one do we see bigger over time. I think that it could move to the direct connect. But that timing, I don't want to give specifically because that's going to be each one of different customers' road maps. Relative to timing for revenue, it's pretty small for us right now in 2024. It will grow in '25, but the significant ramp for backside power is still out beyond '25 in revenue.Krish Sankar -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Thanks, Gary.Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please. Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks a lot, Brice, I had a 2-part question on China DRAM. And the first part is you talked about it coming down $500 million. Is that stepping all the way down in fiscal Q3? So, what's the assumed step-down in China DRAM for fiscal Q3? And then more broadly, of the $1.6 billion worth of DRAM business, I'm wondering if you can kind of help us figure out how much of that is China. If I look at Korea and I look at how much that did, it looks like about $1 billion of the $1.6 billion DRAM revenue is China. Can you confirm whether that's in the right ballpark? Thanks. Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Tim, thanks for the question. The only quantification that I gave in prior quarters was that our DRAM as a whole was up more than $500 million in the quarters where we had that incremental. So, I think I'll just leave it at that and say it's more than $500 million in each of the last three quarters. And as we look into the second half, it doesn't drop completely to 0 in Q3, but it drops significantly, and then it's pretty close to zero in Q4. And our mix to China revenue for the company, as I highlighted to an earlier question, will be about in the range of 30%, which is normal for us. So, I think that's as close as I can get on that. Thanks for the question.Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst Sure, Bryce, thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of try to understand just the trends that you're seeing in ICAPS. Can you help us just understand the difference in the growth that you're seeing from China versus non-China? Because it sounds like as we look at China revenue normalizing, the DRAM falling off, obviously, the rest of that is mostly just ICAPS. So, can you help us just kind of understand the trends between China and non-China?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Joe, thanks for the question. Yes, for China, what I would say is the last three quarters have been very strong. So, if we're speculating about a slowdown or a digestion period, one of the reasons I didn't reemphasize that is we're kind of going by what we're seeing. So, we had two strong quarters, Q1, Q2. Our Q3 guide again has strength in ICAPS and a strong fourth quarter for China. When we think about the world right now, I think we have three regions growing and the rest of the regions not growing. So, that corresponds with the end markets sort of being mixed at this point. Our view of China overall, the team showed a pie chart of the different device elements of WFE last year. ICAPS was about 40% of WFE by that pie chart on May 2nd that was put out. China is our largest market in ICAPS, and we monitor that carefully. We've got a large number of customers. We're tracking about 30 different -- more than 30 factory projects that are in ramp process. In other words, they have capacity. They're adding capacity. They're ramping. We're tracking utilizations. Utilizations are improving. We understand yields are improving. So, we think that the China market will be a very large and important market for us going forward. We said we don't see a cliff for that market, and I think we'd stick by all those remarks at this point.Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As we transition from a more mature specialty ICAPS-driven growth profile to a leading edge, sort of advanced foundry/logic memory spending profile this year and going forward, this typically tends to be a strong tailwind for your process control and diagnostics portfolio, which leans very heavily on your most advanced tools and solutions, right? Because picture sizes get smaller, so better resolution required, but also new and more defecting yield challenges, right? So, it's probably a driver of your leading-edge CFE-driven eBeam portfolio this year. Are you guys still seeing that portfolio grow like 4x this year? And how does the pipeline look for next year? And maybe mid- to longer term, like given the significant manufacturability challenges, does the Applied team see process control and diagnostics intensity rising faster than overall WFE intensity over the next few years? Gary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Harlan. This is Gary. So, I would say that for sure, the connection that we have with our eBeam technology and these major architecture inflections is a real advantage for us because, again, it's a race on who gets there first relative to those major architecture inflections and learning rate. How fast you learn is one of the determining factors. So, having this unique capability is a real advantage for Applied. I mean obviously, it's a good growth driver for us from a revenue perspective. But that synergy with the rest of our broad portfolio, our connected portfolio, is a real advantage. On cold field emission, which is really one of the key technologies in the electron optics, it gives us the highest resolution, adds up to 10x higher imaging speeds. So, it really is highly differentiated. And we are still on track this year to grow our CFE systems revenue around 4x in '24, and that would represent about 50% of our total eBeam system sales. And then when I look forward, again, I see PDC as a really great growth driver for Applied. We've had the strongest pipeline of new products than we've ever had. And the synergy with the rest of our process equipment business, all of that materials magic, materials innovation is increasing. So, again, very, very optimistic about the shape of that business.Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thank you, Gary.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President Yeah, thanks, Harlan. And operator, we have time for just one more quick question, please.OperatorCertainly. One moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please. Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Yes, sir. Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Gary, you were talking about this inflection point technology, leading-edge logic, HBM, DRAM, and advanced packaging. But would it be fair to say that what is not in your backlog is the additional wafer capacity, especially for gate-all-around and memory, and that would be something that would be coming in, the POs be placed later this year for shipment in 2025?Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Mehdi, it's Brice. I guess I'll take that one. We do expect -- I can't tell if it's a greenfield question or not, but we do expect increased wafer starts across definitely ICAPS, definitely leading logic, a smaller amount in DRAM. And probably the place where we don't really expect increased wafer starts is in NAND, but that will still be upgrades. So, most of the memory technologies are upgrades. But it will be a combination of new technologies and new plant and equipment across the board.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Thank you.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President OK. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And now, Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts? Brice Hill -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mike. I think we've done a good job anticipating the road map inflections in data center AI. We can see the pull for our solutions in gate-all-around chips, from transistors to frontside wiring and backside wiring and in advanced packaging. Same goes for DRAM, where we're No. 1 in materials engineering and especially strong in HBM stacking. In future calls, we'll have a lot more to say about our positions in edge, AI and IoT plus automotive, and clean energy, which are very big and long-term drivers of our ICAPS business. The momentum in our systems business fuels our service business, which is driving very stable subscription-like growth and helping us increase the dividend at an accelerated rate. Gary will be at the Bernstein Conference in New York on May 30th, and I hope to see many of you at the BofA conference in San Francisco on June 6th. Thank you, Mike. Let's close the call.Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice President OK. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Mike Sullivan -- Corporate Vice PresidentGary Dickerson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerBrice Hill -- Chief Financial OfficerC.J.

      "DXC Technology (DXC -16.90%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorHello, and welcome to the DXC Technology Q4 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Sweeney, vice president, investor relations. You may begin.John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased that you're joining us for the DXC Technology's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Our speakers on the call today will be Raul Fernandez, president and CEO; and Rob Del Bene, our EVP and CFO. The call is being webcast at DXC Investor Relations website, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today. Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.These statements are subject to known risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC's president and CEO, Raul Fernandez. Raul? Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. I will give a brief introduction, review our financial performance, update you on the progress we are making with our offerings, then Rob will take us through the fourth quarter financial results and discuss our fiscal year '25 guidance. I will also make some final remarks before opening the call up for questions. In Q4 of fiscal year '24, total revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis, above our expectation; adjusted EBIT margin of 8.4%, down 50 basis points year over year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 was also above our guidance range. Free cash flow equaled $155 million for a total of $756 million for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that DXC has achieved free cash flow of more than $700 million. While we met or beat expectations in Q4, we know we can operate at a higher level and are not satisfied with the current state. In my five-month tenure, I have met with more than three dozen customers globally, along with thousands of our employees in small and large settings, in-person and virtual. I've engaged with dozens of investors and have successfully recruited very strong, experienced executives to join our team. I believe we have a global team that is reenergized to make the company better and more effective. I've also gotten a deeper understanding of all of our business units, so let me quickly recap a few thoughts, starting with Insurance. DXC is the largest provider of insurance software and insurance business process services globally from origination to claims processing. We are the category leader providing software and services in three out of four insurance segments: life and wealth, global specialty, and reinsurance. As an example, our technology and services process one in five property and casualty transactions worldwide. Our global customer base includes 21 of the top 25 global insurance carriers. In short, we are a key strategic technology partner, supporting global insurance companies with their customers, their agents, and their employees. The strong recurring and reoccurring revenue, coupled with 90-plus percent customer retention and an average customer tenure of 18 years, makes this a very interesting business unit for me to focus on. As Rob will comment, the insurance software and services business, representing approximately three-fourths of the total insurance revenue, grew at a very respectable 4.5% in the quarter. It's an incredibly strong foundation to build on and continue to grow and also to rotate our revenue mix more toward SaaS and reoccurring services. So, we are actively working on a focused plan to further accelerate the growth of this business unit and also highlight the value of its leadership role in the industry and its mix of software and reoccurring services. Continuing with GBS, we're bringing together the best capabilities of our Analytics and Engineering and Applications business, now called Consulting and Engineering Services, with industry veteran Howard Boville as our general manager. Our Consulting and Engineering Services business has a rich and extensive history of driving transformative change for some of the world's biggest brands. In financial services, we provide core banking solutions to numerous banks globally. Within automotive and manufacturing, we are deeply involved in their digital transformation. We enable major auto brands to operate their research and development efforts for autonomous driving on our platform, enabling the ingestion and analysis of large data sets. We have built and run in-car infotainment systems across most of the luxury brands. While our technology solutions and operations are critical for our customers, our execution is below average, and we are focused on improving the profitability of our Consulting and Engineering Services business unit. Moving on to security. A key thing to note about our security business is that it is an enabler of many of our other services. Customers in our ITO and Modern Workplace rely on us to provide services in a secure, resilient way. Our security teams embed themselves in those offerings to do that in cooperation with our clients. We have over 3,000 security professionals operating across eight global security operations centers where we provide around-the-clock coverage for our customers. As cyber threats increase by the day, not a week goes by that our teams are not called in to assist companies dealing with a security incident. The pace and complexity of these attacks are growing as the regulatory requirements for companies dealing with them. Our focus in the security business is to continue to leverage our expertise to enhance our GBS and GIS offerings while also focusing on accelerating growth of our stand-alone services. With the recent addition of several industry veterans, we expect to enable that growth. Moving on to Cloud and ITO. For our Cloud and ITO offering, we provide business and mission-critical services for some of the world's most essential workloads. As I have spent time in the business, I meet more and more customers who reiterate how critical our work is. Many of the world's largest airlines, energy companies, financial institutions, along with government organizations, count on DXC for the systems at the heart of their business. Our teams around the globe work 24/7 to keep their operations running seamlessly and securely. This is a core competency of the company. We operate across the entire technology domain from legacy core mainframes all the way through the most cutting-edge serverless cloud environments on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. As our customers modernize their estates, moving on to more cloud and modern architecture, often with the help of our GBS business unit, we are well positioned to help them securely operate across multiple environments. This is the foundation we are building on as we pivot our focus of this business to high-quality, profitable, cash-generating service revenue and away from the heavy hardware, software, and data center outsourcing style deals of the past, which drove higher revenue at the expense of profit. Continuing with Modern Workplace. We support over 7 million devices and employees all day every day. The employee experience is more mission-critical than ever. Today, we operate services with a combination of human and nonhuman workforce globally and at scale. Driven by AI, we believe we will reach a point soon where at least 75% of our workforce capacity is nonhuman. We are building and demonstrating expertise in how to manage the nonhuman workforce at this scale. In dialogue across our customer base, the message is clear, embracing AI technology is a central part of their digital strategy going forward, and we are well-positioned to lead this. As I mentioned before, and it's even more clear to me now, there were missed opportunities in the past to rationalize systems, processes, legal entities, go-to-market, and delivery functions. Therefore, to strengthen our market position, we are undertaking a restructuring initiative aimed at simplifying and enhancing our operational efficiency. We will simplify our processes, increase visibility to eliminate redundancies, reduce costs, improve resource management, and ultimately drive a more streamlined, agile, and competitive organization. One specific example of this enterprise initiative is consolidating our five acquired enterprise business systems and optimizing our back-end office functions. We anticipate not only a material reduction in our operating costs but also improvements in our service delivery and responsiveness to our customers. We are also aligning our organizational structure to support streamlined operations with improved and faster decision-making. This realignment will make us more competitive. Now, Rob will walk you through the financials.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Raul, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter financial results and then provide you with our outlook for the full year and for the first quarter of fiscal '25. Total organic revenue growth declined 4.9% year to year, ahead of our fourth-quarter guidance. GBS revenue was nearly flat, while GIS top line declined 9.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.4%, above the top end of our guidance, representing an 80-basis-point improvement sequentially, driven by our cost reduction initiatives. Margin was down 50 basis points year to year, primarily driven by lower noncash pension income and the impact of gains from asset sales booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.97, down $0.05 from last year's fourth quarter. The year-to-year change was driven by a negative $0.13 adjusted EBIT impact, higher taxes of $0.08, and a noncontrolling interest impact of $0.03. These reductions were partially offset by a $0.19 benefit from our share repurchase program. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, for the quarter equaled $155 million compared to our expectation of about $200 million. The shortfall was due to a combination of a smaller benefit from working capital and higher-than-anticipated cash tax levels. For the year, our free cash flow totaled $756 million, which was the third straight year above $700 million, demonstrating consistency of cash generation performance. And now I'll turn to our fourth-quarter key financial metrics. Gross margin equaled 23.6%, flat year to year as we continued to drive workforce optimization and reduce our real estate footprint in the face of declining revenue. SG&A was 8.7% of revenue, down 70 basis points year to year, largely driven by ongoing spending management and a $10 million nonrecurring insurance reimbursement. Depreciation and amortization was flat year to year as a percent of revenue, down $17 million, reflecting continued capital discipline. Other income for the quarter was $39 million, a year-to-year reduction of $48 million, which is a 120-basis-point impact to EBIT margin, driven by lower pension income of $26 million and lower gains on asset sales of $19 million. Now, turning to our segment results. For GBS, organic revenue performance was nearly flat year to year, with the deceleration largely driven by the ongoing challenging market environment for Analytics and Engineering and Applications. GBS profit margin equaled 13.3%, down 40 basis points year to year but up 140 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a more favorable mix of higher-margin services revenue. For GIS, organic revenue declined 9.3%, largely consistent with our performance throughout the year. We have taken a very disciplined financial approach with new deals and renewals, and this has been reflected in our bookings and revenue performance of both Cloud and ITO and Modern Workplace. GIS margins declined 40 basis points year to year, with operational improvements more than offset by a lower level of pension income. Let me now provide some detail on our individual offerings, first in GBS. Both Analytics and Engineering and Applications organic revenue declined 1% year to year as performance continues to be impacted by the current challenging market environment. While the revenue declined, the book-to-bill ratios for these two businesses were 1.0 or better, with strong renewal activity that does not provide incremental short-term revenue but provides longer-term revenue stability. Insurance organic revenue increased 1% year to year. Embedded in this performance is our insurance software and services business, which represents approximately three-quarters of the total, that continued its strong momentum, up 4.5% in the quarter. Normalizing for a significant large perpetual license sale in the fourth quarter of last year, the insurance software and services business grew approximately 9% year to year. The insurance book-to-bill was 0.8x. As a reminder, bookings in this business can vary significantly quarter to quarter based on the timing of large renewals. For example, last quarter, we had two significant renewals, and our book-to-bill was 1.58. Now, moving to our GIS segment. Security declined 9% year over year on an organic basis with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96. Cloud infrastructure and IT outsourcing organic revenue declined 7%, an improvement from double-digit declines we saw in the prior three quarters due to a significant resale transaction delivered in the quarter. The book-to-bill was 0.75x, a result of the ongoing challenging ITO market and our selective approach to new deals. Modern Workplace organic revenue declined year to year in the mid-teens impacted by resale revenue, which was down 30%. Book-to-bill performance this quarter was a strong 1.29x due to several large renewals. Now, turning to our financial foundation. We sequentially reduced our total debt levels by $450 million, and for the full year, our total debt levels have been reduced by $300 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $20 million, up $3 million year to year, reflecting the higher interest rate environment on our short-term borrowings. Restructuring and TSI expense was $21 million, and for the full year, it was $118 million, about half of the level spent in fiscal '23. Operating lease payments of $84 million were down $9 million year to year due to the management of our real estate footprint. The fourth quarter capital expenditures were $125 million and lease originations were $21 million. Our finance lease and asset financing payments continue to trend down, and as a percentage of revenue, capital expenditures and lease originations declined to 4.3%, down more than one point year over year, representing a multiyear low. Turning to capital deployment. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $450 million of cash to reduce our debt levels. We accomplished this by retiring our outstanding balance of commercial paper and continuing to decrease our lease portfolio. We returned $138 million of capital to shareholders, repurchasing 6.2 million shares at a weighted average price per share of $22.30. For the full year, we repurchased over 18% of our shares outstanding at a total cost of $883 million. Since the beginning of the fiscal year '22, we have reduced our share count by more than 30%. As we enter a new fiscal year, I would like to provide clarity on our updated financial priorities. Our plan is to deploy our capital to accomplish two things. First, given our recent revenue performance, we will execute a restructuring program to address excess capacity, largely concentrated in GIS, and rightsize our infrastructure throughout the company to improve profitability. The second priority is to further reduce debt levels, including significantly minimizing finance lease originations. Now, turning to our full year '25 guidance. We expect our total organic revenue to decline 4% to 6%. In GBS, we expect our full-year outlook to be slightly positive, with the first half performance in line with our fourth quarter of fiscal '24 and with a return to growth in the second half of the year. In GIS, given last year's bookings and the resulting impact to opening backlog, combined with continued expected lower resale revenue and deal selectivity in fiscal '25, we anticipate full-year organic revenue to decline in the low double-digit range. Our guidance for adjusted EBIT margin is 6% to 7%. This guidance primarily reflects the impact from lower year-to-year revenue and investments we're making in the business to drive productivity improvements. Additionally, we will be executing on the previously mentioned restructuring action to improve margins on a sustainable basis going forward, with the impact of the savings largely materializing in late fiscal '25 and into fiscal '26. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we continue to rationalize our real estate portfolio. These potential sales will provide a cash inflow outside of free cash flow but will have a negative impact on our adjusted EBIT margin. The potential loss on these sales is not included in the guidance as the market remains difficult and the timing is uncertain. And with this expected adjusted EBIT margin levels, our full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance is $2.50 to $3 with an assumed non-GAAP effective tax rate of 30%. Our free cash flow guidance for fiscal '25 is about $400 million. There are two main drivers contributing to the lower year-over-year level, and without these changes, free cash flow would be at levels consistent with fiscal '24 performance. As I previously mentioned, we will be reducing our debt levels in fiscal '25, and a component of our debt reduction strategy is significantly reducing finance lease originations, which were $185 million in fiscal '24. This change in funding approach will reduce our overall debt levels but will increase our capital expenditures, impacting free cash flow. Also impacting free cash flow will be spending related to the increased level of restructuring, which will be an increase of approximately $250 million year to year. Our expectation is that the restructuring savings will put us on a sustainable path of free cash flow generation above fiscal '24 levels in fiscal '26. As a reminder, our Q1 free cash flow is seasonally lowest primarily due to the timing of bonus payouts and certain annual supplier payments. Consistent with prior years, cash flow generation will be strongest in the second half of the year. And now, our first quarter outlook. In GBS, we anticipate that revenue performance in A&E and Applications will continue to reflect the current challenging market environment. And in GIS, services revenue will decline in the mid- to high single-digit range, with resale taking the GIS decline to double digits. With these factors, we expect total company organic revenue to decline 7% to 8%. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margins in the range of 5.5% to 6%, a function of the lower revenue and first-quarter seasonality, which has consistently impacted our results in prior years. And finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 to $0.60. With that, let me turn the call back over to Raul for key takeaways.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Rob. There is quite a lot to do to operate at a higher level. That's why I'm so happy with the additions to our executive team in the last 60 days. They are all industry veterans with proven track records. We will define success by continuing to perform better every quarter while we transform as quickly as possible. Thank you for attending the call. Operator, we're going to open it up for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Raul, maybe you could just help us understand how your restructuring might be different than many of the CEOs that came before you that had a lot of restructuring as well. It seems like every five years or so, a CEO comes in, looks at the business, and restructures it. Just trying to get a sense of how maybe your plans might look different than what we've seen over the last few decades at CSC and now DXC.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. OK. Great question. Thank you. I know that, as you've mentioned, in the short history of this public company, there have been previous restructurings. But as someone who just got here and have really spent a lot of time operationally looking at our systems, our processes, our entities, our distribution of head count, it's clear to me that the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth. You can look at that in multiple ways: number of systems still in place that were acquired over time, never integrated, never deduped; number of business processes that got stacked on top of each other; number of legal entities. I think anyone that came in would look at the previous work, and again, I know the history is there so I'm not running away from it, but I can tell you that this is a real reset. It is bottoms up. It is a strong foundation to go from and it is absolutely needed because otherwise, we just continue to carry a really not fully functional organization that can take advantage of the opportunities that we have.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then just as a follow-up, any of the restructuring charges, are those through the P&L, so they're in the margin targets that we're looking at? Or are those outside those targets? And then secondly to that, just on GBS, a little bit of a recovery, I think you talked about in the second half of the year. What gives you confidence in that GBS recovery for positive organic growth in the second half? Thanks.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Bryan, this is Rob Del Bene. Thanks for the question. First, on restructuring, restructuring is not included. Consistent with the approach taken since the beginning of the company, restructuring is not included in the adjusted EBIT margin. It obviously is included in the free cash flow numbers. So, that's the answer to your first question. On the GBS first half to second half dynamic, with a difficult marketplace, we do see the first half of the year performance similar to the back half of fiscal '24. We have some encouragement. Our pipelines have been improving, and our conversion rates are consistent. So, with that improved pipeline and conversion rates, we see us going from low single-digit negatives to low single-digit positives in the second half of the year.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer And it's all built on, again, new leadership there, new life cycle management in terms of opportunities. So, pre-proposal, proposal, pitching smarter, better, faster, and also eliminating, frankly, some self-inflicted delivery issues that we have had and, in some cases, we're still working our way out of. As I've mentioned before, this isn't one lever. This is a lot of little levers. And I think one of the things that has given me additional encouragement that I'm looking at it correctly and the team is looking at it correctly is that, as we've brought on great new experienced executives from great companies that have been succeeding in the marketplace all over the world, they have confirmed that it's a very opportunity-rich environment, meaning we have a lot of things that we can be doing better. And if we do those things better, again, not rocket science, operational excellence, and I'd say, in some cases, just getting to average, that will show up top line and bottom line and conversion and show up in gross margins, net margins, etc. So, I feel like we've got a way to go to get to a base and then from that base, we're going to continue to grow off of it. But I think we've got the right people, the right structure, and now the right go-to-market model and incentives, and I'm encouraged.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Great. I'll pass the line. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks so much for going through all this. I'm just curious on the bookings side, how that came in versus plan in a little bit more detail, and what we might expect as the fiscal year plays out here in terms of replenish either new logo or renewal.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, Tien-Tsin, thanks. So, the bookings relative to the last forecast we gave 90 days ago were pretty consistent and actually a little better in GBS. And that was really, really due to renewals in A&E were strong and it's the second quarter in a row they've been strong. And in my remarks, I mentioned that those renewals, they don't translate into revenue growth in the first half of the year, but they do provide a solid foundation for the second half. So, we did a little better than anticipated. We did as expected in GIS. And going into fiscal '25, we expect a very similar picture where we have strong renewal activity in both GBS and GIS and then new content and, based on the pipeline, new content in GBS filtering in throughout and improving throughout the year in fiscal '25.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you for that. And then maybe, Raul, just quickly, my quick follow-up, just with the additions to the management team. I know you're bringing some people in from familiar places. Are you done with some of the additions? Do you expect some other turnover or maybe new roles that should expand into the management team? Just curious what your thinking is there. Thank you.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And look, you've seen some of the releases, right? So, we've obviously announced some publicly, and then there are others that we didn't announce but they've joined the team across the organization. I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of great executives over my 25-plus years in technology. And in that journey, we've had the opportunity to work together, and many of the executives that have come here, we've had the opportunity to compete together, work together, and win together. So, yes, we got a few more that are coming. But in terms of looking at the people that we need to execute, building on top of the team that's here, the great team that's here, and adding some great executives that are fit for the roles where we need an additional horsepower, I feel like I've gotten the team 90-plus percent in place.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Good to know. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thank you. First question just on free cash flow. So, understanding you have, I believe, the $250 million restructuring headwind that seems to be the biggest chunk in the year-over-year bridge, but can you talk about otherwise maybe the levers for free cash flow sustainability amid ongoing top line and potentially margin pressure? And can you also talk about maybe the annual outflows associated with capital lease payments going forward, too, after free cash flow?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, in terms of free cash flow, we start from a base of strength three years in a row, over $700 million, $750 million in fiscal '24. And we have that solid base moving into fiscal '25. And as I mentioned, the two impacts to that number are the increase in restructuring of $250 million and then the curtailment or significantly curtailing new lease originations, which does shift the spend over to capex, impacting our free cash flow number in the year. Now, we do have operating leverage with working capital. So, there is room for improvement in working capital. We're going to be taking advantage of that in fiscal '25 and beyond. And again, the purpose of the restructuring is to shore up EBIT moving forward, '25 into fiscal '26, and curtail that headwind that we faced for the last couple of years. So, that's the plan. In terms of cap lease payments, we're in the low 200s, and that will continue to wind down. In '26, it will go from a $200 million range to a $100 million range and then down from there. John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations And just to foot-stomp this, the lease originations will go from $185 million in FY '24 to zero in '25.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So, a very small number.John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations And that's a $185 million reduction in the free cash flow.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, John.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. That's very helpful. OK. And I guess a follow-up, just as we think about the top line, the '25 guide, as we try to unpack some of the factors you considered here as it relates to kind of revenue retention and whether you're also working to actively prune out any unfavorable basis of business contracts, any pieces of business you're looking at and assessing that's not strategic to the company? Anything that you're working through kind of here to be mindful of as you build the outlook?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, especially in ITO and Modern Workplace where, historically, there's been the packaging of less-than-optimal profitable reselling of products, reselling of software. That guidance or that direction changed when I got here, and we are going to have profitable contracts, profitable relationships. To the extent we don't have them right now, as we get into renewals of contracts, we're going to address that and then put them on the right footing. But the mandate is clear now that this isn't growth, growth at all costs, growth at a loss, this is growth with real profitability and a real foundation.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And Bryan, just piggybacking on that, we've incorporated that selectivity into our guide on revenue, so that's included, along with continued reduction of low-margin resale. All of that is packed into the GIS element of the guide.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. If I missed it, I apologize. Did you quantify that piece, just so we can kind of parse that out?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Didn't quantify specifically the various elements. But in my opening remarks, I mentioned that we'll be high negative single digits in GIS. And with the resale, it will be negative double digits, low double digits.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. This is Paul Obrecht on for Darrin. Can you just provide some color on what you're seeing in the broader macro environment and client behavior and maybe how that relates to three months ago? And as you built your fiscal year '25 outlook, were you assuming any improvement in the broader demand as we go through the year?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Look, I think there are a couple of factors, right, with companies that are operating at different levels of efficiency. And I think our issue is being more effective across the whole life cycle of capturing business, new business, solutioning it correctly, pricing it correctly, as well as on our existing business, obviously, winning the recompetes and being able to create the right economic model for those recompetes. We have plenty of opportunity in the universe that we operate in. I think from a macro standpoint, I echo what others have said in the space that some discretionary spending is paused and has lightened up. I do think that that is less of a headwind for us than optimizing our go-to-market and sales functions and getting those better. We have our destiny in our hands by being better against the opportunities that we get to compete on, and that will be a bigger factor for us in the near term than the general macro environment.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in Modern Workplace, you could see or you'll reach a point where 75% of the workforce is nonhuman. Can you just touch on the path to get there and what you're doing right now in the business to improve efficiency?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. If you think about a lot of the work there, it's a lot of resolution, small resolution of items across multiple people, humans, devices, countries, companies, etc. If you look at the focus of AI, specifically Copilot and the ability for agents to use large language models, small language models, real precise models, to really proactively and interactively answer and deal with questions, that's the shift where we're going to be using AI in a manner where we can handle the workload, same or more, with a greater infusion of technology and not relying on an increase of humans or people for that. As we transition that, you'll go from a ratio of roughly 40% to 70-plus percent and that's the reference that I made there. But that's real. That's happening. It's actionable. We're experimenting with it across multiple accounts. And the other piece of good news is that the speed of compute behind AI is doubling every six months. So, the speed, accuracy, and multimodal ability for a virtual agent to really be a great partner in delivering these services at a high quality is there today and getting better, and we're going to take full advantage of it.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking our questions. I appreciate the level of detail here. You talked about working through some of the resale dynamics to help profitability. Can you help us understand any other levers you have across contract profitability, whether that's pricing or delivery?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jonathan, I think there's leverage across the board, in particular, in the ITO business. I'll just take that first. We've been on a march to reduce physical capacity with the revenue reductions we've experienced, and we will continue that this year as well. And the $100 million of restructuring between the $250 million year-to-year growth and the base of $350 million, that $100 million is predominantly on physical capacity. So, that's one element that will deliver savings into the future. The second element is just efficiency and infrastructure at the account level, and we are going after that with the restructuring funding. So, while we're very good at our service delivery levels, we've got high NPS scores, our restructuring is designed to eliminate the overhead within the accounts as opposed to the direct delivery population that we have. And still, we're firmly on that track, and that's how we're going to execute the restructuring. In the GBS business, we have room to improve margins. And specifically, in the Consulting and Engineering business, our margins are below competition, and again, the restructuring is designed to help us narrow that gap to competition in that business unit. That's another lever for us.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up, as you think about the realignment of the company on a business unit basis versus geographic prior, can you talk about some of the client receptivity there?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And it's really the intersection, right? Because it's the intersection of the talent, the managers of delivery at the geography in tight coordination with the offering. And so, what you're getting just from the beginning of the life cycle is better pre-bid solutioning, better solutioning, better deployment once you win. One of the things that companies can trip themselves up on, and we certainly have, is not being timely in the staffing or fully staffing of something that's won. That leads to SLAs. That's completely self-inflicted, 100% avoidable. If you plan better, you execute better. So, that's another example of seeing a lot of little things that other organizations can do, and I know we can do better, that can have an impact. And that impact will be every month, every quarter, and we'll see that. So, those are just some of the elements that I think our new go-to-market really resonates with, both the local geography, engaging the offering at a global level, and ultimately, the most important thing, which is the customer. And in my several dozen conversations in the last 150 days and talking through why we think this is a better way of serving our customers, it's been very receptive and very engaging with our customers.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst I appreciate that clarity. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Spencer Anson with Susquehanna. Your line is open.Spencer Anson -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. Raul, you had some relationship callouts on the insurance business. Can you just speak to any broader strategic or even tactical opportunities you see there with the insurance business? Thanks.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Great. Yeah. As I looked at every business unit, I think very early on, it became clear to me that we have an outsized opportunity in terms of a return on effort with our insurance business unit. With that opportunity in hand, we're exploring a small select, and experienced group of partners that could help us accelerate growth with a good SaaS and reoccurring services mix while maintaining control of that business unit. So, we're in that process right now. It's a great foundation. It's a great set of customers, a great history with those customers, and really a critical partnership across the world in every aspect of supporting the different product lines that our customers bring to the marketplace.Spencer Anson -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about go-to-market and sales process. I know, Raul, in past conversations, you talked a lot about improving and tightening up the message to customers so that they understand the value that DXC can deliver, etc. And it sounds like with some of the changes that you've made, that the pipeline is expanding but conversion rates are pretty stable. And it sounds like that's kind of the assumption for right now. But like how should we think about the process and the time to start to even improve conversion rates and how that may be helpful to getting the business back to growth?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think it's a function of the fundamentals, right? The fundamentals that we're operating under in ITO and Modern Workplace, the new leadership and the focus on key vertical solutions, replicability in Consulting and Engineering Services. And also, in talking to customers, if it's an ITO customer or a Modern Workplace, I always come prepared to discuss something relevant in another business unit that they may or may not be aware of. And frankly, it's a good surprise, but I'm surprised that many of our existing customers where we've got tens, in some cases, hundreds of millions of business in one division, do not know and do not appreciate the talent, the experience that another division has. So, just the more effective cross-pollination, cross-sale in existing accounts is something that I see as an opportunity, and it's relatively low-hanging because, again, in my several dozen meetings, I've always tried to say, \"Hey, as you're thinking about this, did you know we did this?\" And most of the time, the answer is, \"Oh no, I didn't know that. Please, let's follow up.\" So, if you scale that and then operationalize that, we're going to be able to get incremental demand from our existing base because in many cases, we've got a great beachhead, a great history, and a great relationship with one offering and a customer, but that should be a gateway, an effective gateway, a fast gateway to compete with the other offerings. And that mechanism, that orchestration, that collaboration, that packaging up of stories, as I've mentioned before, all of that is happening as we speak. And frankly, it wasn't happening at a good level before.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And it sounds like then for the most part, I mean, you've talked about some incremental partnerships, for example, on the insurance side. But it sounds like you feel like you have all the, or at least a majority of assets, to be able to execute and deliver that cross-sell. Is that fair? Or are there other things that you think you're going to need to add into the mix?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. We have what we need to compete. We have what we need to compete profitably and grow. We have to get some internal systems aligned. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, dedupe, streamline, and do some work that should have been done before that wasn't, but we're going to get it done with speed. And we've got to perform every day, every week, every quarter, while we transform and transformation is the restructuring, and we've got to do both quickly.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bradley Clark with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.Bradley Clark -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. This is Brad on for Keith Bachman. I want to ask about your thoughts on GIS and market growth over time. You've alluded to sort of participating in this broader GIS market growth rate, implying perhaps low single-digit decline over time. Is that still how you're thinking about potential growth of both the market and/or GIS longer term given the changes you'll be making to the business?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Bradley, I think that's about right. We have a very realistic view of the market. And our goal is, after rationalizing the portfolio and focusing on exiting unprofitable contracts and being selective, to get to market growth rates, which we see in the low negative single-digit range. So, that's where we're pointing the business in that direction.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer And just to be clear, we're operating at a worse level than that. So, the first goal is to get to \"normal\" or more baseline with other competitors. And once we get there, then obviously the next step is just to find another target and try to meet and beat it. But in the near term, it is to get in line with our competitors with regards to our growth rate, where it is today, and where it should be as a comp.Bradley Clark -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. I appreciate your insight.OperatorThis concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to Raul Fernandez for closing remarks.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate all of the employees that come together every day to deliver great services for our customers and value, all the investors. I definitely also appreciate the sense of frustration and urgency to get things done, and that is what I'm 100% focused on. So, thank you very much for attending today.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor RelationsRaul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive OfficerRob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerBryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystTien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- AnalystBryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- AnalystPaul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystJonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- AnalystSpencer Anson -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystJames Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystBradley Clark -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n",

      "DXC Technology (DXC -16.90%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorHello, and welcome to the DXC Technology Q4 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Sweeney, vice president, investor relations. You may begin.John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased that you're joining us for the DXC Technology's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Our speakers on the call today will be Raul Fernandez, president and CEO; and Rob Del Bene, our EVP and CFO. The call is being webcast at DXC Investor Relations website, and the webcast includes slides that will accompany this discussion today. Today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release and in the webcast slides. Certain comments we make on the call will be forward-looking.These statements are subject to known risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. I'd now like to remind our listeners that DXC Technology assumes no obligation to update the information presented on the call, except as required by law. And with that, I'd like to introduce DXC's president and CEO, Raul Fernandez. Raul? Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. I will give a brief introduction, review our financial performance, update you on the progress we are making with our offerings, then Rob will take us through the fourth quarter financial results and discuss our fiscal year '25 guidance. I will also make some final remarks before opening the call up for questions. In Q4 of fiscal year '24, total revenue declined 5% on a constant currency basis, above our expectation; adjusted EBIT margin of 8.4%, down 50 basis points year over year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 was also above our guidance range. Free cash flow equaled $155 million for a total of $756 million for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that DXC has achieved free cash flow of more than $700 million. While we met or beat expectations in Q4, we know we can operate at a higher level and are not satisfied with the current state. In my five-month tenure, I have met with more than three dozen customers globally, along with thousands of our employees in small and large settings, in-person and virtual. I've engaged with dozens of investors and have successfully recruited very strong, experienced executives to join our team. I believe we have a global team that is reenergized to make the company better and more effective. I've also gotten a deeper understanding of all of our business units, so let me quickly recap a few thoughts, starting with Insurance. DXC is the largest provider of insurance software and insurance business process services globally from origination to claims processing. We are the category leader providing software and services in three out of four insurance segments: life and wealth, global specialty, and reinsurance. As an example, our technology and services process one in five property and casualty transactions worldwide. Our global customer base includes 21 of the top 25 global insurance carriers. In short, we are a key strategic technology partner, supporting global insurance companies with their customers, their agents, and their employees. The strong recurring and reoccurring revenue, coupled with 90-plus percent customer retention and an average customer tenure of 18 years, makes this a very interesting business unit for me to focus on. As Rob will comment, the insurance software and services business, representing approximately three-fourths of the total insurance revenue, grew at a very respectable 4.5% in the quarter. It's an incredibly strong foundation to build on and continue to grow and also to rotate our revenue mix more toward SaaS and reoccurring services. So, we are actively working on a focused plan to further accelerate the growth of this business unit and also highlight the value of its leadership role in the industry and its mix of software and reoccurring services. Continuing with GBS, we're bringing together the best capabilities of our Analytics and Engineering and Applications business, now called Consulting and Engineering Services, with industry veteran Howard Boville as our general manager. Our Consulting and Engineering Services business has a rich and extensive history of driving transformative change for some of the world's biggest brands. In financial services, we provide core banking solutions to numerous banks globally. Within automotive and manufacturing, we are deeply involved in their digital transformation. We enable major auto brands to operate their research and development efforts for autonomous driving on our platform, enabling the ingestion and analysis of large data sets. We have built and run in-car infotainment systems across most of the luxury brands. While our technology solutions and operations are critical for our customers, our execution is below average, and we are focused on improving the profitability of our Consulting and Engineering Services business unit. Moving on to security. A key thing to note about our security business is that it is an enabler of many of our other services. Customers in our ITO and Modern Workplace rely on us to provide services in a secure, resilient way. Our security teams embed themselves in those offerings to do that in cooperation with our clients. We have over 3,000 security professionals operating across eight global security operations centers where we provide around-the-clock coverage for our customers. As cyber threats increase by the day, not a week goes by that our teams are not called in to assist companies dealing with a security incident. The pace and complexity of these attacks are growing as the regulatory requirements for companies dealing with them. Our focus in the security business is to continue to leverage our expertise to enhance our GBS and GIS offerings while also focusing on accelerating growth of our stand-alone services. With the recent addition of several industry veterans, we expect to enable that growth. Moving on to Cloud and ITO. For our Cloud and ITO offering, we provide business and mission-critical services for some of the world's most essential workloads. As I have spent time in the business, I meet more and more customers who reiterate how critical our work is. Many of the world's largest airlines, energy companies, financial institutions, along with government organizations, count on DXC for the systems at the heart of their business. Our teams around the globe work 24/7 to keep their operations running seamlessly and securely. This is a core competency of the company. We operate across the entire technology domain from legacy core mainframes all the way through the most cutting-edge serverless cloud environments on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. As our customers modernize their estates, moving on to more cloud and modern architecture, often with the help of our GBS business unit, we are well positioned to help them securely operate across multiple environments. This is the foundation we are building on as we pivot our focus of this business to high-quality, profitable, cash-generating service revenue and away from the heavy hardware, software, and data center outsourcing style deals of the past, which drove higher revenue at the expense of profit. Continuing with Modern Workplace. We support over 7 million devices and employees all day every day. The employee experience is more mission-critical than ever. Today, we operate services with a combination of human and nonhuman workforce globally and at scale. Driven by AI, we believe we will reach a point soon where at least 75% of our workforce capacity is nonhuman. We are building and demonstrating expertise in how to manage the nonhuman workforce at this scale. In dialogue across our customer base, the message is clear, embracing AI technology is a central part of their digital strategy going forward, and we are well-positioned to lead this. As I mentioned before, and it's even more clear to me now, there were missed opportunities in the past to rationalize systems, processes, legal entities, go-to-market, and delivery functions. Therefore, to strengthen our market position, we are undertaking a restructuring initiative aimed at simplifying and enhancing our operational efficiency. We will simplify our processes, increase visibility to eliminate redundancies, reduce costs, improve resource management, and ultimately drive a more streamlined, agile, and competitive organization. One specific example of this enterprise initiative is consolidating our five acquired enterprise business systems and optimizing our back-end office functions. We anticipate not only a material reduction in our operating costs but also improvements in our service delivery and responsiveness to our customers. We are also aligning our organizational structure to support streamlined operations with improved and faster decision-making. This realignment will make us more competitive. Now, Rob will walk you through the financials.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Raul, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Today, I'll review our fourth quarter financial results and then provide you with our outlook for the full year and for the first quarter of fiscal '25. Total organic revenue growth declined 4.9% year to year, ahead of our fourth-quarter guidance. GBS revenue was nearly flat, while GIS top line declined 9.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin was 8.4%, above the top end of our guidance, representing an 80-basis-point improvement sequentially, driven by our cost reduction initiatives. Margin was down 50 basis points year to year, primarily driven by lower noncash pension income and the impact of gains from asset sales booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.97, down $0.05 from last year's fourth quarter. The year-to-year change was driven by a negative $0.13 adjusted EBIT impact, higher taxes of $0.08, and a noncontrolling interest impact of $0.03. These reductions were partially offset by a $0.19 benefit from our share repurchase program. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, for the quarter equaled $155 million compared to our expectation of about $200 million. The shortfall was due to a combination of a smaller benefit from working capital and higher-than-anticipated cash tax levels. For the year, our free cash flow totaled $756 million, which was the third straight year above $700 million, demonstrating consistency of cash generation performance. And now I'll turn to our fourth-quarter key financial metrics. Gross margin equaled 23.6%, flat year to year as we continued to drive workforce optimization and reduce our real estate footprint in the face of declining revenue. SG&A was 8.7% of revenue, down 70 basis points year to year, largely driven by ongoing spending management and a $10 million nonrecurring insurance reimbursement. Depreciation and amortization was flat year to year as a percent of revenue, down $17 million, reflecting continued capital discipline. Other income for the quarter was $39 million, a year-to-year reduction of $48 million, which is a 120-basis-point impact to EBIT margin, driven by lower pension income of $26 million and lower gains on asset sales of $19 million. Now, turning to our segment results. For GBS, organic revenue performance was nearly flat year to year, with the deceleration largely driven by the ongoing challenging market environment for Analytics and Engineering and Applications. GBS profit margin equaled 13.3%, down 40 basis points year to year but up 140 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a more favorable mix of higher-margin services revenue. For GIS, organic revenue declined 9.3%, largely consistent with our performance throughout the year. We have taken a very disciplined financial approach with new deals and renewals, and this has been reflected in our bookings and revenue performance of both Cloud and ITO and Modern Workplace. GIS margins declined 40 basis points year to year, with operational improvements more than offset by a lower level of pension income. Let me now provide some detail on our individual offerings, first in GBS. Both Analytics and Engineering and Applications organic revenue declined 1% year to year as performance continues to be impacted by the current challenging market environment. While the revenue declined, the book-to-bill ratios for these two businesses were 1.0 or better, with strong renewal activity that does not provide incremental short-term revenue but provides longer-term revenue stability. Insurance organic revenue increased 1% year to year. Embedded in this performance is our insurance software and services business, which represents approximately three-quarters of the total, that continued its strong momentum, up 4.5% in the quarter. Normalizing for a significant large perpetual license sale in the fourth quarter of last year, the insurance software and services business grew approximately 9% year to year. The insurance book-to-bill was 0.8x. As a reminder, bookings in this business can vary significantly quarter to quarter based on the timing of large renewals. For example, last quarter, we had two significant renewals, and our book-to-bill was 1.58. Now, moving to our GIS segment. Security declined 9% year over year on an organic basis with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96. Cloud infrastructure and IT outsourcing organic revenue declined 7%, an improvement from double-digit declines we saw in the prior three quarters due to a significant resale transaction delivered in the quarter. The book-to-bill was 0.75x, a result of the ongoing challenging ITO market and our selective approach to new deals. Modern Workplace organic revenue declined year to year in the mid-teens impacted by resale revenue, which was down 30%. Book-to-bill performance this quarter was a strong 1.29x due to several large renewals. Now, turning to our financial foundation. We sequentially reduced our total debt levels by $450 million, and for the full year, our total debt levels have been reduced by $300 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $20 million, up $3 million year to year, reflecting the higher interest rate environment on our short-term borrowings. Restructuring and TSI expense was $21 million, and for the full year, it was $118 million, about half of the level spent in fiscal '23. Operating lease payments of $84 million were down $9 million year to year due to the management of our real estate footprint. The fourth quarter capital expenditures were $125 million and lease originations were $21 million. Our finance lease and asset financing payments continue to trend down, and as a percentage of revenue, capital expenditures and lease originations declined to 4.3%, down more than one point year over year, representing a multiyear low. Turning to capital deployment. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $450 million of cash to reduce our debt levels. We accomplished this by retiring our outstanding balance of commercial paper and continuing to decrease our lease portfolio. We returned $138 million of capital to shareholders, repurchasing 6.2 million shares at a weighted average price per share of $22.30. For the full year, we repurchased over 18% of our shares outstanding at a total cost of $883 million. Since the beginning of the fiscal year '22, we have reduced our share count by more than 30%. As we enter a new fiscal year, I would like to provide clarity on our updated financial priorities. Our plan is to deploy our capital to accomplish two things. First, given our recent revenue performance, we will execute a restructuring program to address excess capacity, largely concentrated in GIS, and rightsize our infrastructure throughout the company to improve profitability. The second priority is to further reduce debt levels, including significantly minimizing finance lease originations. Now, turning to our full year '25 guidance. We expect our total organic revenue to decline 4% to 6%. In GBS, we expect our full-year outlook to be slightly positive, with the first half performance in line with our fourth quarter of fiscal '24 and with a return to growth in the second half of the year. In GIS, given last year's bookings and the resulting impact to opening backlog, combined with continued expected lower resale revenue and deal selectivity in fiscal '25, we anticipate full-year organic revenue to decline in the low double-digit range. Our guidance for adjusted EBIT margin is 6% to 7%. This guidance primarily reflects the impact from lower year-to-year revenue and investments we're making in the business to drive productivity improvements. Additionally, we will be executing on the previously mentioned restructuring action to improve margins on a sustainable basis going forward, with the impact of the savings largely materializing in late fiscal '25 and into fiscal '26. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we continue to rationalize our real estate portfolio. These potential sales will provide a cash inflow outside of free cash flow but will have a negative impact on our adjusted EBIT margin. The potential loss on these sales is not included in the guidance as the market remains difficult and the timing is uncertain. And with this expected adjusted EBIT margin levels, our full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance is $2.50 to $3 with an assumed non-GAAP effective tax rate of 30%. Our free cash flow guidance for fiscal '25 is about $400 million. There are two main drivers contributing to the lower year-over-year level, and without these changes, free cash flow would be at levels consistent with fiscal '24 performance. As I previously mentioned, we will be reducing our debt levels in fiscal '25, and a component of our debt reduction strategy is significantly reducing finance lease originations, which were $185 million in fiscal '24. This change in funding approach will reduce our overall debt levels but will increase our capital expenditures, impacting free cash flow. Also impacting free cash flow will be spending related to the increased level of restructuring, which will be an increase of approximately $250 million year to year. Our expectation is that the restructuring savings will put us on a sustainable path of free cash flow generation above fiscal '24 levels in fiscal '26. As a reminder, our Q1 free cash flow is seasonally lowest primarily due to the timing of bonus payouts and certain annual supplier payments. Consistent with prior years, cash flow generation will be strongest in the second half of the year. And now, our first quarter outlook. In GBS, we anticipate that revenue performance in A&E and Applications will continue to reflect the current challenging market environment. And in GIS, services revenue will decline in the mid- to high single-digit range, with resale taking the GIS decline to double digits. With these factors, we expect total company organic revenue to decline 7% to 8%. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margins in the range of 5.5% to 6%, a function of the lower revenue and first-quarter seasonality, which has consistently impacted our results in prior years. And finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 to $0.60. With that, let me turn the call back over to Raul for key takeaways.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Rob. There is quite a lot to do to operate at a higher level. That's why I'm so happy with the additions to our executive team in the last 60 days. They are all industry veterans with proven track records. We will define success by continuing to perform better every quarter while we transform as quickly as possible. Thank you for attending the call. Operator, we're going to open it up for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Raul, maybe you could just help us understand how your restructuring might be different than many of the CEOs that came before you that had a lot of restructuring as well. It seems like every five years or so, a CEO comes in, looks at the business, and restructures it. Just trying to get a sense of how maybe your plans might look different than what we've seen over the last few decades at CSC and now DXC.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. OK. Great question. Thank you. I know that, as you've mentioned, in the short history of this public company, there have been previous restructurings. But as someone who just got here and have really spent a lot of time operationally looking at our systems, our processes, our entities, our distribution of head count, it's clear to me that the previous restructurings did not set a real, clean, solid, fully integrated baseline for profitable growth. You can look at that in multiple ways: number of systems still in place that were acquired over time, never integrated, never deduped; number of business processes that got stacked on top of each other; number of legal entities. I think anyone that came in would look at the previous work, and again, I know the history is there so I'm not running away from it, but I can tell you that this is a real reset. It is bottoms up. It is a strong foundation to go from and it is absolutely needed because otherwise, we just continue to carry a really not fully functional organization that can take advantage of the opportunities that we have.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then just as a follow-up, any of the restructuring charges, are those through the P&L, so they're in the margin targets that we're looking at? Or are those outside those targets? And then secondly to that, just on GBS, a little bit of a recovery, I think you talked about in the second half of the year. What gives you confidence in that GBS recovery for positive organic growth in the second half? Thanks.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Bryan, this is Rob Del Bene. Thanks for the question. First, on restructuring, restructuring is not included. Consistent with the approach taken since the beginning of the company, restructuring is not included in the adjusted EBIT margin. It obviously is included in the free cash flow numbers. So, that's the answer to your first question. On the GBS first half to second half dynamic, with a difficult marketplace, we do see the first half of the year performance similar to the back half of fiscal '24. We have some encouragement. Our pipelines have been improving, and our conversion rates are consistent. So, with that improved pipeline and conversion rates, we see us going from low single-digit negatives to low single-digit positives in the second half of the year.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer And it's all built on, again, new leadership there, new life cycle management in terms of opportunities. So, pre-proposal, proposal, pitching smarter, better, faster, and also eliminating, frankly, some self-inflicted delivery issues that we have had and, in some cases, we're still working our way out of. As I've mentioned before, this isn't one lever. This is a lot of little levers. And I think one of the things that has given me additional encouragement that I'm looking at it correctly and the team is looking at it correctly is that, as we've brought on great new experienced executives from great companies that have been succeeding in the marketplace all over the world, they have confirmed that it's a very opportunity-rich environment, meaning we have a lot of things that we can be doing better. And if we do those things better, again, not rocket science, operational excellence, and I'd say, in some cases, just getting to average, that will show up top line and bottom line and conversion and show up in gross margins, net margins, etc. So, I feel like we've got a way to go to get to a base and then from that base, we're going to continue to grow off of it. But I think we've got the right people, the right structure, and now the right go-to-market model and incentives, and I'm encouraged.Bryan Keane -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Great. I'll pass the line. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks so much for going through all this. I'm just curious on the bookings side, how that came in versus plan in a little bit more detail, and what we might expect as the fiscal year plays out here in terms of replenish either new logo or renewal.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, Tien-Tsin, thanks. So, the bookings relative to the last forecast we gave 90 days ago were pretty consistent and actually a little better in GBS. And that was really, really due to renewals in A&E were strong and it's the second quarter in a row they've been strong. And in my remarks, I mentioned that those renewals, they don't translate into revenue growth in the first half of the year, but they do provide a solid foundation for the second half. So, we did a little better than anticipated. We did as expected in GIS. And going into fiscal '25, we expect a very similar picture where we have strong renewal activity in both GBS and GIS and then new content and, based on the pipeline, new content in GBS filtering in throughout and improving throughout the year in fiscal '25.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you for that. And then maybe, Raul, just quickly, my quick follow-up, just with the additions to the management team. I know you're bringing some people in from familiar places. Are you done with some of the additions? Do you expect some other turnover or maybe new roles that should expand into the management team? Just curious what your thinking is there. Thank you.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And look, you've seen some of the releases, right? So, we've obviously announced some publicly, and then there are others that we didn't announce but they've joined the team across the organization. I've had the pleasure of working with a lot of great executives over my 25-plus years in technology. And in that journey, we've had the opportunity to work together, and many of the executives that have come here, we've had the opportunity to compete together, work together, and win together. So, yes, we got a few more that are coming. But in terms of looking at the people that we need to execute, building on top of the team that's here, the great team that's here, and adding some great executives that are fit for the roles where we need an additional horsepower, I feel like I've gotten the team 90-plus percent in place.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Good to know. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thank you. First question just on free cash flow. So, understanding you have, I believe, the $250 million restructuring headwind that seems to be the biggest chunk in the year-over-year bridge, but can you talk about otherwise maybe the levers for free cash flow sustainability amid ongoing top line and potentially margin pressure? And can you also talk about maybe the annual outflows associated with capital lease payments going forward, too, after free cash flow?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, in terms of free cash flow, we start from a base of strength three years in a row, over $700 million, $750 million in fiscal '24. And we have that solid base moving into fiscal '25. And as I mentioned, the two impacts to that number are the increase in restructuring of $250 million and then the curtailment or significantly curtailing new lease originations, which does shift the spend over to capex, impacting our free cash flow number in the year. Now, we do have operating leverage with working capital. So, there is room for improvement in working capital. We're going to be taking advantage of that in fiscal '25 and beyond. And again, the purpose of the restructuring is to shore up EBIT moving forward, '25 into fiscal '26, and curtail that headwind that we faced for the last couple of years. So, that's the plan. In terms of cap lease payments, we're in the low 200s, and that will continue to wind down. In '26, it will go from a $200 million range to a $100 million range and then down from there. John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations And just to foot-stomp this, the lease originations will go from $185 million in FY '24 to zero in '25.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So, a very small number.John Sweeney -- Vice President, Investor Relations And that's a $185 million reduction in the free cash flow.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, John.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. That's very helpful. OK. And I guess a follow-up, just as we think about the top line, the '25 guide, as we try to unpack some of the factors you considered here as it relates to kind of revenue retention and whether you're also working to actively prune out any unfavorable basis of business contracts, any pieces of business you're looking at and assessing that's not strategic to the company? Anything that you're working through kind of here to be mindful of as you build the outlook?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, especially in ITO and Modern Workplace where, historically, there's been the packaging of less-than-optimal profitable reselling of products, reselling of software. That guidance or that direction changed when I got here, and we are going to have profitable contracts, profitable relationships. To the extent we don't have them right now, as we get into renewals of contracts, we're going to address that and then put them on the right footing. But the mandate is clear now that this isn't growth, growth at all costs, growth at a loss, this is growth with real profitability and a real foundation.Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And Bryan, just piggybacking on that, we've incorporated that selectivity into our guide on revenue, so that's included, along with continued reduction of low-margin resale. All of that is packed into the GIS element of the guide.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. If I missed it, I apologize. Did you quantify that piece, just so we can kind of parse that out?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Didn't quantify specifically the various elements. But in my opening remarks, I mentioned that we'll be high negative single digits in GIS. And with the resale, it will be negative double digits, low double digits.Bryan Bergin -- TD Cowen -- Analyst OK. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. This is Paul Obrecht on for Darrin. Can you just provide some color on what you're seeing in the broader macro environment and client behavior and maybe how that relates to three months ago? And as you built your fiscal year '25 outlook, were you assuming any improvement in the broader demand as we go through the year?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Look, I think there are a couple of factors, right, with companies that are operating at different levels of efficiency. And I think our issue is being more effective across the whole life cycle of capturing business, new business, solutioning it correctly, pricing it correctly, as well as on our existing business, obviously, winning the recompetes and being able to create the right economic model for those recompetes. We have plenty of opportunity in the universe that we operate in. I think from a macro standpoint, I echo what others have said in the space that some discretionary spending is paused and has lightened up. I do think that that is less of a headwind for us than optimizing our go-to-market and sales functions and getting those better. We have our destiny in our hands by being better against the opportunities that we get to compete on, and that will be a bigger factor for us in the near term than the general macro environment.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in Modern Workplace, you could see or you'll reach a point where 75% of the workforce is nonhuman. Can you just touch on the path to get there and what you're doing right now in the business to improve efficiency?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. If you think about a lot of the work there, it's a lot of resolution, small resolution of items across multiple people, humans, devices, countries, companies, etc. If you look at the focus of AI, specifically Copilot and the ability for agents to use large language models, small language models, real precise models, to really proactively and interactively answer and deal with questions, that's the shift where we're going to be using AI in a manner where we can handle the workload, same or more, with a greater infusion of technology and not relying on an increase of humans or people for that. As we transition that, you'll go from a ratio of roughly 40% to 70-plus percent and that's the reference that I made there. But that's real. That's happening. It's actionable. We're experimenting with it across multiple accounts. And the other piece of good news is that the speed of compute behind AI is doubling every six months. So, the speed, accuracy, and multimodal ability for a virtual agent to really be a great partner in delivering these services at a high quality is there today and getting better, and we're going to take full advantage of it.Paul Obrecht -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking our questions. I appreciate the level of detail here. You talked about working through some of the resale dynamics to help profitability. Can you help us understand any other levers you have across contract profitability, whether that's pricing or delivery?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jonathan, I think there's leverage across the board, in particular, in the ITO business. I'll just take that first. We've been on a march to reduce physical capacity with the revenue reductions we've experienced, and we will continue that this year as well. And the $100 million of restructuring between the $250 million year-to-year growth and the base of $350 million, that $100 million is predominantly on physical capacity. So, that's one element that will deliver savings into the future. The second element is just efficiency and infrastructure at the account level, and we are going after that with the restructuring funding. So, while we're very good at our service delivery levels, we've got high NPS scores, our restructuring is designed to eliminate the overhead within the accounts as opposed to the direct delivery population that we have. And still, we're firmly on that track, and that's how we're going to execute the restructuring. In the GBS business, we have room to improve margins. And specifically, in the Consulting and Engineering business, our margins are below competition, and again, the restructuring is designed to help us narrow that gap to competition in that business unit. That's another lever for us.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up, as you think about the realignment of the company on a business unit basis versus geographic prior, can you talk about some of the client receptivity there?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And it's really the intersection, right? Because it's the intersection of the talent, the managers of delivery at the geography in tight coordination with the offering. And so, what you're getting just from the beginning of the life cycle is better pre-bid solutioning, better solutioning, better deployment once you win. One of the things that companies can trip themselves up on, and we certainly have, is not being timely in the staffing or fully staffing of something that's won. That leads to SLAs. That's completely self-inflicted, 100% avoidable. If you plan better, you execute better. So, that's another example of seeing a lot of little things that other organizations can do, and I know we can do better, that can have an impact. And that impact will be every month, every quarter, and we'll see that. So, those are just some of the elements that I think our new go-to-market really resonates with, both the local geography, engaging the offering at a global level, and ultimately, the most important thing, which is the customer. And in my several dozen conversations in the last 150 days and talking through why we think this is a better way of serving our customers, it's been very receptive and very engaging with our customers.Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst I appreciate that clarity. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Spencer Anson with Susquehanna. Your line is open.Spencer Anson -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. Raul, you had some relationship callouts on the insurance business. Can you just speak to any broader strategic or even tactical opportunities you see there with the insurance business? Thanks.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Great. Yeah. As I looked at every business unit, I think very early on, it became clear to me that we have an outsized opportunity in terms of a return on effort with our insurance business unit. With that opportunity in hand, we're exploring a small select, and experienced group of partners that could help us accelerate growth with a good SaaS and reoccurring services mix while maintaining control of that business unit. So, we're in that process right now. It's a great foundation. It's a great set of customers, a great history with those customers, and really a critical partnership across the world in every aspect of supporting the different product lines that our customers bring to the marketplace.Spencer Anson -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about go-to-market and sales process. I know, Raul, in past conversations, you talked a lot about improving and tightening up the message to customers so that they understand the value that DXC can deliver, etc. And it sounds like with some of the changes that you've made, that the pipeline is expanding but conversion rates are pretty stable. And it sounds like that's kind of the assumption for right now. But like how should we think about the process and the time to start to even improve conversion rates and how that may be helpful to getting the business back to growth?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think it's a function of the fundamentals, right? The fundamentals that we're operating under in ITO and Modern Workplace, the new leadership and the focus on key vertical solutions, replicability in Consulting and Engineering Services. And also, in talking to customers, if it's an ITO customer or a Modern Workplace, I always come prepared to discuss something relevant in another business unit that they may or may not be aware of. And frankly, it's a good surprise, but I'm surprised that many of our existing customers where we've got tens, in some cases, hundreds of millions of business in one division, do not know and do not appreciate the talent, the experience that another division has. So, just the more effective cross-pollination, cross-sale in existing accounts is something that I see as an opportunity, and it's relatively low-hanging because, again, in my several dozen meetings, I've always tried to say, \"Hey, as you're thinking about this, did you know we did this?\" And most of the time, the answer is, \"Oh no, I didn't know that. Please, let's follow up.\" So, if you scale that and then operationalize that, we're going to be able to get incremental demand from our existing base because in many cases, we've got a great beachhead, a great history, and a great relationship with one offering and a customer, but that should be a gateway, an effective gateway, a fast gateway to compete with the other offerings. And that mechanism, that orchestration, that collaboration, that packaging up of stories, as I've mentioned before, all of that is happening as we speak. And frankly, it wasn't happening at a good level before.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst And it sounds like then for the most part, I mean, you've talked about some incremental partnerships, for example, on the insurance side. But it sounds like you feel like you have all the, or at least a majority of assets, to be able to execute and deliver that cross-sell. Is that fair? Or are there other things that you think you're going to need to add into the mix?Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. We have what we need to compete. We have what we need to compete profitably and grow. We have to get some internal systems aligned. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, dedupe, streamline, and do some work that should have been done before that wasn't, but we're going to get it done with speed. And we've got to perform every day, every week, every quarter, while we transform and transformation is the restructuring, and we've got to do both quickly.James Faucette -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bradley Clark with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.Bradley Clark -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. This is Brad on for Keith Bachman. I want to ask about your thoughts on GIS and market growth over time. You've alluded to sort of participating in this broader GIS market growth rate, implying perhaps low single-digit decline over time. Is that still how you're thinking about potential growth of both the market and/or GIS longer term given the changes you'll be making to the business?Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Bradley, I think that's about right. We have a very realistic view of the market. And our goal is, after rationalizing the portfolio and focusing on exiting unprofitable contracts and being selective, to get to market growth rates, which we see in the low negative single-digit range. So, that's where we're pointing the business in that direction.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer And just to be clear, we're operating at a worse level than that. So, the first goal is to get to \"normal\" or more baseline with other competitors. And once we get there, then obviously the next step is just to find another target and try to meet and beat it. But in the near term, it is to get in line with our competitors with regards to our growth rate, where it is today, and where it should be as a comp.Bradley Clark -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. I appreciate your insight.OperatorThis concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to Raul Fernandez for closing remarks.Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate all of the employees that come together every day to deliver great services for our customers and value, all the investors. I definitely also appreciate the sense of frustration and urgency to get things done, and that is what I'm 100% focused on.

      "Lightspeed Commerce (LSPD 2.12%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lightspeed fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Gus Papageorgiou, head of investor relations. You may begin.Gus Papageorgiou -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lightspeed's fiscal Q4 2024 conference call. Joining me today are Dax Dasilva, Lightspeed's founder and CEO; Asha Bakshani, our CFO; and JD Saint-Martin, our president. After prepared remarks from Dax and Asha, we will open it up for your questions. We will make forward-looking statements on our call today that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Certain material factors and assumptions were applied in respect of conclusions, forecasts, and projections contained in these statements. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. You should carefully review these factors, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties in our earnings press release issued earlier today, our fourth quarter 2024 results presentation available on our website, as well as in our filings with U.S.and Canadian securities regulators. Also, our commentary today will include adjusted financial measures, which are non-IFRS measures and ratios. These should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for IFRS financial measures. Reconciliations between the two can be found in our earnings press release, which is available on our website, on SEDAR+, and on the SEC's EDGAR system. And finally, note that because we report in U.S. dollars, all amounts discussed today are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dax. Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Gus, and welcome, everyone. As you are well aware, I've recently returned as Lightspeed's CEO. I'm excited and energized to be back in this role and look forward to guiding Lightspeed through the next phase of its evolution, a phase that will be defined by profitable growth. So far, we are off to a great start. I'm happy to announce that this past quarter we delivered revenue of 230.2 million, up 25% year over year, ahead of previously established outlook, and adjusted EBITDA of 4.4 million. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues by 24% to 909.3 million and delivered on our promise of breakeven or better adjusted EBITDA. And I am very proud that payments penetration came in at 32% this past quarter, meeting our target of between 30% to 35% by the end of our fiscal year. Our unified payments initiative has been a resounding success, and I want to thank everyone at Lightspeed that was involved in this effort. It highlights how effective this organization can be when we set goals and work together toward achieving them. I founded Lightspeed with the aim of helping independent businesses bring life into our cities and neighborhoods by helping them create exceptional customer experiences, the kind that stand out from the crowd. Our role is to empower these players with technology that was once available only to large enterprises. And this quarter, we were honored to add a host of compelling new customers, including the five-star Hotel Les Roches Blanches in Cassis on the southern coast of France, which adopted Lightspeed Restaurant to operate their four beautiful restaurants and luxury villa; Johnston Canyon Lodge & Bungalows in Banff National Park, which has chosen Lightspeed to power their restaurant and café; NASA's Langley Research Center, which selected Lightspeed Retail to operate their retail outlet; with multiple locations across the United States, 5 Star Nutrition, supplements and protein retailer that has started to adopt Lightspeed Retail to power many of their retail stores; Ester Restaurants and Bar in Sydney implemented Lightspeed Restaurant to run their highly regarded restaurant. And for our supplier network, we were delighted to add dozens of new brands, including ALDO Group, Saint Owen, and Seven 'til Midnight. Adding new customers is important, but equally important is helping our existing customers grow. I find few things more satisfying than watching our customers leverage our platforms to thrive and prosper. Their stories are inspiring, and I want to share a few with you here today. Mildreds, a vegetarian food restaurant, which opened its first location in 1988 in Soho, has expanded to six locations using Lightspeed Restaurants and Payments. Like many of our customers, Mildreds was using pen and paper to take orders and gated legacy terminals for payments. Lightspeed Restaurant moved them into the digital age and allowed staff to spend more time with their guests and less time placing and waiting for orders and taking payments. By eliminating the mundane administrative tasks that weighed down the staff and management team at Mildreds, they are now focused on opening their next location. Analogue October Records has been a customer of ours since founder Craig Crane opened his doors in 2017. His vinyl records store located in Chester, U.K., has seen great success with Lightspeed Retail and Lightspeed Payments. More recently, Craig used an advance from Lightspeed Capital to help take his love for music to the next level and finance his very own record label. Craig's story demonstrates how the expansion of financial services in the Lightspeed platform can help entrepreneurs prosper and grow into entirely new ventures. On the supplier network side, Tribal Sportswear, a Montreal-based apparel brand available at over 2,000 boutiques and online shops across North America, wanted to expand their business. However, it lacked the data needed to make informed business decisions, such as how to improve sales forecasting, streamline their sales efforts, and enable broader buyer outreach. By leveraging NuORDER by Lightspeed, Tribal Sportswear gained access to trend reports to identify cost savings, enhance customer segmentation efforts, and expand outreach, leading to a 23% year-over-year increase in orders. Helping real businesses make an impact in their communities is the reason that I founded Lightspeed. The value we bring to the table is to enable businesses like Mildreds, Analogue October Records, and Tribal Sportswear, with solutions that allow them to scale and optimize their operations. One of the areas where I've spent a lot of my time since returning as CEO is on our product strategy, which is an area where we will continue to invest. Overall, I have never felt better about where we stand from a product perspective. As an industry leader, it's crucial that we continue to leverage new technologies to further differentiate our products. Lightspeed has leveraged AI to automate mundane tasks that frees up time for our merchants to focus on their customers. We're constantly exploring new opportunities to leverage generative AI in our business and bring increased value for our merchants through smarter decisions and actionable insights. Through this initiative, we're committing to value-driven innovation for our merchants and focusing our teams on using Lightspeed AI to deliver against three core pillars: making recommendations to improve our merchant sales and profits; forecasting future needs; and reducing the burden of operational tasks to save our merchants' time and money. So, far, we've released several AI-driven innovations, including AI-generated product and menu descriptions and AI-powered configuration recommendations for Lightspeed Restaurant. But this is just the beginning. And, of course, we will continue to innovate our platform outside of AI. During this past quarter, we continued to deliver great new features. In retail, we launched improved forecasting on Lightspeed Retail. Our data shows that on average, the top 5% of any merchant's products are out of stock 21% of the time, leading to lost revenue and profits. Our new forecasting abilities will take into account out-of-stock periods so merchants can more accurately stock their inventory. We also released order tracking on Apple Wallet, allowing Lightspeed e-commerce consumers to track their orders through their Apple Wallet, eliminating the need for emails or third-party sites. In hospitality, we launched major enhancements to Order Anywhere, including order history and account management for Lightspeed Restaurant guests. This new capability facilitates quick reordering, which helps improve repeat business for our restaurant customers. Our success as a company is directly linked to how well our customers perform. So, our product development focus is geared toward ensuring they succeed. Now, I'd like to take some time to discuss the year ahead. I think the accomplishments of this past year place us in an excellent position to pursue our overarching goal of long-term profitable growth. Our go-to-market teams are now focused on our flagship offerings, payments penetration continues its strong upwards trajectory, and we now have positive adjusted EBITDA operations. For fiscal 2025, we are focused on three key operational objectives aimed at achieving our goal of profitable growth. And these are accelerating software revenue growth and gaining market share, continuing to advance adoption of our financial services, and controlling costs and finding operational efficiencies. In terms of accelerating software revenue growth, we are pursuing this goal on two fronts. We are going to improve our go-to-market efforts, and as I already mentioned, continue to invest in product innovation. Having made significant strides with our unified payments efforts, our account managers will now start to return to their traditional role of upselling software, which we expect to gain momentum as we move through fiscal 2025. We also have several other initiatives underway to improve our go-to-market efforts. These include perfecting all aspects of our customer journey in terms of how we land, launch, manage and support our customers. We want to focus our resources on our ideal customer profile to ensure they have a seamless experience with Lightspeed. Our efforts will remain to focus on finding and catering to higher-GDP customers that tend to adopt more software, generate more payments revenue and have lower churn. Updating pricing across our portfolio of products. This will be a targeted effort, and we are looking at both existing and new customers across the organization by product and region. We want to ensure our pricing is representative of the immense value we provide to customers. Increasing our outbound sales motion. We find field reps are better at winning high GDP customers. We are repurposing some of our spend and expect to end fiscal 2025 with north of 100 outbound reps. And finally, we will complement these go-to-market initiatives by investing in growing brand awareness across our retail verticals and in regions where our hospitality offering is strong. As I've already discussed, on the product side, we will accelerate innovation by increasing our investment in R&D. This will include expanding on our established advantages, such as industry-leading inventory management capabilities and supplier network, as well as leveraging new technologies such as AI to differentiate our products. Our second objective is to continue to advance adoption of our financial services, including payments, capital, and instant deposit. 2024 was a transformative year for payments adoption. Payments is now so deeply embedded into our software products that we no longer distinguish the two as separate offerings. Unified payments improved our processes and technologies in terms of selling and onboarding payments customers and we will continue to recognize these benefits during fiscal 2025 and beyond. I expect payments penetration to continue its upward trajectory for this year and next. We also had another good year for capital, which more than doubled revenue in the year. With the expansion of capital to EMEA and APAC, I expect to continue to see impressive growth from this offering. The data we maintain through our POS and payments offerings allows us to mitigate our risk exposure on capital advances while helping to ensure healthy returns. And although we only launched instant deposit last year, it is showing excellent potential for growth. Given the high-margin impact of these products, capital and instant deposit have the potential to meaningfully improve our profitability. Our third objective for fiscal 2025 is to control costs and find operational efficiencies. Last month, we took the difficult but necessary decision to eliminate 280 roles, reducing our headcount-related operating expenses by approximately 10%. In addition, we have taken other actions to reduce costs, such as moving our sales summit to a virtual format and reducing our office footprint. And we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs across the organization and continue to invest in sales and R&D while expanding margins. I will let Asha discuss this topic in more detail and will now turn the call over to her to take us through the quarterly results and provide our outlook.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dax, and welcome, everyone. Lightspeed had another great quarter. I will walk you through our year and latest quarter's performance, then outline some of the cost reduction and margin expansion efforts for fiscal '25, discuss our recently announced share repurchase program, and close with an outlook for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year. On results, most of my commentary will be focused on Q4. But first, I'd like to highlight a few elements from our full fiscal 2024. We delivered on our key goal in 2024. We significantly improved payments penetration, and we achieved positive annual adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Total revenue of 909.3 million grew 24%, surpassing our outlook for the year of between 895 million to 905 million. Subscription revenue was up 8% and transaction-based revenue up 37%. We had a net retention rate of approximately 110%. Gross payments volume as a proportion of GTV ended the year at 32% versus 19% at the end of last year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $35.1 million to $1.3 million. We ended the year with total cash and cash equivalent of 722.1 million, with our capital program using approximately 51.3 million in cash for the year. In terms of the quarter, Lightspeed had another great quarter with revenue coming in at 230.2 million, ahead of our previously established outlook and growing 25% year over year. Our positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 4.4 million. And our unified payments efforts continue to increase the monetization of our trailing 12-month GTV of $90.7 billion. Subscription revenue increased 7% year over year to 81.3 million. Gross margins on subscription revenue came in at 77%, an increase from 75% in the same quarter last year. When removing the impact of share-based compensation expense, gross margin on subscription revenue was 78%, up slightly from last quarter, thanks to a dedicated effort to consolidate cloud vendors and improved overall efficiencies. I am very happy with our progress on gross margins for our software revenue. I want to reiterate that for this fiscal year, the vast majority of our account management team, which is usually focused on upselling our customers on software, was temporarily assigned the job of onboarding new payments customers as you heard from Dax. Our account management team historically accounts for approximately half of our new subscription revenue in any given quarter, and this temporary shift in focus impacted subscription revenue growth. We expect that by mid fiscal 2025, the majority of our account managers will return to their traditional role of selling software modules to existing customers. And as a result, we expect software revenue growth to benefit. Transaction-based revenue grew 40% to 139 million. In the quarter, we saw gross payments volume increase 75% year over year to $6.6 billion as a greater portion of our GTV went through our Lightspeed Payments platform. Lightspeed Capital revenue grew 135% as the service continues to be popular with our customers. Lightspeed Capital offers fast access to capital and an automatic repayment method through Lightspeed Payments. Merchants are using this offering to finance inventory, to upgrade equipment, and to expand their overall business. Gross margins for transaction-based revenue came in at 29%, down slightly from the previous quarter, as declining referral fees were partially offset by rising high-margin capital revenue. As we convert referral customers to Lightspeed Payments, we increase our overall net gross profit dollars. Total adjusted gross margin, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, came in at 44%, slightly up from the previous quarter and down year over year. Adjusted gross profit dollars came in at 100.7 million, an increase of 15% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter came in positive at $4.4 million. This is much improved from an adjusted EBITDA loss of 4.3 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement is the result of our growing gross profit and continued focus on prudent spend across our organization. Total adjusted R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses were up 4% from a year ago. This was partially due to increased operating expenses tied to the growth of our capital program and ensuring we have the right risk mitigation tools in place to scale that business. We have deployed several AI-based customer support tools that have helped us lower costs but also improve customer satisfaction. We will continue to leverage this technology in fiscal 2025. As a percentage of revenue and gross profit, total adjusted R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses declined year over year. We had an adjusted income of 8.5 million versus an adjusted income of 0.4 million last year, thanks largely to the improvement in the items driving our adjusted EBITDA performance and growing net interest income in the quarter, which increased by approximately 0.9 million from a year ago. We continue to actively manage our share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, which were $8.1 million when excluding restructuring, down from 16 million a year ago and approximately 4% of revenue, down from 9% in the same quarter last year, due to the ongoing prudent management of our equity pool, as well as certain forfeitures this quarter. GTV from our flagships continued to be strong this quarter, up 29%, demonstrating that for our target customers and with our flagship products, we're seeing good success with attracting the right customer base. In retail, same-store sales were largely flat in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. And much like the rest of the industry, we had a challenging month of January. Total GTV growth was more modest this year, owing to a challenging macro environment and given management's attention was focused on unified payments. Overall GTV in the quarter, including nonflagship offerings, came in at $20.7 billion, up 2% year over year. In fiscal 2025, increasing our high GTV customer base and growing our GTV will be a major focus for both retail as well as hospitality. As Dax mentioned, we are perfecting how we land, launch, manage, and support our customers. Increasing outbound sales efforts is part of this, but there are several other initiatives underway. We're already seeing the positive impact of these efforts and expect these to continue to bear fruit throughout fiscal 2025. This quarter, we also continued to grow our sophisticated higher GTV customer base. Customer locations with GTV exceeding $1 million a year grew by 6%, and $500,000 a year grew by 5% in the quarter, whereas those with GTV under $200,000 a year continued to decline. Total ARPU in the quarter came in at $431, up 29% year over year. Unified payments and our flagship products are helping to increase overall ARPU, given that we are going to market exclusively with our flagships and mandating payments for all eligible new and existing customers. Churn rates in the quarter are still below the levels we had anticipated for unified payments, and the vast majority of our overall location churn is in the cohort processing under $200,000 in annual GTV, contributing to a net retention rate for the full year of approximately 110%. In terms of our balance sheet, Lightspeed closed the quarter with just over 722 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from approximately 749 million in the previous quarter. Merchant cash advances used 18.5 million of capital during the quarter. For fiscal 2025, we expect to meaningfully improve overall cash burn after removing cash used in our Lightspeed Capital program. We continued our efforts with unified payments in the quarter, with GPV as a percentage of GTV coming in at 32%, achieving our goal of between 30% to 35% of GTV by the end of the year. Unified payments has been a success for us. We have received very strong feedback from our customers. The LTV-to-CAC of our customers improves when customers add payments. Although the launch of unified payments is behind us, we will continue to focus on monetizing more of our GTV through Lightspeed Payments, which is inevitable given that, today, our software and payments are sold as one unified platform. Now, onto our cost reduction and margin expansion efforts. As many of you are aware, last month, we announced a workforce reduction initiative that is expected to reduce our headcount-related operating expenses by 10% for fiscal 2025. These cuts were largely focused on nonrevenue generating roles. In addition to the workforce reduction, we continue to assess other areas to cut costs. We are undertaking a thorough review of our global facilities to identify areas where we can rationalize our footprint. We're also examining contracts with partners and vendors to see where we could recognize greater savings. I believe that although we have done an excellent job at integrating our various acquisitions into two core flagship platforms, there is still room to optimize our operations and recognize synergies. Offsetting these cost reductions, in part, we will be making investments in product and go-to-market. As we have mentioned, we do plan to grow our outbound sales team as they are more effective at winning our ideal customer profile. And as Dax mentioned, we will continue to invest in product innovation to ensure we maintain our lead for complex, high-GTV, brick-and-mortar merchants. Overall, we expect our adjusted operating expenses to grow in the low to mid single-digit range in fiscal 2025. It will vary quarter by quarter. And remember, Q4 is generally the seasonally weakest quarter from a GTV perspective. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand meaningfully in fiscal 2025 and 2026. In terms of our stock buyback, which we announced concurrently with our cost reductions, our board has authorized a share repurchase program, allowing us to buy back up to 10% of our public float valued at approximately $140 million at the time of our announcement. This program demonstrates our confidence in the financial momentum of our business. We have added the share repurchase program to our overall capital allocation strategy as we believe the current share price does not accurately reflect Lightspeed's value, our market opportunity, or our long-term growth prospects. Our plan is to execute the program opportunistically, aiming to deliver maximum value for our shareholders. With a strong balance sheet and improving profitability, we are well-positioned from a capital perspective to repurchase shares while continuing to execute our long-term strategy. Now, onto our outlook. In 2025, we anticipate significant improvement in our adjusted EBITDA performance. From an operational standpoint, the restructuring we announced last month has been substantially completed, benefiting both this quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we will continue to identify operational efficiencies throughout the year. Regarding growth, we have implemented several initiatives aimed at boosting software adoption and customer growth. These efforts will be rolled out at various stages during the fiscal year. As a result, subscription-based revenue growth will be more pronounced in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half, and we remain confident that we will continue monetizing more of our gross transaction volume through our payments platform. Given our deliberate focus on expanding adjusted EBITDA profitability in fiscal 2025, we anticipate overall revenue growth of at least 20%, accompanied by an adjusted EBITDA of no less than $40 million. This will put us at over $1 billion in revenue, an exciting milestone for the company. For the first quarter, our revenue projection falls within the range of approximately 255 million to 260 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 23%. Additionally, we expect adjusted EBITDA to reach approximately $7 million, an improvement of $14 million compared to the same period last year. As we move forward, we anticipate that software growth for the first quarter will remain at levels similar to what we observed in the previous quarter, with quarterly subscription revenue growth gradually ramping up throughout the year to 10% to 15% growth. With that, I will hand the call back to the operator to take your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC. Your line is open.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, and nice results here. I just wanted to touch on, you know, the pivot of the sales force going back to subscription-based revenues away from payments a little bit. And just -- the question there is, obviously, we've got a ramp into the second half as you were just describing, is there any expected fallout in terms of payments penetration as a result of that? I know you're saying it's going to continue to climb throughout the year, but I'm just wondering how that interplay is going to work since, when you pivoted to payments, it obviously drove an enormous. And if you're pivoting away, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that penetration rate throughout the year? Or are you just suggesting that because now it's so unified, that if you're just selling subscription, payments will follow? So, thanks.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for the question. JD Saint-Martin here. Maybe let me start just by saying, you know, when Lightspeed is focused on something, we get it done. And to your point, last year the focus was really unified payments, and you can see the results in top line and bottom line. That said, what I'm most excited about is all the foundational work behind the scenes that we did that sets us up for the future, and we don't always get credit for that. After all our acquisitions, we've moved to a single flagship per industry, moving to a single tech stack of systems and tools that will really set us up incredibly well to drive innovation to our customers and ultimately also run the playbooks that allows us to continue to gain market share in the segments that we focus on. As far as the AM motion is concerned, you know, from a go-forward perspective, as we come out of unified payments and that program, our AM team is rotating back to a balanced approach of cross-selling payments as well as upselling software and mitigating churn. As you know, our AM team is a driving force here at Lightspeed, typically accounts for about 50% of our software bookings. So, you can expect substantial improvements throughout the year as we drum up pipeline and it makes its way through to revenue from a subscription perspective. It's worth highlighting beyond AM as well, on the new customer front, we have various initiatives that will drive more sales in the $500,000-plus segments and ultimately that will have a positive impact on subscription and payments. You know, worth highlighting that our flagship products have a higher ARPU and that's going to make its way through. But that said, you know, payments is still a focus. It's one of our OKRs this year and we're going to continue to make progress on payments penetration; 32% is a step forward, but there's a lot more coming. Asha, maybe you want to touch on that?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So, thanks for the question, Dan. With respect to payments penetration, JD just touched on the subscription, but from a payments penetration perspective, as I said in the opening remarks, it's inevitable that we continue to monetize more and more of our GTV through payments because now we're selling our software as one unified platform with payments. So, that ultimately means that the majority of any new GTV coming in will be monetized on payments right away. And, you know, we've said in the past that we expect to end fiscal '25 in the 40% to 45% range on payments penetration, and, you know, we're still confident with that trajectory.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great, that's great. Can I just ask one quick follow-up on transaction gross margins? And here the question really is the interplay between like Lightspeed Capital and then you've got, I guess, instant deposit and the payments gross margin, obviously, which is lower. But the transaction margin held in pretty good this quarter on a sequential basis. And I'm wondering, as we think about the cadence for next year, is it possible that we could have kind of flat to up margins, maybe not for the full year, but just, you know, in any one of those sequential quarters? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. You know, you've heard us say this before, there's lots of puts and takes in the transaction gross margin, but you're absolutely right. We expect it to be stable or even higher than what you're seeing today. And I'll give you the pluses and the minuses that are driving that. On the residuals piece, as payment residuals come down, as we move these customers over to Lightspeed Payments, we get more gross profit dollars. So, it's great for Lightspeed, but it does put downward pressure on the transaction-based gross margin. On the other side, however, we're growing our capital business. It's still a nascent business. You know, we did under $20 million in revenue in fiscal '24. We're expecting to grow that quite nicely. That comes in at 95% gross margins, so that pushes up the transaction-based gross margins. And last but not least is the international expansion on Lightspeed Payments. As you've heard from us, the gross take rates are lower in Europe and APAC. They're in the 1% to 1.5% range. But the net take rates are in the 35% to 40% -- 35 bp to 40 bp range. And so, from a gross margin perspective, Europe and APAC actually has higher gross margins than what we see in North America. They're in the 30%, 35% range. And so, all told, all of those factors together does result in pushing up the overall transaction-based gross margins for Lightspeed.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great. Thanks so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Dax, great to hear you back. Maybe we can just start there. You've been involved with the company over the last two years, but, you know, not at the helm. So, maybe just taking a step back and how you're thinking about the business going forward now relative to the last time you were in the seat?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, excited -- super excited to be back. It's been a great 90 days working with the team. We're in a new phase. This is the profitable growth phase of Lightspeed. So, thrilled to be leading this period of the company. I think for me, how that breaks down is, in fiscal '25, we want to accelerate software revenue growth. JD outlined very well how we're going to go about that. I think we have very compelling products that are tailored for our ICP customer, and we have a very compelling customer journey that we're also tailoring across a land, launch, manage, and support for that ICP. I think we're going to be the software vendor that meets their needs better than anyone else. We can service customer better than anyone else. So, very excited about seeing software revenue grow in fiscal '25. The second part of the profitable growth strategy is continuing payments penetration. As Asha just mentioned, you know, ending the year between 40% and 45%. And then, finally, operational efficiency. This has been our laser focus for the last 90 days, and we will continue to find operational efficiencies throughout the company. And I think we have our marching orders for the year. And you'll see that we're balancing growth and profitability in our guide for fiscal '25.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. And then, maybe I'll just ask the macro question. A lot of your verticals that you play in have a lot of sensitivity to the macro. So, maybe anything that you've seen through May at this point that's worth calling out, be it from points of strength, or, you know, places that are maybe under a little bit more pressure?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Andrew. I'll take that one. So, with respect to the macro, you know, what's contemplated in our guide is very much what we've seen in fiscal 2024. You've heard us say throughout fiscal 2024 that there's certain retail verticals that still haven't come back to pre-COVID levels, bike and home and garden in particular. Their same-store sales are flat or slightly down in those verticals. And, you know, we're continuing to assume those same numbers when we look to fiscal 2025. And despite that, we're confident that we could grow the top line at least 20%. So, what that means for Lightspeed is when those verticals do come back to growing same-store sales year over year, it's a much better outcome for us.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Great. Thank you, Asha.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is open.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. And this is kind of a follow-up to what Andrew was just asking. Just on GTV growth, so the up 2% this quarter, if you could unpack some of the moving pieces within that? I mean, it sounds like there's still some macro pressure in some of those retail verticals, location churn kind of at the low end. But anything else worth calling out there? And I know you guys don't guide GTV growth, but if you could just give us a sense for how quickly you think GTV growth can start to reaccelerate? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. I'll talk about Q4 first. So, I think the first thing that we want to highlight is that GTV growth in our flagships has grown 29% year over year. And that's really encouraging for us. Even when we look at same-store sales, when we look at the same-store sales and the cohort of customers that are on our flagships, that's grown year over year, which is, you know, not what we're seeing overall in our portfolio, which includes non-flagships. And so that tells us that we're targeting the right customer base and that we are increasing our overall base of customers with the right mix. For Q4, overall GTV was about 2%, up -- 2% year over year. And that was heavily influenced by two things. One is the nonflagships that I just talked about, and second was the weather-related issues that we saw in January. You heard that from several others in the industry as well. In particular, it impacted North America hospitality. And because North America hospitality is a big portfolio for us, that did impact the overall GTV growth at 2%. As we look forward into fiscal 2025, you heard from JD earlier that, you know, we've got a very aggressive plan on growing software revenue, which we're really excited about. And, you know, more customer locations, more customer locations in our ICP, more customer locations on our flagships all mean better GTV growth. So, even though we're not guiding GTV growth, we are assuming GTV growing at healthier clips than we saw in fiscal '24 because as you know, fiscal '24 was all about unified payments for us. And with fiscal '25, being focused on increasing our ICPs, increasing our location count in that cohort, we expect GTV to grow as well.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK, great. And then on GPV, could you just give us an update today on where we sit on the mix between U.S. and international? And then, within that, 40% to 45% target for this year, and how you see the mix changing as part of that? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, for sure, Trevor. So, we don't disclose, actually, the overall portfolio or GPV between U.S. and international. But what we have said in the past, and I'll reiterate, is today the majority of the GPV is still from the US portfolio. But that is changing. From about a year ago, I would say in fiscal 2024, the international portfolio has pretty much doubled because of the unified payments efforts. So, even though it's lower than in the U.S., international portfolio is growing, and I alluded to that earlier when I talked about expanding margins and the transaction-based revenue.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, thanks. Congrats from me as well. Two questions. One is on the reacceleration of the software part. Obviously, there's going to be a benefit from the sales guys refocusing. And then, like the other initiative, can you split that into -- is the bigger effort coming more from just kind of refocusing the sales guys, or is it more like the product go-to-market changes there? And then, I had one follow-up for Asha.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, I mean, as I said earlier -- JD here, thank you for the question. So, if you look at our go-to-market motion, historically, our AM team represents about 50% of our software bookings. So, going forward in our land-and-expand model, we're expecting to go back to that healthy balance. And so, to your point, you can expect the subscription line to accelerate going forward. It's probably worth highlighting, too, that we have opportunities from a pricing and packaging perspective that will create additional opportunities for a subscription line and that will play out throughout the year.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, perfect. And then -- thank you. And then, Asha, if you think about the cost actions you took last year and this year, in a way, there's usually a lag effect. So, can you talk a little bit about, like how you see this kind of feeding into your P&L this year? And then, are we done with those efforts now? Or like, how do you see this going forward in terms of optimization of the business? Thank you.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, thanks. Thanks for the question, Raimo. So, with respect to the restructuring that we announced early this quarter, so April 3rd, we do expect to see the benefit of that for the majority of fiscal 2025. The restructuring will be substantially complete in this quarter. So, definitely benefits the full year from a cost perspective. In addition to that, and we said that in the opening remarks, we're looking outside of headcount. We're trying to rationalize our footprint in different offices, we're looking at our IT licenses, and we continue to find cost synergies and expect that we will continue to do so as we move forward quarter by quarter.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you. Well done.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Coad from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the One Lightspeed initiative. It's great that you kind of have 100% attach rate of flagship products for new merchants. I kind of wanted to go back to the topic of converting your back book of merchants over to the flagship products stuff. Curious if you could give us like any numbers, maybe on what percentage of locations are on your flagship products or what percentage of your volume comes from your flagship products? And then, like what is the path forward to getting more of your customers over to those flagship products?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thanks for the question. First of all, the nonflagship platforms are profitable for Lightspeed. Very little in the way of R&D costs and low support costs. But we are focused on creating an easy upgrade path to the flagships. So, right now, we're focused on having migration tools that easily transfer data and configuration, because people do -- our customers will want -- some segments of them will want access to the product innovation that's happening on our flagship products. So, the upgrade program, it's a retention play for customers that have reached the limits of our nonflagship products and are looking for more functionality. And, of course, ARPU is higher on the flagship products and creates revenue expansion opportunities. So, it's a opportunistic sort of upgrade path. And we're creating that path right now with the tooling. And that will happen as the year goes on.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst All right. Awesome. Thank you. And then, just for my second question, I wanted to go back to Lightspeed Capital. Like you mentioned, revenue growth there has been robust. Curious if you guys could kind of like touch on your game plan for this business maybe three years out, like how big can this revenue line get for you? And then, as the business scales, do you plan to only utilize your balance sheet, or do you plan to kind of pursue more of like a forward flow model?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. I'll take that. Thanks, Matt. From a Lightspeed Capital perspective, there is, you know, a huge opportunity. I'll start by saying that. When we look at our peers that are doing capital and have been doing -- you know, having capital for a long time as a part of their business, they're giving out about 1% of their GTV in merchant cash advance. If we were to do 1% of our GTV, that's almost $1 billion in merchant cash advance. So, definitely, a ton of growth potential for this business. What we plan on doing is growing this business very cautiously given the macro. As we've said before, we are in the perfect position to underwrite our customers for capital, determine the creditworthiness of our customers and how much they should be underwritten for. And we've had great success with the business so far, but again, you know, growing it in a very steady and cautious manner. We don't expect that we would use our balance sheet for, you know, several hundred million of merchant cash advances underwritten. We're already in talks with partners. There are lots of interested parties because they recognize that, you know, Lightspeed is in a great spot to underwrite customers. So, we're already in talks with partners today. You know, we have from -- at any given point in time, $50 million to $60 million outstanding from merchant -- from this merchant cash advance business, and, you know, that may go up to $100 million, but we're not planning to leverage our balance sheet for much more than that.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Really helpful. Thanks, Asha.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Baer from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you for the question. I wanted to come back to software and just thinking about the ramp to 10% to 15% growth. You mentioned land, expand, and pricing. Was hoping you could give some color on the contribution, the breakdown, how much growth is coming from pricing? What's really driving that? How much from customer growth? Wondering if the non-Ecwid customer count can grow in fiscal '25. And on the expand, what's the contribution and which modules are driving that? Thank you.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for your question, Josh. I don't think we would disclose the breakdown per se, but I mean, obviously what you can expect is as our AM team is rotating back to a balanced approach, historically, that team was focused on selling software, focused on selling and cross-selling payments, but also mitigating churn. So, that's going to be a big part of our story this year, and that's going to have an impact on subscription revenue. And then, on the new customer front, we have a lot of initiatives. You know, it's been touched on by Dax earlier, but we're really evolving our approach as far as how we land customers that are in that $500,000 cohort. We're going to do more account-based marketing. We're up leveling our outbound efforts. We're up leveling our partnerships. And so, that's bringing in not only customers that have bigger GTV, which is great for payments, but these are customers that have more registers, more locations, and so they have needs for more software. And so, you can see the impact on the software ARPU as well. And then, lastly on pricing and packaging, you'll hear more from us, you know, in the coming months. Obviously, this is an effort that we have to roll out across our portfolio. We have multiple products, multiple regions, and we want to start by communicating with our customers first and foremost. But, you know, we haven't touched pricing and packaging in a long time. And especially as we drive more innovation, there's an opportunity to look at how we bundle software modules. And so, that's also going to impact this year in a positive way and also in a sustainable way for future years to come.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you. That's helpful context. And just on the modules, like not specific contribution, but what are some of the key modules that are -- that customers are adopting?JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah. So, on the retail side, our customers come to us because they have complex omnichannel requirements, right? So, from a module perspective, you know, already you can see a very strong attach rate on e-commerce, and we continue to invest in that product and there's a great opportunity to really improve that. And then, once they're leveraging our platform for front of the house, from a retail perspective. Then, on the back of the house side, we're driving a lot of innovation around analytics and insights. And some of those insights are now leveraging payments as well, which adds another layer of information which is critical and crucial and ties into also customer loyalty. So, on the retail side, you know, we've made a ton of progress with our X-Series flagship and there's a lot more coming up in the coming weeks that I don't want to share a spoiler alert, but that we're very excited about. And then, on the hospitality side, as you know, we're known for insights module. It's probably the gold standard in the industry as far as the type of insights and analytics that we can provide. And so, we've added Lightspeed Insights to our flagship offering on the hospitality front, starting with North America and more recently in EMEA and both U.K. and now Continental Europe. And we're seeing strong attach rates there which drives ARPU upward. And then, the way our pricing works on both sides is also based on register count. And so, as we sign bigger customers, they, by default, you know, add more registers, which in turn drives subscription upward. So, kind of another halo effect on top of the modules that we benefit from as we sign bigger customers.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks a lot. Hey, Dax, good to have you back. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned product strategy being a focus, of course. Just the big picture question of depth versus breadth, as you think about the go-forward on the product side, what's your priority?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer I think it's depth. It's depth for the ICP customer. And as I was saying before, you know, we want to be able to serve this customer. We already do serve this customer better than any other player. This is the complex segment, the merchant that's got complex inventory or in the case of hospitality, complex workflows. And we go deep. We go deep and not only on the product innovation side, but also on the customer journey side, how we land, launch, manage and support that customer. You know, we're using a -- we're going to be leveraging AI to help merchants make -- to give them recommendations, to help them forecast, to remove mundane tasks. So, we're already delivering value on that front. On retail, continuing to build our competitive advantage, those -- that complex inventory management need is served better than us than anybody else managing multiple physical locations. In restaurant, we want to continue to improve the capabilities of our flagship restaurant product. Analytics, as JD pointed out, is a real strength of that product. Nobody does insights better than us. On B2B, we want to continue to build out that product, making it more seamless for retailers and brands to do business with each other. Capital that's being built into the retail software, and that's more than doubled in this last year. And of course, another financial service that's come out this year is instant payout, launched in the U.S. retail this past year, we're going to expand on that.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks for going through that. Just my quick follow-up. Then, just in your view, North America restaurant, I know it gets a lot of attention on the stock side. As you've taken a look at that product and how it's performed, what's your assessment there and your -- their outlook for investing in the product? I've seen it certainly more my personal experience here.Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, a lot of our base is in Europe where we're very strong in fiscalization. But I think in the U.S. hospitality market, we have strengths on the insight side and the analytics side. We have a large base in the U.S.m and we believe that we're going to compete hard for ICP customers in this market. You know, restaurants integrated with hotels, table service, fine dine, resorts, this is where Lightspeed really excels in terms of its feature set.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Dominic Ball from Redburn. Your line is open.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Hello, Dax, Asha, and Martin. Thanks for your question. So, some of your competitors have announced or enacted price rises. I think you mentioned in your opening remarks as well about updating pricing across some of your products. Can we get a bit more color on this? And is there a possibility to increase prices on payment rates as well? And any timeline associated with this would be great. Thank you.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for your question. JD Saint-Martin here. Yeah, so as I said earlier, right, we haven't touched a lot packaging, and there's a real opportunity on that front. So, you know, part of your question is more on the subscription side. We see there's an opportunity there. We want to be conscious of what we announce on this call. Like, we want to first communicate to our customers. And it's a rollout that will take time and will roll out throughout the year across different regions, across different product lines. But there's absolutely an opportunity to rethink our packaging on the front book side from a new customer perspective and then opportunities on the back book for existing customers to align existing customers with our new packaging on the front side. You touched on payments. Yes, there are also opportunities on that front. You know, as our portfolio grows, we continue to see opportunities there, and that's also part of that journey. We want to make sure when we touch pricing and packaging that we look at it from a holistic point of view now that we're both a software and a payments offering. And so, simple answer or quick answer to your question is that there are opportunities on that front as well.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Thank you. Super useful. And just one more, any further details on the transition from legacy products to the flagship products? Last time, we heard it was 30% of merchants. Can we get an update on this?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks for the question, Dominic. We have about one-third or actually a little more of our overall base that's on our flagships today. With respect to the nonflagship products, Dax talked about it a little bit earlier, but these platforms are profitable today. There's very little R&D costs associated with them. There's very low support costs associated with them, because the customers are familiar with those products and have been using them for several years. What we are focused on now is creating an easy upgrade path to the flagships. We want to make sure that our -- migrating to the flagships is not disruptive for our customers, that we've got the right migration tools to transfer the data, to configure their systems overnight. And so, that upgrade program for us is a retention play for customers that have really reached the extent of how they could use the nonflagships and are actually looking for more functionality because the new functionality is obviously being built on the flagships. And then, last but not least, ARPU is much higher on our flagship products. And so, that creates nice revenue expansion opportunities as we do that migration. So, you'll hear more from us on the sunsetting of nonflagships, and we plan to go product by product.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Cool. Sounds good. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Richard Tse from National Bank Financial. Your line is open.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst Yes, thank you. This is James sitting in for Richard. Could you just give us an update on the B2B opportunity and whether you figured out what the revenue model will look like?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We're excited about this product. We've got it integrated into retail. For example, we have customers that can browse catalogs now from within our retail product on new order and can also import purchase orders back into Lightspeed so that those POs can be received. This -- for example, we have a customer that we've spoken about called CSB -- CBS, and they're basically able to save 40 hours a week in basically very repetitive tasks by being able to enable this workflow. We're certainly looking forward to being able to monetize this further. We'll have more news on how we monetize that payments flow. For now, we've got a number of customers that are piloting the functionality -- the purchase order functionality, and we hope to give more of an update at the capital markets day.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst OK. And then, just one follow-up here. With respect to the investments you talked about, could you just elaborate a bit on what those investments would be when it comes to sales and marketing? Sorry. Is it adding new salespeople? And then, on the marketing side, like what do you think you need to do to scale the Lightspeed brand?JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for the question. JD here. So, I think Dax and Asha touched on that, too. But really the investments is across the customer experience. You know, as we said, our focus last year was unified payments. Our focus this year and beyond is going to be really our ideal customer profile and landing and retaining more of these customers. So, in order to do that, we're investing across all the steps of our customer experience. On the land front, as we land customers, Lightspeed has been historically known for a very strong inbound performance marketing motion and we've really perfected that and we'll continue to do that. We also want to balance that with more outbound and more partnerships. If you look at last year, outbound represented about 10% of our bookings from a new business perspective, and we want to double that this year, and we want to continue to raise that bar as the years progress. Partnerships is also a strong motion for us, and we want to continue to raise the bar on that front to get to about 25% of our bookings from a new business perspective, that's coming from partnerships. From an onboarding and launch perspective for ICP customers, we want to increase our coverage of 1-to-1 launch specialists per customer to make sure that our customers are having a great experience going from signing up with us to being transactional and live and using the full suite. And then, on the managed side, we touched on AM quite a bit on this call, but we want to increase our density of account managers and really improve our book coverage for customers that are in high GTV segments. So, adding account managers where it makes sense and where we can really build a strong relationship with these customers, and that's going to set us up nicely for more expansion down the road. And then, lastly, on the support side, we're really evolving the way we provide technical support to our customers. And then, specifically for ICP customers, we're launching new white glove service offerings for the 500K-plus, the 2 million-plus, the 5 million-plus GTV cohorts. So, it's really an evolution of our customer experience across all these steps. And obviously, that's a cohort of customers where the LTV over CAC is very strong for us. The unit economics are very strong for us. And so, we feel confident making those investments will generate the right ROI for the business.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks. I'll pass the line.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Gus Papageorgiou for closing remarks.Gus Papageorgiou -- Head of Investor Relations OK. Everyone, thanks for joining us this morning. If anyone has any follow-up questions, we will be around for the rest of the day, so please feel free to reach out.

      "Lightspeed Commerce (LSPD 2.12%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lightspeed fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Gus Papageorgiou, head of investor relations. You may begin.Gus Papageorgiou -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lightspeed's fiscal Q4 2024 conference call. Joining me today are Dax Dasilva, Lightspeed's founder and CEO; Asha Bakshani, our CFO; and JD Saint-Martin, our president. After prepared remarks from Dax and Asha, we will open it up for your questions. We will make forward-looking statements on our call today that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Certain material factors and assumptions were applied in respect of conclusions, forecasts, and projections contained in these statements. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. You should carefully review these factors, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties in our earnings press release issued earlier today, our fourth quarter 2024 results presentation available on our website, as well as in our filings with U.S.and Canadian securities regulators. Also, our commentary today will include adjusted financial measures, which are non-IFRS measures and ratios. These should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for IFRS financial measures. Reconciliations between the two can be found in our earnings press release, which is available on our website, on SEDAR+, and on the SEC's EDGAR system. And finally, note that because we report in U.S. dollars, all amounts discussed today are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dax. Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Gus, and welcome, everyone. As you are well aware, I've recently returned as Lightspeed's CEO. I'm excited and energized to be back in this role and look forward to guiding Lightspeed through the next phase of its evolution, a phase that will be defined by profitable growth. So far, we are off to a great start. I'm happy to announce that this past quarter we delivered revenue of 230.2 million, up 25% year over year, ahead of previously established outlook, and adjusted EBITDA of 4.4 million. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenues by 24% to 909.3 million and delivered on our promise of breakeven or better adjusted EBITDA. And I am very proud that payments penetration came in at 32% this past quarter, meeting our target of between 30% to 35% by the end of our fiscal year. Our unified payments initiative has been a resounding success, and I want to thank everyone at Lightspeed that was involved in this effort. It highlights how effective this organization can be when we set goals and work together toward achieving them. I founded Lightspeed with the aim of helping independent businesses bring life into our cities and neighborhoods by helping them create exceptional customer experiences, the kind that stand out from the crowd. Our role is to empower these players with technology that was once available only to large enterprises. And this quarter, we were honored to add a host of compelling new customers, including the five-star Hotel Les Roches Blanches in Cassis on the southern coast of France, which adopted Lightspeed Restaurant to operate their four beautiful restaurants and luxury villa; Johnston Canyon Lodge & Bungalows in Banff National Park, which has chosen Lightspeed to power their restaurant and café; NASA's Langley Research Center, which selected Lightspeed Retail to operate their retail outlet; with multiple locations across the United States, 5 Star Nutrition, supplements and protein retailer that has started to adopt Lightspeed Retail to power many of their retail stores; Ester Restaurants and Bar in Sydney implemented Lightspeed Restaurant to run their highly regarded restaurant. And for our supplier network, we were delighted to add dozens of new brands, including ALDO Group, Saint Owen, and Seven 'til Midnight. Adding new customers is important, but equally important is helping our existing customers grow. I find few things more satisfying than watching our customers leverage our platforms to thrive and prosper. Their stories are inspiring, and I want to share a few with you here today. Mildreds, a vegetarian food restaurant, which opened its first location in 1988 in Soho, has expanded to six locations using Lightspeed Restaurants and Payments. Like many of our customers, Mildreds was using pen and paper to take orders and gated legacy terminals for payments. Lightspeed Restaurant moved them into the digital age and allowed staff to spend more time with their guests and less time placing and waiting for orders and taking payments. By eliminating the mundane administrative tasks that weighed down the staff and management team at Mildreds, they are now focused on opening their next location. Analogue October Records has been a customer of ours since founder Craig Crane opened his doors in 2017. His vinyl records store located in Chester, U.K., has seen great success with Lightspeed Retail and Lightspeed Payments. More recently, Craig used an advance from Lightspeed Capital to help take his love for music to the next level and finance his very own record label. Craig's story demonstrates how the expansion of financial services in the Lightspeed platform can help entrepreneurs prosper and grow into entirely new ventures. On the supplier network side, Tribal Sportswear, a Montreal-based apparel brand available at over 2,000 boutiques and online shops across North America, wanted to expand their business. However, it lacked the data needed to make informed business decisions, such as how to improve sales forecasting, streamline their sales efforts, and enable broader buyer outreach. By leveraging NuORDER by Lightspeed, Tribal Sportswear gained access to trend reports to identify cost savings, enhance customer segmentation efforts, and expand outreach, leading to a 23% year-over-year increase in orders. Helping real businesses make an impact in their communities is the reason that I founded Lightspeed. The value we bring to the table is to enable businesses like Mildreds, Analogue October Records, and Tribal Sportswear, with solutions that allow them to scale and optimize their operations. One of the areas where I've spent a lot of my time since returning as CEO is on our product strategy, which is an area where we will continue to invest. Overall, I have never felt better about where we stand from a product perspective. As an industry leader, it's crucial that we continue to leverage new technologies to further differentiate our products. Lightspeed has leveraged AI to automate mundane tasks that frees up time for our merchants to focus on their customers. We're constantly exploring new opportunities to leverage generative AI in our business and bring increased value for our merchants through smarter decisions and actionable insights. Through this initiative, we're committing to value-driven innovation for our merchants and focusing our teams on using Lightspeed AI to deliver against three core pillars: making recommendations to improve our merchant sales and profits; forecasting future needs; and reducing the burden of operational tasks to save our merchants' time and money. So, far, we've released several AI-driven innovations, including AI-generated product and menu descriptions and AI-powered configuration recommendations for Lightspeed Restaurant. But this is just the beginning. And, of course, we will continue to innovate our platform outside of AI. During this past quarter, we continued to deliver great new features. In retail, we launched improved forecasting on Lightspeed Retail. Our data shows that on average, the top 5% of any merchant's products are out of stock 21% of the time, leading to lost revenue and profits. Our new forecasting abilities will take into account out-of-stock periods so merchants can more accurately stock their inventory. We also released order tracking on Apple Wallet, allowing Lightspeed e-commerce consumers to track their orders through their Apple Wallet, eliminating the need for emails or third-party sites. In hospitality, we launched major enhancements to Order Anywhere, including order history and account management for Lightspeed Restaurant guests. This new capability facilitates quick reordering, which helps improve repeat business for our restaurant customers. Our success as a company is directly linked to how well our customers perform. So, our product development focus is geared toward ensuring they succeed. Now, I'd like to take some time to discuss the year ahead. I think the accomplishments of this past year place us in an excellent position to pursue our overarching goal of long-term profitable growth. Our go-to-market teams are now focused on our flagship offerings, payments penetration continues its strong upwards trajectory, and we now have positive adjusted EBITDA operations. For fiscal 2025, we are focused on three key operational objectives aimed at achieving our goal of profitable growth. And these are accelerating software revenue growth and gaining market share, continuing to advance adoption of our financial services, and controlling costs and finding operational efficiencies. In terms of accelerating software revenue growth, we are pursuing this goal on two fronts. We are going to improve our go-to-market efforts, and as I already mentioned, continue to invest in product innovation. Having made significant strides with our unified payments efforts, our account managers will now start to return to their traditional role of upselling software, which we expect to gain momentum as we move through fiscal 2025. We also have several other initiatives underway to improve our go-to-market efforts. These include perfecting all aspects of our customer journey in terms of how we land, launch, manage and support our customers. We want to focus our resources on our ideal customer profile to ensure they have a seamless experience with Lightspeed. Our efforts will remain to focus on finding and catering to higher-GDP customers that tend to adopt more software, generate more payments revenue and have lower churn. Updating pricing across our portfolio of products. This will be a targeted effort, and we are looking at both existing and new customers across the organization by product and region. We want to ensure our pricing is representative of the immense value we provide to customers. Increasing our outbound sales motion. We find field reps are better at winning high GDP customers. We are repurposing some of our spend and expect to end fiscal 2025 with north of 100 outbound reps. And finally, we will complement these go-to-market initiatives by investing in growing brand awareness across our retail verticals and in regions where our hospitality offering is strong. As I've already discussed, on the product side, we will accelerate innovation by increasing our investment in R&D. This will include expanding on our established advantages, such as industry-leading inventory management capabilities and supplier network, as well as leveraging new technologies such as AI to differentiate our products. Our second objective is to continue to advance adoption of our financial services, including payments, capital, and instant deposit. 2024 was a transformative year for payments adoption. Payments is now so deeply embedded into our software products that we no longer distinguish the two as separate offerings. Unified payments improved our processes and technologies in terms of selling and onboarding payments customers and we will continue to recognize these benefits during fiscal 2025 and beyond. I expect payments penetration to continue its upward trajectory for this year and next. We also had another good year for capital, which more than doubled revenue in the year. With the expansion of capital to EMEA and APAC, I expect to continue to see impressive growth from this offering. The data we maintain through our POS and payments offerings allows us to mitigate our risk exposure on capital advances while helping to ensure healthy returns. And although we only launched instant deposit last year, it is showing excellent potential for growth. Given the high-margin impact of these products, capital and instant deposit have the potential to meaningfully improve our profitability. Our third objective for fiscal 2025 is to control costs and find operational efficiencies. Last month, we took the difficult but necessary decision to eliminate 280 roles, reducing our headcount-related operating expenses by approximately 10%. In addition, we have taken other actions to reduce costs, such as moving our sales summit to a virtual format and reducing our office footprint. And we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs across the organization and continue to invest in sales and R&D while expanding margins. I will let Asha discuss this topic in more detail and will now turn the call over to her to take us through the quarterly results and provide our outlook.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dax, and welcome, everyone. Lightspeed had another great quarter. I will walk you through our year and latest quarter's performance, then outline some of the cost reduction and margin expansion efforts for fiscal '25, discuss our recently announced share repurchase program, and close with an outlook for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year. On results, most of my commentary will be focused on Q4. But first, I'd like to highlight a few elements from our full fiscal 2024. We delivered on our key goal in 2024. We significantly improved payments penetration, and we achieved positive annual adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Total revenue of 909.3 million grew 24%, surpassing our outlook for the year of between 895 million to 905 million. Subscription revenue was up 8% and transaction-based revenue up 37%. We had a net retention rate of approximately 110%. Gross payments volume as a proportion of GTV ended the year at 32% versus 19% at the end of last year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by $35.1 million to $1.3 million. We ended the year with total cash and cash equivalent of 722.1 million, with our capital program using approximately 51.3 million in cash for the year. In terms of the quarter, Lightspeed had another great quarter with revenue coming in at 230.2 million, ahead of our previously established outlook and growing 25% year over year. Our positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 4.4 million. And our unified payments efforts continue to increase the monetization of our trailing 12-month GTV of $90.7 billion. Subscription revenue increased 7% year over year to 81.3 million. Gross margins on subscription revenue came in at 77%, an increase from 75% in the same quarter last year. When removing the impact of share-based compensation expense, gross margin on subscription revenue was 78%, up slightly from last quarter, thanks to a dedicated effort to consolidate cloud vendors and improved overall efficiencies. I am very happy with our progress on gross margins for our software revenue. I want to reiterate that for this fiscal year, the vast majority of our account management team, which is usually focused on upselling our customers on software, was temporarily assigned the job of onboarding new payments customers as you heard from Dax. Our account management team historically accounts for approximately half of our new subscription revenue in any given quarter, and this temporary shift in focus impacted subscription revenue growth. We expect that by mid fiscal 2025, the majority of our account managers will return to their traditional role of selling software modules to existing customers. And as a result, we expect software revenue growth to benefit. Transaction-based revenue grew 40% to 139 million. In the quarter, we saw gross payments volume increase 75% year over year to $6.6 billion as a greater portion of our GTV went through our Lightspeed Payments platform. Lightspeed Capital revenue grew 135% as the service continues to be popular with our customers. Lightspeed Capital offers fast access to capital and an automatic repayment method through Lightspeed Payments. Merchants are using this offering to finance inventory, to upgrade equipment, and to expand their overall business. Gross margins for transaction-based revenue came in at 29%, down slightly from the previous quarter, as declining referral fees were partially offset by rising high-margin capital revenue. As we convert referral customers to Lightspeed Payments, we increase our overall net gross profit dollars. Total adjusted gross margin, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, came in at 44%, slightly up from the previous quarter and down year over year. Adjusted gross profit dollars came in at 100.7 million, an increase of 15% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter came in positive at $4.4 million. This is much improved from an adjusted EBITDA loss of 4.3 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement is the result of our growing gross profit and continued focus on prudent spend across our organization. Total adjusted R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses were up 4% from a year ago. This was partially due to increased operating expenses tied to the growth of our capital program and ensuring we have the right risk mitigation tools in place to scale that business. We have deployed several AI-based customer support tools that have helped us lower costs but also improve customer satisfaction. We will continue to leverage this technology in fiscal 2025. As a percentage of revenue and gross profit, total adjusted R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses declined year over year. We had an adjusted income of 8.5 million versus an adjusted income of 0.4 million last year, thanks largely to the improvement in the items driving our adjusted EBITDA performance and growing net interest income in the quarter, which increased by approximately 0.9 million from a year ago. We continue to actively manage our share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, which were $8.1 million when excluding restructuring, down from 16 million a year ago and approximately 4% of revenue, down from 9% in the same quarter last year, due to the ongoing prudent management of our equity pool, as well as certain forfeitures this quarter. GTV from our flagships continued to be strong this quarter, up 29%, demonstrating that for our target customers and with our flagship products, we're seeing good success with attracting the right customer base. In retail, same-store sales were largely flat in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. And much like the rest of the industry, we had a challenging month of January. Total GTV growth was more modest this year, owing to a challenging macro environment and given management's attention was focused on unified payments. Overall GTV in the quarter, including nonflagship offerings, came in at $20.7 billion, up 2% year over year. In fiscal 2025, increasing our high GTV customer base and growing our GTV will be a major focus for both retail as well as hospitality. As Dax mentioned, we are perfecting how we land, launch, manage, and support our customers. Increasing outbound sales efforts is part of this, but there are several other initiatives underway. We're already seeing the positive impact of these efforts and expect these to continue to bear fruit throughout fiscal 2025. This quarter, we also continued to grow our sophisticated higher GTV customer base. Customer locations with GTV exceeding $1 million a year grew by 6%, and $500,000 a year grew by 5% in the quarter, whereas those with GTV under $200,000 a year continued to decline. Total ARPU in the quarter came in at $431, up 29% year over year. Unified payments and our flagship products are helping to increase overall ARPU, given that we are going to market exclusively with our flagships and mandating payments for all eligible new and existing customers. Churn rates in the quarter are still below the levels we had anticipated for unified payments, and the vast majority of our overall location churn is in the cohort processing under $200,000 in annual GTV, contributing to a net retention rate for the full year of approximately 110%. In terms of our balance sheet, Lightspeed closed the quarter with just over 722 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from approximately 749 million in the previous quarter. Merchant cash advances used 18.5 million of capital during the quarter. For fiscal 2025, we expect to meaningfully improve overall cash burn after removing cash used in our Lightspeed Capital program. We continued our efforts with unified payments in the quarter, with GPV as a percentage of GTV coming in at 32%, achieving our goal of between 30% to 35% of GTV by the end of the year. Unified payments has been a success for us. We have received very strong feedback from our customers. The LTV-to-CAC of our customers improves when customers add payments. Although the launch of unified payments is behind us, we will continue to focus on monetizing more of our GTV through Lightspeed Payments, which is inevitable given that, today, our software and payments are sold as one unified platform. Now, onto our cost reduction and margin expansion efforts. As many of you are aware, last month, we announced a workforce reduction initiative that is expected to reduce our headcount-related operating expenses by 10% for fiscal 2025. These cuts were largely focused on nonrevenue generating roles. In addition to the workforce reduction, we continue to assess other areas to cut costs. We are undertaking a thorough review of our global facilities to identify areas where we can rationalize our footprint. We're also examining contracts with partners and vendors to see where we could recognize greater savings. I believe that although we have done an excellent job at integrating our various acquisitions into two core flagship platforms, there is still room to optimize our operations and recognize synergies. Offsetting these cost reductions, in part, we will be making investments in product and go-to-market. As we have mentioned, we do plan to grow our outbound sales team as they are more effective at winning our ideal customer profile. And as Dax mentioned, we will continue to invest in product innovation to ensure we maintain our lead for complex, high-GTV, brick-and-mortar merchants. Overall, we expect our adjusted operating expenses to grow in the low to mid single-digit range in fiscal 2025. It will vary quarter by quarter. And remember, Q4 is generally the seasonally weakest quarter from a GTV perspective. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand meaningfully in fiscal 2025 and 2026. In terms of our stock buyback, which we announced concurrently with our cost reductions, our board has authorized a share repurchase program, allowing us to buy back up to 10% of our public float valued at approximately $140 million at the time of our announcement. This program demonstrates our confidence in the financial momentum of our business. We have added the share repurchase program to our overall capital allocation strategy as we believe the current share price does not accurately reflect Lightspeed's value, our market opportunity, or our long-term growth prospects. Our plan is to execute the program opportunistically, aiming to deliver maximum value for our shareholders. With a strong balance sheet and improving profitability, we are well-positioned from a capital perspective to repurchase shares while continuing to execute our long-term strategy. Now, onto our outlook. In 2025, we anticipate significant improvement in our adjusted EBITDA performance. From an operational standpoint, the restructuring we announced last month has been substantially completed, benefiting both this quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we will continue to identify operational efficiencies throughout the year. Regarding growth, we have implemented several initiatives aimed at boosting software adoption and customer growth. These efforts will be rolled out at various stages during the fiscal year. As a result, subscription-based revenue growth will be more pronounced in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half, and we remain confident that we will continue monetizing more of our gross transaction volume through our payments platform. Given our deliberate focus on expanding adjusted EBITDA profitability in fiscal 2025, we anticipate overall revenue growth of at least 20%, accompanied by an adjusted EBITDA of no less than $40 million. This will put us at over $1 billion in revenue, an exciting milestone for the company. For the first quarter, our revenue projection falls within the range of approximately 255 million to 260 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 23%. Additionally, we expect adjusted EBITDA to reach approximately $7 million, an improvement of $14 million compared to the same period last year. As we move forward, we anticipate that software growth for the first quarter will remain at levels similar to what we observed in the previous quarter, with quarterly subscription revenue growth gradually ramping up throughout the year to 10% to 15% growth. With that, I will hand the call back to the operator to take your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC. Your line is open.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, and nice results here. I just wanted to touch on, you know, the pivot of the sales force going back to subscription-based revenues away from payments a little bit. And just -- the question there is, obviously, we've got a ramp into the second half as you were just describing, is there any expected fallout in terms of payments penetration as a result of that? I know you're saying it's going to continue to climb throughout the year, but I'm just wondering how that interplay is going to work since, when you pivoted to payments, it obviously drove an enormous. And if you're pivoting away, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that penetration rate throughout the year? Or are you just suggesting that because now it's so unified, that if you're just selling subscription, payments will follow? So, thanks.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for the question. JD Saint-Martin here. Maybe let me start just by saying, you know, when Lightspeed is focused on something, we get it done. And to your point, last year the focus was really unified payments, and you can see the results in top line and bottom line. That said, what I'm most excited about is all the foundational work behind the scenes that we did that sets us up for the future, and we don't always get credit for that. After all our acquisitions, we've moved to a single flagship per industry, moving to a single tech stack of systems and tools that will really set us up incredibly well to drive innovation to our customers and ultimately also run the playbooks that allows us to continue to gain market share in the segments that we focus on. As far as the AM motion is concerned, you know, from a go-forward perspective, as we come out of unified payments and that program, our AM team is rotating back to a balanced approach of cross-selling payments as well as upselling software and mitigating churn. As you know, our AM team is a driving force here at Lightspeed, typically accounts for about 50% of our software bookings. So, you can expect substantial improvements throughout the year as we drum up pipeline and it makes its way through to revenue from a subscription perspective. It's worth highlighting beyond AM as well, on the new customer front, we have various initiatives that will drive more sales in the $500,000-plus segments and ultimately that will have a positive impact on subscription and payments. You know, worth highlighting that our flagship products have a higher ARPU and that's going to make its way through. But that said, you know, payments is still a focus. It's one of our OKRs this year and we're going to continue to make progress on payments penetration; 32% is a step forward, but there's a lot more coming. Asha, maybe you want to touch on that?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. So, thanks for the question, Dan. With respect to payments penetration, JD just touched on the subscription, but from a payments penetration perspective, as I said in the opening remarks, it's inevitable that we continue to monetize more and more of our GTV through payments because now we're selling our software as one unified platform with payments. So, that ultimately means that the majority of any new GTV coming in will be monetized on payments right away. And, you know, we've said in the past that we expect to end fiscal '25 in the 40% to 45% range on payments penetration, and, you know, we're still confident with that trajectory.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great, that's great. Can I just ask one quick follow-up on transaction gross margins? And here the question really is the interplay between like Lightspeed Capital and then you've got, I guess, instant deposit and the payments gross margin, obviously, which is lower. But the transaction margin held in pretty good this quarter on a sequential basis. And I'm wondering, as we think about the cadence for next year, is it possible that we could have kind of flat to up margins, maybe not for the full year, but just, you know, in any one of those sequential quarters? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. You know, you've heard us say this before, there's lots of puts and takes in the transaction gross margin, but you're absolutely right. We expect it to be stable or even higher than what you're seeing today. And I'll give you the pluses and the minuses that are driving that. On the residuals piece, as payment residuals come down, as we move these customers over to Lightspeed Payments, we get more gross profit dollars. So, it's great for Lightspeed, but it does put downward pressure on the transaction-based gross margin. On the other side, however, we're growing our capital business. It's still a nascent business. You know, we did under $20 million in revenue in fiscal '24. We're expecting to grow that quite nicely. That comes in at 95% gross margins, so that pushes up the transaction-based gross margins. And last but not least is the international expansion on Lightspeed Payments. As you've heard from us, the gross take rates are lower in Europe and APAC. They're in the 1% to 1.5% range. But the net take rates are in the 35% to 40% -- 35 bp to 40 bp range. And so, from a gross margin perspective, Europe and APAC actually has higher gross margins than what we see in North America. They're in the 30%, 35% range. And so, all told, all of those factors together does result in pushing up the overall transaction-based gross margins for Lightspeed.Dan Perlin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great. Thanks so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Dax, great to hear you back. Maybe we can just start there. You've been involved with the company over the last two years, but, you know, not at the helm. So, maybe just taking a step back and how you're thinking about the business going forward now relative to the last time you were in the seat?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, excited -- super excited to be back. It's been a great 90 days working with the team. We're in a new phase. This is the profitable growth phase of Lightspeed. So, thrilled to be leading this period of the company. I think for me, how that breaks down is, in fiscal '25, we want to accelerate software revenue growth. JD outlined very well how we're going to go about that. I think we have very compelling products that are tailored for our ICP customer, and we have a very compelling customer journey that we're also tailoring across a land, launch, manage, and support for that ICP. I think we're going to be the software vendor that meets their needs better than anyone else. We can service customer better than anyone else. So, very excited about seeing software revenue grow in fiscal '25. The second part of the profitable growth strategy is continuing payments penetration. As Asha just mentioned, you know, ending the year between 40% and 45%. And then, finally, operational efficiency. This has been our laser focus for the last 90 days, and we will continue to find operational efficiencies throughout the company. And I think we have our marching orders for the year. And you'll see that we're balancing growth and profitability in our guide for fiscal '25.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. And then, maybe I'll just ask the macro question. A lot of your verticals that you play in have a lot of sensitivity to the macro. So, maybe anything that you've seen through May at this point that's worth calling out, be it from points of strength, or, you know, places that are maybe under a little bit more pressure?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Andrew. I'll take that one. So, with respect to the macro, you know, what's contemplated in our guide is very much what we've seen in fiscal 2024. You've heard us say throughout fiscal 2024 that there's certain retail verticals that still haven't come back to pre-COVID levels, bike and home and garden in particular. Their same-store sales are flat or slightly down in those verticals. And, you know, we're continuing to assume those same numbers when we look to fiscal 2025. And despite that, we're confident that we could grow the top line at least 20%. So, what that means for Lightspeed is when those verticals do come back to growing same-store sales year over year, it's a much better outcome for us.Andrew Bauch -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Great. Thank you, Asha.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is open.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. And this is kind of a follow-up to what Andrew was just asking. Just on GTV growth, so the up 2% this quarter, if you could unpack some of the moving pieces within that? I mean, it sounds like there's still some macro pressure in some of those retail verticals, location churn kind of at the low end. But anything else worth calling out there? And I know you guys don't guide GTV growth, but if you could just give us a sense for how quickly you think GTV growth can start to reaccelerate? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. I'll talk about Q4 first. So, I think the first thing that we want to highlight is that GTV growth in our flagships has grown 29% year over year. And that's really encouraging for us. Even when we look at same-store sales, when we look at the same-store sales and the cohort of customers that are on our flagships, that's grown year over year, which is, you know, not what we're seeing overall in our portfolio, which includes non-flagships. And so that tells us that we're targeting the right customer base and that we are increasing our overall base of customers with the right mix. For Q4, overall GTV was about 2%, up -- 2% year over year. And that was heavily influenced by two things. One is the nonflagships that I just talked about, and second was the weather-related issues that we saw in January. You heard that from several others in the industry as well. In particular, it impacted North America hospitality. And because North America hospitality is a big portfolio for us, that did impact the overall GTV growth at 2%. As we look forward into fiscal 2025, you heard from JD earlier that, you know, we've got a very aggressive plan on growing software revenue, which we're really excited about. And, you know, more customer locations, more customer locations in our ICP, more customer locations on our flagships all mean better GTV growth. So, even though we're not guiding GTV growth, we are assuming GTV growing at healthier clips than we saw in fiscal '24 because as you know, fiscal '24 was all about unified payments for us. And with fiscal '25, being focused on increasing our ICPs, increasing our location count in that cohort, we expect GTV to grow as well.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK, great. And then on GPV, could you just give us an update today on where we sit on the mix between U.S. and international? And then, within that, 40% to 45% target for this year, and how you see the mix changing as part of that? Thanks.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, for sure, Trevor. So, we don't disclose, actually, the overall portfolio or GPV between U.S. and international. But what we have said in the past, and I'll reiterate, is today the majority of the GPV is still from the US portfolio. But that is changing. From about a year ago, I would say in fiscal 2024, the international portfolio has pretty much doubled because of the unified payments efforts. So, even though it's lower than in the U.S., international portfolio is growing, and I alluded to that earlier when I talked about expanding margins and the transaction-based revenue.Trevor Williams -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey, thanks. Congrats from me as well. Two questions. One is on the reacceleration of the software part. Obviously, there's going to be a benefit from the sales guys refocusing. And then, like the other initiative, can you split that into -- is the bigger effort coming more from just kind of refocusing the sales guys, or is it more like the product go-to-market changes there? And then, I had one follow-up for Asha.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, I mean, as I said earlier -- JD here, thank you for the question. So, if you look at our go-to-market motion, historically, our AM team represents about 50% of our software bookings. So, going forward in our land-and-expand model, we're expecting to go back to that healthy balance. And so, to your point, you can expect the subscription line to accelerate going forward. It's probably worth highlighting, too, that we have opportunities from a pricing and packaging perspective that will create additional opportunities for a subscription line and that will play out throughout the year.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, perfect. And then -- thank you. And then, Asha, if you think about the cost actions you took last year and this year, in a way, there's usually a lag effect. So, can you talk a little bit about, like how you see this kind of feeding into your P&L this year? And then, are we done with those efforts now? Or like, how do you see this going forward in terms of optimization of the business? Thank you.Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, thanks. Thanks for the question, Raimo. So, with respect to the restructuring that we announced early this quarter, so April 3rd, we do expect to see the benefit of that for the majority of fiscal 2025. The restructuring will be substantially complete in this quarter. So, definitely benefits the full year from a cost perspective. In addition to that, and we said that in the opening remarks, we're looking outside of headcount. We're trying to rationalize our footprint in different offices, we're looking at our IT licenses, and we continue to find cost synergies and expect that we will continue to do so as we move forward quarter by quarter.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you. Well done.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Coad from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the One Lightspeed initiative. It's great that you kind of have 100% attach rate of flagship products for new merchants. I kind of wanted to go back to the topic of converting your back book of merchants over to the flagship products stuff. Curious if you could give us like any numbers, maybe on what percentage of locations are on your flagship products or what percentage of your volume comes from your flagship products? And then, like what is the path forward to getting more of your customers over to those flagship products?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thanks for the question. First of all, the nonflagship platforms are profitable for Lightspeed. Very little in the way of R&D costs and low support costs. But we are focused on creating an easy upgrade path to the flagships. So, right now, we're focused on having migration tools that easily transfer data and configuration, because people do -- our customers will want -- some segments of them will want access to the product innovation that's happening on our flagship products. So, the upgrade program, it's a retention play for customers that have reached the limits of our nonflagship products and are looking for more functionality. And, of course, ARPU is higher on the flagship products and creates revenue expansion opportunities. So, it's a opportunistic sort of upgrade path. And we're creating that path right now with the tooling. And that will happen as the year goes on.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst All right. Awesome. Thank you. And then, just for my second question, I wanted to go back to Lightspeed Capital. Like you mentioned, revenue growth there has been robust. Curious if you guys could kind of like touch on your game plan for this business maybe three years out, like how big can this revenue line get for you? And then, as the business scales, do you plan to only utilize your balance sheet, or do you plan to kind of pursue more of like a forward flow model?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. I'll take that. Thanks, Matt. From a Lightspeed Capital perspective, there is, you know, a huge opportunity. I'll start by saying that. When we look at our peers that are doing capital and have been doing -- you know, having capital for a long time as a part of their business, they're giving out about 1% of their GTV in merchant cash advance. If we were to do 1% of our GTV, that's almost $1 billion in merchant cash advance. So, definitely, a ton of growth potential for this business. What we plan on doing is growing this business very cautiously given the macro. As we've said before, we are in the perfect position to underwrite our customers for capital, determine the creditworthiness of our customers and how much they should be underwritten for. And we've had great success with the business so far, but again, you know, growing it in a very steady and cautious manner. We don't expect that we would use our balance sheet for, you know, several hundred million of merchant cash advances underwritten. We're already in talks with partners. There are lots of interested parties because they recognize that, you know, Lightspeed is in a great spot to underwrite customers. So, we're already in talks with partners today. You know, we have from -- at any given point in time, $50 million to $60 million outstanding from merchant -- from this merchant cash advance business, and, you know, that may go up to $100 million, but we're not planning to leverage our balance sheet for much more than that.Matt Coad -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Really helpful. Thanks, Asha.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Baer from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you for the question. I wanted to come back to software and just thinking about the ramp to 10% to 15% growth. You mentioned land, expand, and pricing. Was hoping you could give some color on the contribution, the breakdown, how much growth is coming from pricing? What's really driving that? How much from customer growth? Wondering if the non-Ecwid customer count can grow in fiscal '25. And on the expand, what's the contribution and which modules are driving that? Thank you.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for your question, Josh. I don't think we would disclose the breakdown per se, but I mean, obviously what you can expect is as our AM team is rotating back to a balanced approach, historically, that team was focused on selling software, focused on selling and cross-selling payments, but also mitigating churn. So, that's going to be a big part of our story this year, and that's going to have an impact on subscription revenue. And then, on the new customer front, we have a lot of initiatives. You know, it's been touched on by Dax earlier, but we're really evolving our approach as far as how we land customers that are in that $500,000 cohort. We're going to do more account-based marketing. We're up leveling our outbound efforts. We're up leveling our partnerships. And so, that's bringing in not only customers that have bigger GTV, which is great for payments, but these are customers that have more registers, more locations, and so they have needs for more software. And so, you can see the impact on the software ARPU as well. And then, lastly on pricing and packaging, you'll hear more from us, you know, in the coming months. Obviously, this is an effort that we have to roll out across our portfolio. We have multiple products, multiple regions, and we want to start by communicating with our customers first and foremost. But, you know, we haven't touched pricing and packaging in a long time. And especially as we drive more innovation, there's an opportunity to look at how we bundle software modules. And so, that's also going to impact this year in a positive way and also in a sustainable way for future years to come.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you. That's helpful context. And just on the modules, like not specific contribution, but what are some of the key modules that are -- that customers are adopting?JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah. So, on the retail side, our customers come to us because they have complex omnichannel requirements, right? So, from a module perspective, you know, already you can see a very strong attach rate on e-commerce, and we continue to invest in that product and there's a great opportunity to really improve that. And then, once they're leveraging our platform for front of the house, from a retail perspective. Then, on the back of the house side, we're driving a lot of innovation around analytics and insights. And some of those insights are now leveraging payments as well, which adds another layer of information which is critical and crucial and ties into also customer loyalty. So, on the retail side, you know, we've made a ton of progress with our X-Series flagship and there's a lot more coming up in the coming weeks that I don't want to share a spoiler alert, but that we're very excited about. And then, on the hospitality side, as you know, we're known for insights module. It's probably the gold standard in the industry as far as the type of insights and analytics that we can provide. And so, we've added Lightspeed Insights to our flagship offering on the hospitality front, starting with North America and more recently in EMEA and both U.K. and now Continental Europe. And we're seeing strong attach rates there which drives ARPU upward. And then, the way our pricing works on both sides is also based on register count. And so, as we sign bigger customers, they, by default, you know, add more registers, which in turn drives subscription upward. So, kind of another halo effect on top of the modules that we benefit from as we sign bigger customers.Josh Baer -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks a lot. Hey, Dax, good to have you back. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned product strategy being a focus, of course. Just the big picture question of depth versus breadth, as you think about the go-forward on the product side, what's your priority?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer I think it's depth. It's depth for the ICP customer. And as I was saying before, you know, we want to be able to serve this customer. We already do serve this customer better than any other player. This is the complex segment, the merchant that's got complex inventory or in the case of hospitality, complex workflows. And we go deep. We go deep and not only on the product innovation side, but also on the customer journey side, how we land, launch, manage and support that customer. You know, we're using a -- we're going to be leveraging AI to help merchants make -- to give them recommendations, to help them forecast, to remove mundane tasks. So, we're already delivering value on that front. On retail, continuing to build our competitive advantage, those -- that complex inventory management need is served better than us than anybody else managing multiple physical locations. In restaurant, we want to continue to improve the capabilities of our flagship restaurant product. Analytics, as JD pointed out, is a real strength of that product. Nobody does insights better than us. On B2B, we want to continue to build out that product, making it more seamless for retailers and brands to do business with each other. Capital that's being built into the retail software, and that's more than doubled in this last year. And of course, another financial service that's come out this year is instant payout, launched in the U.S. retail this past year, we're going to expand on that.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks for going through that. Just my quick follow-up. Then, just in your view, North America restaurant, I know it gets a lot of attention on the stock side. As you've taken a look at that product and how it's performed, what's your assessment there and your -- their outlook for investing in the product? I've seen it certainly more my personal experience here.Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, a lot of our base is in Europe where we're very strong in fiscalization. But I think in the U.S. hospitality market, we have strengths on the insight side and the analytics side. We have a large base in the U.S.m and we believe that we're going to compete hard for ICP customers in this market. You know, restaurants integrated with hotels, table service, fine dine, resorts, this is where Lightspeed really excels in terms of its feature set.Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Dominic Ball from Redburn. Your line is open.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Hello, Dax, Asha, and Martin. Thanks for your question. So, some of your competitors have announced or enacted price rises. I think you mentioned in your opening remarks as well about updating pricing across some of your products. Can we get a bit more color on this? And is there a possibility to increase prices on payment rates as well? And any timeline associated with this would be great. Thank you.JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for your question. JD Saint-Martin here. Yeah, so as I said earlier, right, we haven't touched a lot packaging, and there's a real opportunity on that front. So, you know, part of your question is more on the subscription side. We see there's an opportunity there. We want to be conscious of what we announce on this call. Like, we want to first communicate to our customers. And it's a rollout that will take time and will roll out throughout the year across different regions, across different product lines. But there's absolutely an opportunity to rethink our packaging on the front book side from a new customer perspective and then opportunities on the back book for existing customers to align existing customers with our new packaging on the front side. You touched on payments. Yes, there are also opportunities on that front. You know, as our portfolio grows, we continue to see opportunities there, and that's also part of that journey. We want to make sure when we touch pricing and packaging that we look at it from a holistic point of view now that we're both a software and a payments offering. And so, simple answer or quick answer to your question is that there are opportunities on that front as well.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Thank you. Super useful. And just one more, any further details on the transition from legacy products to the flagship products? Last time, we heard it was 30% of merchants. Can we get an update on this?Asha Bakshani -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks for the question, Dominic. We have about one-third or actually a little more of our overall base that's on our flagships today. With respect to the nonflagship products, Dax talked about it a little bit earlier, but these platforms are profitable today. There's very little R&D costs associated with them. There's very low support costs associated with them, because the customers are familiar with those products and have been using them for several years. What we are focused on now is creating an easy upgrade path to the flagships. We want to make sure that our -- migrating to the flagships is not disruptive for our customers, that we've got the right migration tools to transfer the data, to configure their systems overnight. And so, that upgrade program for us is a retention play for customers that have really reached the extent of how they could use the nonflagships and are actually looking for more functionality because the new functionality is obviously being built on the flagships. And then, last but not least, ARPU is much higher on our flagship products. And so, that creates nice revenue expansion opportunities as we do that migration. So, you'll hear more from us on the sunsetting of nonflagships, and we plan to go product by product.Dominic Ball -- Redburn -- Analyst Cool. Sounds good. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Richard Tse from National Bank Financial. Your line is open.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst Yes, thank you. This is James sitting in for Richard. Could you just give us an update on the B2B opportunity and whether you figured out what the revenue model will look like?Dax Dasilva -- Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We're excited about this product. We've got it integrated into retail. For example, we have customers that can browse catalogs now from within our retail product on new order and can also import purchase orders back into Lightspeed so that those POs can be received. This -- for example, we have a customer that we've spoken about called CSB -- CBS, and they're basically able to save 40 hours a week in basically very repetitive tasks by being able to enable this workflow. We're certainly looking forward to being able to monetize this further. We'll have more news on how we monetize that payments flow. For now, we've got a number of customers that are piloting the functionality -- the purchase order functionality, and we hope to give more of an update at the capital markets day.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst OK. And then, just one follow-up here. With respect to the investments you talked about, could you just elaborate a bit on what those investments would be when it comes to sales and marketing? Sorry. Is it adding new salespeople? And then, on the marketing side, like what do you think you need to do to scale the Lightspeed brand?JD Saint-Martin -- President Yeah, thank you for the question. JD here. So, I think Dax and Asha touched on that, too. But really the investments is across the customer experience. You know, as we said, our focus last year was unified payments. Our focus this year and beyond is going to be really our ideal customer profile and landing and retaining more of these customers. So, in order to do that, we're investing across all the steps of our customer experience. On the land front, as we land customers, Lightspeed has been historically known for a very strong inbound performance marketing motion and we've really perfected that and we'll continue to do that. We also want to balance that with more outbound and more partnerships. If you look at last year, outbound represented about 10% of our bookings from a new business perspective, and we want to double that this year, and we want to continue to raise that bar as the years progress. Partnerships is also a strong motion for us, and we want to continue to raise the bar on that front to get to about 25% of our bookings from a new business perspective, that's coming from partnerships. From an onboarding and launch perspective for ICP customers, we want to increase our coverage of 1-to-1 launch specialists per customer to make sure that our customers are having a great experience going from signing up with us to being transactional and live and using the full suite. And then, on the managed side, we touched on AM quite a bit on this call, but we want to increase our density of account managers and really improve our book coverage for customers that are in high GTV segments. So, adding account managers where it makes sense and where we can really build a strong relationship with these customers, and that's going to set us up nicely for more expansion down the road. And then, lastly, on the support side, we're really evolving the way we provide technical support to our customers. And then, specifically for ICP customers, we're launching new white glove service offerings for the 500K-plus, the 2 million-plus, the 5 million-plus GTV cohorts. So, it's really an evolution of our customer experience across all these steps. And obviously, that's a cohort of customers where the LTV over CAC is very strong for us. The unit economics are very strong for us. And so, we feel confident making those investments will generate the right ROI for the business.Unknown speaker -- National Bank Financial -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks. I'll pass the line.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Gus Papageorgiou for closing remarks.Gus Papageorgiou -- Head of Investor Relations OK. Everyone, thanks for joining us this morning. If anyone has any follow-up questions, we will be around for the rest of the day, so please feel free to reach out.

      "JD.com (JD 2.92%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorHello, and thank you for standing by for JD.com's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After management's prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Sean Zhang, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Thank you. Good day, everyone. Welcome to JD.com first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. For today's call, CEO of JD.com, Ms. Sandy Xu, will share her opening remarks. And our CFO, Mr. Ian Shan, will discuss the financial results. Then, we will open the call to questions from analysts.Before turning the call over to Sandy, let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Please be reminded that during this call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today only and will include forward-looking statements. And please refer to our latest safe harbor statement in the earnings press release on the IR website, which applies to this call. We will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please also refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in the earnings press release. Also, please note, all figures mentioned in this call are in RMB, unless otherwise stated. Now, let me turn the call over to our CEO, Sandy. Sandy? Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sean. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our Q1 2024 results. We kicked off the year with encouraging momentum in Q1. Our top-line growth accelerated and market share expanded. While our bottom line trended healthily in the quarter, more importantly, our users showed strong enthusiasm for our further improved shopping experience and differentiated services. And our net promoter score, the NPS, notably improved year on year. This is a result driven by our strong execution against evolving industry dynamics. Our team stayed focused on our own strengths, strategies, and the pace of development, and continued to drive steady progress across all our strategic initiatives in improving user experience, press competitiveness, and platform ecosystem. Our strong execution is reflected in our improved category performance in Q1. To start with, our general merchandise had a great quarter as our supermarket category returned to healthy growth, while fashion and home goods maintained robust momentum. Particularly, the bounce back of our supermarket category is a great example of how we are able to drive strong business performance by focusing on the key aspects of user experience namely product quality and selection, price competitiveness, and service quality. After spending the past year on strengthening procurement capabilities and upgrading fulfillment networks and operating efficiency, our supermarket category recorded double-digit GMV and revenue growth in Q1 with increased order volume and shopping frequency. We expect supermarket's momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and it to remain an important growth driver in the long run with massive time. Our electronics and home appliances category remains resilient in Q1. We are confident in our market-leading position and proven supply chain capabilities in this category. And we will continue to focus on our own strategies to scale the business and profits with differentiated value-add services, such as one-stop trade-in services, new product launches, more competitive price offerings, and a more dynamic platform ecosystem. Now, let me share some operating highlights we achieved in Q1 in executing on our strategies. First, user engagement. We are excited to see a series of positive signs in both our user base and user behavior in Q1. Our quarterly active customers delivered another robust growth year on year during the quarter, driven by growth across all user groups, including new users, existing users, as well as our PLUS members. As to user behavior, shopping frequency on our platform delivered a substantial double-digit year-on-year growth in Q1, more than offsetting the decrease in average order value as a result of our low price offerings. This led to a relatively stable ARPU in Q1 compared to the same period last year. In addition, driven by our expanding user base and shopping frequency, our order volume continued to increase at a double-digit rate year on year in Q1, a pace we have seen for three consecutive quarters. This robust momentum with users makes us confident to say that our relentless focus in user experience are paying off. We rolled out a number of user experience initiatives, and the team made solid progress in executing them. As such, our NPS continued to rise in Q1 on both 1P and 3P. We believe this is an important driver of our sustainable growth along the way. We are leveraging our core capabilities in supply chain to differentiate user experience on our platform. For example, the integrated trade-in services we provide in our electronics and home appliances category are at an industry-leading level, and we are further working on this to provide users hassle-free services, including coordinated delivery, installation of new devices, and dismantling of used devices. In addition, our supermarket category also made full use of its supply chain to roll out differentiated services, including direct shipment from suppliers to end users [Foreign language] and 24-hour fresh milk delivered to users since production. Among others, our service offerings are catching up on the 3P side as well. For example, our 59 RMB threshold for free shipping now also covers almost all of the 3P products on our platform. We also made progress to expand coverage of our free doorstep picking up for return service among 3P merchants. We are encouraged to see 3P user experience on our platform continue to improve and our 3P NPS score trended upward in the quarter. Moving on to our low price offerings. Our price NPS continue to increase in Q1, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, as our improved price competitiveness increasingly resonates with users. Meanwhile, growth of our user base in lower tier cities accelerated in Q1, exceeding our growth rate in higher tier cities. Order volume and shopping frequency generated by users. And lower-tier cities continued to record double-digit year-on-year growth in the quarter. Faster than that is our total users. Moreover, growth of low ticket-sized order volume continued to accelerate meaningfully in the quarter. All this reflects our increased attractiveness to price-sensitive customers and our abilities to serve them effectively. With our 1P supply chain capabilities and enriched offerings of 3P, we are strongly positioned to pursue low price yet sustainable way. This is the essence of retail, the core of JD business model, and a key competence that helps us stay ahead of price competition. Next, moving on to our platform ecosystem. We were encouraged to see our active merchant base continue to rapidly expand on our platform in Q1, driven by our effective supporting measures and optimized operating tools. Both our 3P user base and 3P order volume continued to grow at a faster pace in Q1 compared to previous quarters. Our marketplace and marketing revenues returned to a positive growth in Q1 as we navigated one of the impacts in the past quarter. This was primarily driven by the growth in our advertising revenues, while commissions remained soft due to our strategy to prioritize ecosystem development over monetization at the current stage. I want to point out that the low 3P monetization rate at the moment does not reflect the true potential of our marketplace and marketing revenues. And we anticipate more upside going forward. That said, we maintain our strategic priority of building a vibrant and thriving platform ecosystem, where both our 1P and 3P merchants are adequately incentivized to better serve users. On a separate note, 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of our listing on Nasdaq. Looking back on the past decade, our revenues have scaled up significantly by 16 times from 69 billion RMB in 2013 prior to our listing, to over 1 trillion RMB last year. Our non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders has expanded by an even more impressive 157 times from 224 million RMB to 35 billion RMB. The total amount we returned to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has surpassed the total capital raised over the course of the past 10 years. And we have created full-time jobs for over 500,000 employees with social insurance and housing fund benefits as of the end of 2023, a 13 times increase compared to 10 years ago. We are proud of our achievements in the past as we created tremendous values to our users, employees, shareholders, and the society as a whole. We have a clear vision to navigate the next decade with our ever improving user experience, stronger price competitiveness, and thriving platform ecosystem. To conclude, 2024 is marked with our consistent strategies and continued execution. And we are pleased to kick the year off with a quarter of accelerated growth and healthy profitability. As we focus on executing our strategies, we will further improve the user experience which leads to stronger demand share and user growth, thus helping to reinforce our market position and expand our market share. This will keep us on a sustainable path of healthy profit and cash flow, allowing us to continue to execute and deliver for the rest of the year and the years to come. With that, I will turn it over to Ian for our financial highlights. Thank you.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Sandy, and hello, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a solid [Inaudible] both top line and bottom line. We also took extra steps to return capital to shareholders. Since the beginning of the year, we had repurchased a total of $98.3 million class A ordinary shares, equivalent of $49.2 million ADS, for a total of $1.6 U.S. dollars, amounting to around $3.1 of our ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31st, 2023. We have also completed our $1.2 billion U.S. dollar annual cash dividend payment in April 2024. This move demonstrates our commitment to creating value for our shareholders through shareholder return and, more importantly, through our sustainable business growth over the long term, as we've done since our listing on Nasdaq in 2014. With that, let me turn to our Q1 financial performance. Our net revenues grow by 7% year on year to RMB 260 billion in Q1. Breaking down the mix, product revenues were up 7%. Within product revenues, our electronics and home appliances category was up 5% in the quarter, thanks to the resilience of mobile phones and home appliances but were offset by the softness of PC due to industry headwinds. Our general merchandise category returned to a solid new growth year on year as supermarket categories rebounded to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Other categories of general merchandise, such as fashion and home goods, also maintained strong momentum in the quarter. Service revenues grew by 9% year on year in Q1, primarily driven by logistics and other service revenues, which were 14% year on year in the quarter. Marketplace and marketing revenues returned to positive growth in Q1 as we've caught more 3P merchants and nurtured our platform ecosystem. Our advertising revenues resumed healthy momentum in Q1 as we include traffic allocation efficiency on both our platform for both 1P and 3P merchants. Commission revenues under marketplace and marketing continue to decrease at this stage due to our supporting measures to merchants to cultivate our platform ecosystem. Now, let me turn to our segment performance. JD Retail revenues increased by 7% year on year in Q1. I would like to highlight that even as we dedicate ourselves to low price offerings, JD Retail's cross-margin continue to increase in the quarter. Higher 1P product sales growth margin across almost all categories. This, again, demonstrates the beauty of JD's business model. With strong supply chain capabilities at our call, we're able to continuously expand our economies of scale and pass the benefits to our users. In addition, we continue to improve our user experience, including lowering the threshold for free shipping, improve user engagement through initiatives -- like our sponsorship of Spring Festival Gala, as a result of these efforts. We achieved higher user shopping frequency and increased order volume. JD Retail non-GAAP operating profit decreased by 5%, and operating margin was down 50 bps year on year to 4.1% in Q1, in line with our [Inaudible] moving on to JD Logistics, revenues of JD Logistics increased by 15% year on year in Q1, with strong momentum for both of its internal and external revenues. However, JD Logistics non-GAAP operating margin increased to 0.5% in the quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to a loss margin of 3.1% a year ago. This is the result of JD Logistics to the optimized fulfillment network and operating efficiency, increased scale benefits, as well as healthier revenue growth. Turning to new business. Please note that from Q1 2024, we start to report Dada's results on the new business. Therefore, this segment mainly includes JD profit, Dada, Jingxi, and overseas business. Revenues of new business were down 19% in Q1, primarily due to the adjustment of Jingxi business. Excluding the impact of the [Inaudible] of JD property, non-GAAP operating loss of new business was RMB 670 million in the quarter, narrowing from RMB 846 million in the same quarter a year ago. Moving on to our consolidated bottom line. Our non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders at group level came in at RMB 3.9 billion, a 17% increase year on year, with non-GAAP net margin coming in at 3.4% at 30 bps year on year. This was primarily driven by increased gross margin, effective investments in JD [Inaudible] and JD Logistics improved bottom-line performance. Non-GAAP diluted net income or ADS grew by 19% year on year in the quarter to RMB 5.65 [Technical difficulty]  Questions & Answers: OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we've lost connection with the speaker line. Please hold, and the conference will resume shortly. Please go ahead.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer OK, we're back. Sorry. So, our last 12 months free cash flow as of the end of Q1 was RMB 51 billion compared to RMB 19 billion in the same period last year. The year-on-year increase of free cash flow was mainly due to our further optimized cash conversion cycle, improved profitability, moderated capex, as well as seasonality factor. Notably, our last 12 months inventory reached a historical low level of 29 days in Q1 compared to 32 days in the same period last year, which also contributed to our increase in free cash flow. By the end of Q1, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, added up to a total of RMB 179 billion. To conclude, we're encouraged by our solid results in Q1. And we're confident to deliver our operating targets while staying focused on executing our long-term strategies. May 24 not only marks the 10th anniversary of our listing on Nasdaq, it's also a start of a new chapter for JD to serve more users and provide them some parallel user experience by developing an ecosystem that fosters the prosperity of both 1P and 3P. With that, I will turn it over to Sean. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Sure. Thank you, Ian. We apologize for the breaking up for today's call. So, for the Q&A session, you're welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English. And our management will answer your question in the language you ask. We'll provide English translation when necessary for convenient purpose only. In case of any discrepancy, please refer to management statement in the original language. OK, Operator, we will open the call for Q&A. Thank you.Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Ronald Keung with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you, Sandy, Ian and Sean. I have a question on our growth and then how do we balance growth and profitability. Let me ask first in Chinese and then I'll translate my question. [Foreign language] Thank you, management. I have a question on our growth, and then how do we balance that with profitability. We've seen many players this year, even our incumbents, I call them, each aiming to grow faster than total retail and aiming to sustain market share. So, in this overall industry, where everyone wants to grow faster than industry, how do we see the key drivers for JD this year? Sustaining, regaining market share across categories, electronic, whether it was a high base last year, how do we see this growth? FMCG and general merchandise just talked about the supermarket growth that Sandy mentioned. How do we keep drivers to grow faster at an industry and from user and frequency perspective, existing to new users? And how do we balance this growth and profitability our targets for margins as more players reinvest for growth? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] Thank you for that -- for your question. So, first of all, I'd like to point out that China has a vast consumption market, and this market continue healthy growth. And in the meantime, [Inaudible] with over 300 cities in China boasting population of over 1 million people. So, in 2023, we see that China's penetration of online physical goods sales stood at around 30%. So, this is a figure expected to rise as the e-commerce platforms and we enhance our efficiency and evolve our business models. [Foreign language] And category-wise, we see certain categories, such as computers and home appliances, have a higher than expected potential to further penetrate online despite that we think these categories already have a relatively high online consumption rate. [Foreign language] And moreover, significant room for online penetration exists in some other categories like we can see, supermarkets, home goods, automotive, garden and outdoors, and services, these categories have a large potential to continue online penetration. And these are also among the fastest growing categories of our platform. So, with that, I want to say that we believe we are still facing a massive total addressable market. [Foreign language] So, in terms of JD's core competitiveness, for JD, we are China's largest retailer leveraging our one-day business. We are able to leverage our offline chain capabilities to provide users with a premium and differentiated user experience and to excel in cost and efficiency management. It also paves way for us to develop our platform ecosystem. [Foreign language] So, as discussed in the last quarter, over the past year, we centered around user experience, low price offerings, and platform ecosystems. And we've taken a set of proactive moves with a focus on business health, including enhancing our [Inaudible] reducing procurement costs, and introducing various customer service upgrade, such as lowering thresholds for free shipping, upgrading monthly price guarantee service, offering free doorstep pickup for returns, and implementing employee policies among others. [Foreign language] So, all our efforts improving user experience has come up with some positive changes in our user growth and engagement. So, in this Q1, both JD Group's and JD Retail's quarterly numbers experienced double-digit growth, continuing the trend of high-growth rate from Q4 last year. So, at the same time, we've also observed a clear uptake in users' shopping frequency as they engage more actively on our platform. [Foreign language] Furthermore, our NPS has shown consistent improvement. So, in Q1, our NPS saw meaningful improvement on both 1P and 3P sides on a year-on-year basis, as well as a sequential basis. While the influx of new members of our platform as we pushed forward our platform ecosystem last year led to some fluctuations in our NPS. Whereas our ongoing improvement in platform governance and risk control have driven an upward trend in user satisfaction. [Foreign language] So, in summary, our efforts have yielded some promising outcomes as we see users might share resumed momentum toward JD's ability to provide more diverse, affordable, and high-quality products at faster speed. It also gives us the confidence to achieve long-term growth, trajectory, and market expansion. [Foreign language]Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] This is Ian to address the second part of your question. To follow up on what Sandy just said, we're confident that our '24 full year growth will outpace China's total retail sales of consumer goods. And we will deliver stable profit for both JV Group and JV Retail. And on top of that, we will remain committed to disciplined investments aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding our money share. So, in JD's view, business growth and profitability is more reinforcing than contradictory. JD's business model is based on supply chain with user experience at the core. [Inaudible] both supply chain efficiency capabilities and user experience. So, we firmly believe that our long-term sustainable profit will stem from our strong market position and exceptional user experience. [Foreign language] So, for JD.com, from our perspective, we believe that by constantly dedicating energy and resources to enhancing product, price, and service, we can deliver superior user experience. And this, in turn, drives up GMV growth and expands our market share. And as our business size expands and the market position gets enhanced, our advantage in supply chain and efficiency is further strengthened, which leads to healthy profit growth. And this enables us to continue to invest in product, price, and service to constantly improve user experience. This forms a virtuous cycle among business growth, user experience enhancement, and long-term profit growth. [Foreign language] So last year, much of our efforts was directed toward internal enhancements, including boosting operational efficiency, streamlining workflows, and enhancing long-term cost competitiveness. And through this process, we identified significant opportunities to further improve our operating abilities, and we believe that strengthening these capabilities is crucial for our success in housing profits and long-term competitiveness. [Foreign language] So, in terms of business focus and investment, since last year, we've been working on several key initiatives. We've lowered the threshold for merchants to onboard our marketplace while we help to enhance the support measures for SME merchants. In addition, we've provided them with a range of effective tools to operate our platform. Therefore, we're able to increase the variety of product choices available to our customers. And regarding user experience enhancement, we've implemented a series of gradual updates of various customer services. These include lowering the threshold for free shipping services for 1P, improving the functionality of our one-click price guarantee feature, introducing free doorstep pickup for return services for both 1P and 3P, and implementing refund only policies, and more. And these industry-leading service innovations have resulted in a notable increase in user satisfaction as evidenced by our rising MPS. [Foreign language] So, to conclude, from the long-term perspective, we will consistently leverage the advantage we have in our 1P and continue to promote our platform ecosystem to strengthen the virtuous cycle between our business scale and profit growth. And we're confident to achieve that objective in the long term. Thank you. Next question, please.OperatorThe next question comes from Alicia Yap with Citigroup. Please go ahead.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you. [Foreign language] Good evening, management. Thanks for taking our question on the solid results. First question is, if the appliance trade in policy were implemented, amid the cautious consumption spend remain, will the policy effective enough to boost consumer to really spend? And what could be the incremental growth JD expect to be able to enjoy from the trade-in policy? The second question is management previously knows that that FMCG will be an important category to support growth for JD this year. Other than low base and easier comp, do you think consumer will really spend more income on FMCG category? If consumer demand remains last year, will FMCG still be the key growth driver this year? Do you anticipate JD to take more share in this category? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] Thank you, Alicia, for your question. First on the trading service. So, as you know, it has been about a decade since China last introduced nationwide trading initiatives. So, for many Chinese households, it's now time to replace their home appliances and other durable goods. And these old products are often low in functionality, high in energy consumption, and may pose risks to health and safety. However, due to the high cost of replacement, many families continue using them for the moment. [Foreign language] This trend, the introduction of a new trading policy, offers incentives to address this long-standing demand. It will encourage Chinese families to trade in their old items for new ones at a lower cost, thereby, enhancing the overall quality of life for many people. [Foreign language] So, currently we've seen that governments at all levels are actively promoting the implementation of trading policies. So, we see the Ministry of Commerce has released the action plan to promote trade-ins for consumer goods, while local governments are also conducting research and making arrangements. And we're also coordinating with different levels of governments, and we look forward to the introduction of additional trade-in subsidizing measures that will directly benefit Chinese consumers. [Foreign language] Meanwhile, at JD, we have collaborated with over 100 brands, including the top brands like Haier Media, Gree, and so on, to launch a trading alliance for household appliances and home goods. And this alliance has so far launched a trade-in subsidizing promotions in 20 cities and regions across China, with the goal of offering more cost saving-and hassle-free trade-in services to consumers nationwide. [Foreign language] At JD.com, we've also been building and refining our trading service capabilities and leveraging our strengths in supply chain, logistics, and services. We continuously elevate the trading service experience to new heights. So, we introduced integrated one-stop trading service, which includes free doorstep pickup, dismantling, handling of the old goods, and free delivery and installation of new goods, etc. And moreover, there are no restrictions on the treating items, original purchase channel, brand, age, or condition. So, with these offerings, JD has shortened the treating process no more than two times of user home visits. So, this is a very unique strength we can provide our services to our users because we're not only having retail services, but also logistic services. And on the back end, we have also done a lot of work over the years to provide the systematic support. So, all of these infrastructures and abilities enable us to provide such a seamless treating services to our consumers today. [Foreign language] So since 2023, more than 16 million users have chosen JD to trade in their old appliances for new ones. And the first time users of our trading service has also recorded a 200% year-on-year increase [Foreign language] So, in 2023, a trading program accounted for mid to high single-digit percentage of JD's home appliances sales. And with the government actively promoting this initiative this year, we anticipate more incremental sales to our home appliances category. And this trading-driven sales are expected to comprise a higher percentage of our overall sales in this category. [Foreign language] At FMCG question, so, first of all, I want to share from the consumption trend standpoint, the overall FMCG sector maintains positive growth momentum. According to the Q1 MBS data, FMCG categories, particularly basic living goods, have shown robust growth. And FMCG and fresh produce are the two sectors that enjoy a rapid increase that enjoy rising sales, whereas they have relatively low online penetration. So, we've seen a lot of online platform and e-commerce players. We are steadily capturing market share from traditional offline markets. [Foreign language]And in light of JD's Q1 data, the anticipated swift rebound of FMCG played a significant role in driving the overall growth of our general merchandise sales and revenues, leading to our general merchandise growth rate outperforming the corresponding industry growth released by MBS. [Foreign language] And in terms of our strategies for the supermarket categories, we've seen significant enhancements in this category as we delve in deeper into each subcategory to enrich product offerings and reduce procurement costs and passing on the benefits to our consumers. And additionally, to address user demand and consumption pain points, we are exploring various measures such as the open sourcing of products, customize the development of new products to provide consumers with high-quality products, competitive prices, and excellent services. [Foreign language] So at the same time, our logistic fulfillment network reform has also empowered us to lower the threshold for free shipping and tailored to the characteristics of different product categories. We are undertaking fulfillment network reforms. As JD's business scale and category mix have evolved significantly over the past years, we've adjusted the algorithm and design of fulfillment network every few years. So, for instance, our unique city-based warehouse model offers a superior shopping experience compared to the industrywide, sending nationwide from one place model. However, our city-based warehouse model requires us to improve scale efficiency, to reduce parcel moving times from one place to another, and reduce the delivery distances through algorithm upgrades, and thereby continuously reducing overall fulfillment costs. [Foreign language] So, all in all, we believe the essence to continue to promote the growth of the supermarket category is to return to the essence of retail, which is to focus on the better cost efficiency and users experience. So, looking ahead, so despite, fierce competition in the supermarket categories and the industry players adopting various strategies, we remain confident in the growth potential of this category and to view the supermarket category as the crucial driver of our overall growth. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Kenneth Fong with UBS. Please go ahead.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Hi, Sandy, Ian, Sean. [Foreign language] Thank you, management, for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one on content. J.D. has been trying different means on the e-commerce content that have been very innovative and differentiating [Inaudible] like merchandise, live streaming, and recently Richard's AI live streaming. We see very positive results. Can management share with us the progress and upcoming strategy for content investment into our core e-commerce platform? And my second question is about shareholder return. We have substantially stepped up shareholder return and repurchased 1.2 billion worth of shares last quarter. How should we think about the pay scale and sustainability of the buyback going forward? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] So, thank you Kenny. Let me share some thoughts on live streaming and content ecosystem. So, for JD Retail, we announced our commitment to strengthen our content ecosystem at the beginning of the year, aiming to offer users more diverse and comprehensive content experience alongside our superior shopping experience because we believe that by offering a premium content, we attract new traffic to our JD's platform and reduce our users acquisition costs and benefit our platform ecosystem. And we also believe that rich content also play a crucial role in increasing user engagement and time spent on our platform, and consequently enhancing our traffic distribution, efficiency, and conversion rates. [Foreign language] So, our attempt on live streaming as was mentioned with the popular sessions led by our category managers during the Singles Day Grand Promotion and our recent showcases featuring an AI digital representative of our founder, Richard, exemplify our commitment to content innovation, leveraging our JD's technological capabilities. And notably, Richard's avatar live streaming, which marks the industry's first live streaming hosted by an AI avatar of an entrepreneur, drew over 20 million views within the first hour, which also showcases our AI and other capabilities and these applications in the e-commerce scenarios. So, moving forward, we will persist in making technological investments centered on JD's core business, including our large language model, etc. [Foreign language] So, we're still at the early stage of our content ecosystem building. And we hope to provide greater exposure and more traffic to high quality and original content and its creators, so thereby adding value to our consumers by helping them discover products and to make informed shopping decisions.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] And so, thank you. To answer your question on the shareholders returns, I would like to draw your attention, our three-year plan for the $3 billion plan. And so far, we still have around $2.3 billion we scheduled in the years ahead. And year to date, we repurchased a total of 98.3 million class A shares -- ordinary shares equivalent to 49 million ADS for a total of 1.3 billion in open markets from both Nasdaq and Hong Kong, accounting for approximately 3.1% of the total ordinary shares outstanding at the end of 2023. [Foreign language] So, in the long term, our returns will focus on our sustainable, healthy business growth, profitability, and dividends, share buybacks, etc. So, we will continue to reward our shareholders through various means in sharing the success of JD's business.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst [Foreign language] Thanks, management, for taking my questions. My first question is about industry and industry competition. How should we think about [Inaudible] and also, how we should think about the industry landscape. How is it different versus this year? My number two question is about ecosystem strategy, the management comments about the number of 3P merchants, as well as contribution in the coming quarters. Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] So, thank you, Thomas. Let me share some plans of the upcoming JD 618 grand promotion. So, this year's grand promotions theme is quality and affordability. We've noticed a trend in the market where many low-priced products appear identical. So, as we continue to implement our low-price strategy, our focus for this year's shopping festival is to highlight JD's ability to offer differentiated, good products at inexpensive price with excellent service. [Foreign language] And this promotion approach and pace will have some difference from the previous years, and all arrangements will be centered on enhancing user experience. And the event will kick off at 8 p.m. on May 31st, with products readily available for immediate purchase. [Foreign language] And we will also remain committed to cultivating strong partnerships with our brands and the suppliers to further solidifying JD's market presence and users mindshare. And we will also set efforts to support SME merchants and to support more than double the number of merchants to achieving over 1 million sales and to support more partners to achieve their growth objectives. [Foreign language] So, overall, we are optimistic about the overall performance for this year's 618 promotion. And we believe that for different market players, we have different strategies in the everyday sales and during the grand promotions. What makes JD stand out is still our advantages in supply chain and the reliability we can offer to our users. [Foreign language] So, we firmly believe that JD's business model, based on robust supply chain and user-centric experience is resilient and sustainable across various economic cycles, and we're confident in our ability to consistently gain market share over the long term with this business model. Thank you.OperatorWe are now --Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Sorry, we haven't been to the second part of Thomas question.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] To address the question about the platform ecosystem, so our initial focus is to expanding our ecosystem scale by attracting merchants. We are actively working on onboarding more merchants and support them in improving their business performance on our platform by offering a diverse range of products on our platform to our customers. And over the past year, we've successfully attracted a significant number of new merchants by continuously streamlining our onboarding processes, reducing their store operating costs, improving operational efficiencies, and providing traffic support. So, in this quarter, the number of active merchants on our platform exceeded 1 million, with the number of active merchants experiencing accelerated growth for four consecutive quarters. And admittedly, our merchant count may not be as high as some other platforms, and we remain committed to further enhancing our merchant recruitment efforts and supporting their activities on our platform, and we anticipate continued growth in the number of merchants in the following quarters. [Foreign language] So, for the second phase of the platform ecosystem building involves encouraging user participation. Ultimately, we aim for it to become a natural process, a natural choice for our users to purchase either self-operated or third-party products. Thus far, we've observed the favorable interactions between our users and third party offerings. In Q1, we achieved accelerated growth in both 3P transaction users and 3P order volume. Meanwhile, NPS for 3P has continued to improve. Since the second half of last year, we've been collaborating with our merchants to pioneer service innovations. This has led to the implementation of services like late delivery compensation, refund-only policies, and free doorstep pickup for returns and more services, all of which have constantly elevated our shopping experience for our top users. [Foreign language] And lastly, we also believe that we will witness an increase in pop sales and revenues. And the prerequisites for this to happen is that we can truly help our merchants to scale up their businesses. From the rapid expansion of merchant members, to active user participation, and to rapid growth of pop GMV, all of this will require time and patience. With the gradual improvement of our platform ecosystem in the long run, the proportion of our 3P orders and GMV will eventually surpass that of our self-operated products. And this will also be a natural choice by our users. [Foreign language] Leveraging our 1P business and the collaboration with merchants from our 3P marketplace, we are able to foster a thriving platform ecosystem and providing richer supplies of high-quality goods and to increase the engagement of our users on our platform so as to achieve a virtuous cycle. And we believe this virtuous cycle will be an important driver for the continued growth of our long-term revenues and profits. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Thank you, operator. So, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thanks for your question. If you have further question, please contact me and our team. We appreciate your interest in JD.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

      "JD.com (JD 2.92%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorHello, and thank you for standing by for JD.com's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After management's prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Sean Zhang, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Thank you. Good day, everyone. Welcome to JD.com first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. For today's call, CEO of JD.com, Ms. Sandy Xu, will share her opening remarks. And our CFO, Mr. Ian Shan, will discuss the financial results. Then, we will open the call to questions from analysts.Before turning the call over to Sandy, let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Please be reminded that during this call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today only and will include forward-looking statements. And please refer to our latest safe harbor statement in the earnings press release on the IR website, which applies to this call. We will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please also refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in the earnings press release. Also, please note, all figures mentioned in this call are in RMB, unless otherwise stated. Now, let me turn the call over to our CEO, Sandy. Sandy? Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sean. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our Q1 2024 results. We kicked off the year with encouraging momentum in Q1. Our top-line growth accelerated and market share expanded. While our bottom line trended healthily in the quarter, more importantly, our users showed strong enthusiasm for our further improved shopping experience and differentiated services. And our net promoter score, the NPS, notably improved year on year. This is a result driven by our strong execution against evolving industry dynamics. Our team stayed focused on our own strengths, strategies, and the pace of development, and continued to drive steady progress across all our strategic initiatives in improving user experience, press competitiveness, and platform ecosystem. Our strong execution is reflected in our improved category performance in Q1. To start with, our general merchandise had a great quarter as our supermarket category returned to healthy growth, while fashion and home goods maintained robust momentum. Particularly, the bounce back of our supermarket category is a great example of how we are able to drive strong business performance by focusing on the key aspects of user experience namely product quality and selection, price competitiveness, and service quality. After spending the past year on strengthening procurement capabilities and upgrading fulfillment networks and operating efficiency, our supermarket category recorded double-digit GMV and revenue growth in Q1 with increased order volume and shopping frequency. We expect supermarket's momentum to continue throughout the rest of the year and it to remain an important growth driver in the long run with massive time. Our electronics and home appliances category remains resilient in Q1. We are confident in our market-leading position and proven supply chain capabilities in this category. And we will continue to focus on our own strategies to scale the business and profits with differentiated value-add services, such as one-stop trade-in services, new product launches, more competitive price offerings, and a more dynamic platform ecosystem. Now, let me share some operating highlights we achieved in Q1 in executing on our strategies. First, user engagement. We are excited to see a series of positive signs in both our user base and user behavior in Q1. Our quarterly active customers delivered another robust growth year on year during the quarter, driven by growth across all user groups, including new users, existing users, as well as our PLUS members. As to user behavior, shopping frequency on our platform delivered a substantial double-digit year-on-year growth in Q1, more than offsetting the decrease in average order value as a result of our low price offerings. This led to a relatively stable ARPU in Q1 compared to the same period last year. In addition, driven by our expanding user base and shopping frequency, our order volume continued to increase at a double-digit rate year on year in Q1, a pace we have seen for three consecutive quarters. This robust momentum with users makes us confident to say that our relentless focus in user experience are paying off. We rolled out a number of user experience initiatives, and the team made solid progress in executing them. As such, our NPS continued to rise in Q1 on both 1P and 3P. We believe this is an important driver of our sustainable growth along the way. We are leveraging our core capabilities in supply chain to differentiate user experience on our platform. For example, the integrated trade-in services we provide in our electronics and home appliances category are at an industry-leading level, and we are further working on this to provide users hassle-free services, including coordinated delivery, installation of new devices, and dismantling of used devices. In addition, our supermarket category also made full use of its supply chain to roll out differentiated services, including direct shipment from suppliers to end users [Foreign language] and 24-hour fresh milk delivered to users since production. Among others, our service offerings are catching up on the 3P side as well. For example, our 59 RMB threshold for free shipping now also covers almost all of the 3P products on our platform. We also made progress to expand coverage of our free doorstep picking up for return service among 3P merchants. We are encouraged to see 3P user experience on our platform continue to improve and our 3P NPS score trended upward in the quarter. Moving on to our low price offerings. Our price NPS continue to increase in Q1, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, as our improved price competitiveness increasingly resonates with users. Meanwhile, growth of our user base in lower tier cities accelerated in Q1, exceeding our growth rate in higher tier cities. Order volume and shopping frequency generated by users. And lower-tier cities continued to record double-digit year-on-year growth in the quarter. Faster than that is our total users. Moreover, growth of low ticket-sized order volume continued to accelerate meaningfully in the quarter. All this reflects our increased attractiveness to price-sensitive customers and our abilities to serve them effectively. With our 1P supply chain capabilities and enriched offerings of 3P, we are strongly positioned to pursue low price yet sustainable way. This is the essence of retail, the core of JD business model, and a key competence that helps us stay ahead of price competition. Next, moving on to our platform ecosystem. We were encouraged to see our active merchant base continue to rapidly expand on our platform in Q1, driven by our effective supporting measures and optimized operating tools. Both our 3P user base and 3P order volume continued to grow at a faster pace in Q1 compared to previous quarters. Our marketplace and marketing revenues returned to a positive growth in Q1 as we navigated one of the impacts in the past quarter. This was primarily driven by the growth in our advertising revenues, while commissions remained soft due to our strategy to prioritize ecosystem development over monetization at the current stage. I want to point out that the low 3P monetization rate at the moment does not reflect the true potential of our marketplace and marketing revenues. And we anticipate more upside going forward. That said, we maintain our strategic priority of building a vibrant and thriving platform ecosystem, where both our 1P and 3P merchants are adequately incentivized to better serve users. On a separate note, 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of our listing on Nasdaq. Looking back on the past decade, our revenues have scaled up significantly by 16 times from 69 billion RMB in 2013 prior to our listing, to over 1 trillion RMB last year. Our non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders has expanded by an even more impressive 157 times from 224 million RMB to 35 billion RMB. The total amount we returned to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks has surpassed the total capital raised over the course of the past 10 years. And we have created full-time jobs for over 500,000 employees with social insurance and housing fund benefits as of the end of 2023, a 13 times increase compared to 10 years ago. We are proud of our achievements in the past as we created tremendous values to our users, employees, shareholders, and the society as a whole. We have a clear vision to navigate the next decade with our ever improving user experience, stronger price competitiveness, and thriving platform ecosystem. To conclude, 2024 is marked with our consistent strategies and continued execution. And we are pleased to kick the year off with a quarter of accelerated growth and healthy profitability. As we focus on executing our strategies, we will further improve the user experience which leads to stronger demand share and user growth, thus helping to reinforce our market position and expand our market share. This will keep us on a sustainable path of healthy profit and cash flow, allowing us to continue to execute and deliver for the rest of the year and the years to come. With that, I will turn it over to Ian for our financial highlights. Thank you.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Sandy, and hello, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a solid [Inaudible] both top line and bottom line. We also took extra steps to return capital to shareholders. Since the beginning of the year, we had repurchased a total of $98.3 million class A ordinary shares, equivalent of $49.2 million ADS, for a total of $1.6 U.S. dollars, amounting to around $3.1 of our ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31st, 2023. We have also completed our $1.2 billion U.S. dollar annual cash dividend payment in April 2024. This move demonstrates our commitment to creating value for our shareholders through shareholder return and, more importantly, through our sustainable business growth over the long term, as we've done since our listing on Nasdaq in 2014. With that, let me turn to our Q1 financial performance. Our net revenues grow by 7% year on year to RMB 260 billion in Q1. Breaking down the mix, product revenues were up 7%. Within product revenues, our electronics and home appliances category was up 5% in the quarter, thanks to the resilience of mobile phones and home appliances but were offset by the softness of PC due to industry headwinds. Our general merchandise category returned to a solid new growth year on year as supermarket categories rebounded to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Other categories of general merchandise, such as fashion and home goods, also maintained strong momentum in the quarter. Service revenues grew by 9% year on year in Q1, primarily driven by logistics and other service revenues, which were 14% year on year in the quarter. Marketplace and marketing revenues returned to positive growth in Q1 as we've caught more 3P merchants and nurtured our platform ecosystem. Our advertising revenues resumed healthy momentum in Q1 as we include traffic allocation efficiency on both our platform for both 1P and 3P merchants. Commission revenues under marketplace and marketing continue to decrease at this stage due to our supporting measures to merchants to cultivate our platform ecosystem. Now, let me turn to our segment performance. JD Retail revenues increased by 7% year on year in Q1. I would like to highlight that even as we dedicate ourselves to low price offerings, JD Retail's cross-margin continue to increase in the quarter. Higher 1P product sales growth margin across almost all categories. This, again, demonstrates the beauty of JD's business model. With strong supply chain capabilities at our call, we're able to continuously expand our economies of scale and pass the benefits to our users. In addition, we continue to improve our user experience, including lowering the threshold for free shipping, improve user engagement through initiatives -- like our sponsorship of Spring Festival Gala, as a result of these efforts. We achieved higher user shopping frequency and increased order volume. JD Retail non-GAAP operating profit decreased by 5%, and operating margin was down 50 bps year on year to 4.1% in Q1, in line with our [Inaudible] moving on to JD Logistics, revenues of JD Logistics increased by 15% year on year in Q1, with strong momentum for both of its internal and external revenues. However, JD Logistics non-GAAP operating margin increased to 0.5% in the quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to a loss margin of 3.1% a year ago. This is the result of JD Logistics to the optimized fulfillment network and operating efficiency, increased scale benefits, as well as healthier revenue growth. Turning to new business. Please note that from Q1 2024, we start to report Dada's results on the new business. Therefore, this segment mainly includes JD profit, Dada, Jingxi, and overseas business. Revenues of new business were down 19% in Q1, primarily due to the adjustment of Jingxi business. Excluding the impact of the [Inaudible] of JD property, non-GAAP operating loss of new business was RMB 670 million in the quarter, narrowing from RMB 846 million in the same quarter a year ago. Moving on to our consolidated bottom line. Our non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders at group level came in at RMB 3.9 billion, a 17% increase year on year, with non-GAAP net margin coming in at 3.4% at 30 bps year on year. This was primarily driven by increased gross margin, effective investments in JD [Inaudible] and JD Logistics improved bottom-line performance. Non-GAAP diluted net income or ADS grew by 19% year on year in the quarter to RMB 5.65 [Technical difficulty]  Questions & Answers: OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we've lost connection with the speaker line. Please hold, and the conference will resume shortly. Please go ahead.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer OK, we're back. Sorry. So, our last 12 months free cash flow as of the end of Q1 was RMB 51 billion compared to RMB 19 billion in the same period last year. The year-on-year increase of free cash flow was mainly due to our further optimized cash conversion cycle, improved profitability, moderated capex, as well as seasonality factor. Notably, our last 12 months inventory reached a historical low level of 29 days in Q1 compared to 32 days in the same period last year, which also contributed to our increase in free cash flow. By the end of Q1, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, added up to a total of RMB 179 billion. To conclude, we're encouraged by our solid results in Q1. And we're confident to deliver our operating targets while staying focused on executing our long-term strategies. May 24 not only marks the 10th anniversary of our listing on Nasdaq, it's also a start of a new chapter for JD to serve more users and provide them some parallel user experience by developing an ecosystem that fosters the prosperity of both 1P and 3P. With that, I will turn it over to Sean. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Sure. Thank you, Ian. We apologize for the breaking up for today's call. So, for the Q&A session, you're welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English. And our management will answer your question in the language you ask. We'll provide English translation when necessary for convenient purpose only. In case of any discrepancy, please refer to management statement in the original language. OK, Operator, we will open the call for Q&A. Thank you.Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Ronald Keung with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you, Sandy, Ian and Sean. I have a question on our growth and then how do we balance growth and profitability. Let me ask first in Chinese and then I'll translate my question. [Foreign language] Thank you, management. I have a question on our growth, and then how do we balance that with profitability. We've seen many players this year, even our incumbents, I call them, each aiming to grow faster than total retail and aiming to sustain market share. So, in this overall industry, where everyone wants to grow faster than industry, how do we see the key drivers for JD this year? Sustaining, regaining market share across categories, electronic, whether it was a high base last year, how do we see this growth? FMCG and general merchandise just talked about the supermarket growth that Sandy mentioned. How do we keep drivers to grow faster at an industry and from user and frequency perspective, existing to new users? And how do we balance this growth and profitability our targets for margins as more players reinvest for growth? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] Thank you for that -- for your question. So, first of all, I'd like to point out that China has a vast consumption market, and this market continue healthy growth. And in the meantime, [Inaudible] with over 300 cities in China boasting population of over 1 million people. So, in 2023, we see that China's penetration of online physical goods sales stood at around 30%. So, this is a figure expected to rise as the e-commerce platforms and we enhance our efficiency and evolve our business models. [Foreign language] And category-wise, we see certain categories, such as computers and home appliances, have a higher than expected potential to further penetrate online despite that we think these categories already have a relatively high online consumption rate. [Foreign language] And moreover, significant room for online penetration exists in some other categories like we can see, supermarkets, home goods, automotive, garden and outdoors, and services, these categories have a large potential to continue online penetration. And these are also among the fastest growing categories of our platform. So, with that, I want to say that we believe we are still facing a massive total addressable market. [Foreign language] So, in terms of JD's core competitiveness, for JD, we are China's largest retailer leveraging our one-day business. We are able to leverage our offline chain capabilities to provide users with a premium and differentiated user experience and to excel in cost and efficiency management. It also paves way for us to develop our platform ecosystem. [Foreign language] So, as discussed in the last quarter, over the past year, we centered around user experience, low price offerings, and platform ecosystems. And we've taken a set of proactive moves with a focus on business health, including enhancing our [Inaudible] reducing procurement costs, and introducing various customer service upgrade, such as lowering thresholds for free shipping, upgrading monthly price guarantee service, offering free doorstep pickup for returns, and implementing employee policies among others. [Foreign language] So, all our efforts improving user experience has come up with some positive changes in our user growth and engagement. So, in this Q1, both JD Group's and JD Retail's quarterly numbers experienced double-digit growth, continuing the trend of high-growth rate from Q4 last year. So, at the same time, we've also observed a clear uptake in users' shopping frequency as they engage more actively on our platform. [Foreign language] Furthermore, our NPS has shown consistent improvement. So, in Q1, our NPS saw meaningful improvement on both 1P and 3P sides on a year-on-year basis, as well as a sequential basis. While the influx of new members of our platform as we pushed forward our platform ecosystem last year led to some fluctuations in our NPS. Whereas our ongoing improvement in platform governance and risk control have driven an upward trend in user satisfaction. [Foreign language] So, in summary, our efforts have yielded some promising outcomes as we see users might share resumed momentum toward JD's ability to provide more diverse, affordable, and high-quality products at faster speed. It also gives us the confidence to achieve long-term growth, trajectory, and market expansion. [Foreign language]Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] This is Ian to address the second part of your question. To follow up on what Sandy just said, we're confident that our '24 full year growth will outpace China's total retail sales of consumer goods. And we will deliver stable profit for both JV Group and JV Retail. And on top of that, we will remain committed to disciplined investments aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding our money share. So, in JD's view, business growth and profitability is more reinforcing than contradictory. JD's business model is based on supply chain with user experience at the core. [Inaudible] both supply chain efficiency capabilities and user experience. So, we firmly believe that our long-term sustainable profit will stem from our strong market position and exceptional user experience. [Foreign language] So, for JD.com, from our perspective, we believe that by constantly dedicating energy and resources to enhancing product, price, and service, we can deliver superior user experience. And this, in turn, drives up GMV growth and expands our market share. And as our business size expands and the market position gets enhanced, our advantage in supply chain and efficiency is further strengthened, which leads to healthy profit growth. And this enables us to continue to invest in product, price, and service to constantly improve user experience. This forms a virtuous cycle among business growth, user experience enhancement, and long-term profit growth. [Foreign language] So last year, much of our efforts was directed toward internal enhancements, including boosting operational efficiency, streamlining workflows, and enhancing long-term cost competitiveness. And through this process, we identified significant opportunities to further improve our operating abilities, and we believe that strengthening these capabilities is crucial for our success in housing profits and long-term competitiveness. [Foreign language] So, in terms of business focus and investment, since last year, we've been working on several key initiatives. We've lowered the threshold for merchants to onboard our marketplace while we help to enhance the support measures for SME merchants. In addition, we've provided them with a range of effective tools to operate our platform. Therefore, we're able to increase the variety of product choices available to our customers. And regarding user experience enhancement, we've implemented a series of gradual updates of various customer services. These include lowering the threshold for free shipping services for 1P, improving the functionality of our one-click price guarantee feature, introducing free doorstep pickup for return services for both 1P and 3P, and implementing refund only policies, and more. And these industry-leading service innovations have resulted in a notable increase in user satisfaction as evidenced by our rising MPS. [Foreign language] So, to conclude, from the long-term perspective, we will consistently leverage the advantage we have in our 1P and continue to promote our platform ecosystem to strengthen the virtuous cycle between our business scale and profit growth. And we're confident to achieve that objective in the long term. Thank you. Next question, please.OperatorThe next question comes from Alicia Yap with Citigroup. Please go ahead.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you. [Foreign language] Good evening, management. Thanks for taking our question on the solid results. First question is, if the appliance trade in policy were implemented, amid the cautious consumption spend remain, will the policy effective enough to boost consumer to really spend? And what could be the incremental growth JD expect to be able to enjoy from the trade-in policy? The second question is management previously knows that that FMCG will be an important category to support growth for JD this year. Other than low base and easier comp, do you think consumer will really spend more income on FMCG category? If consumer demand remains last year, will FMCG still be the key growth driver this year? Do you anticipate JD to take more share in this category? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] Thank you, Alicia, for your question. First on the trading service. So, as you know, it has been about a decade since China last introduced nationwide trading initiatives. So, for many Chinese households, it's now time to replace their home appliances and other durable goods. And these old products are often low in functionality, high in energy consumption, and may pose risks to health and safety. However, due to the high cost of replacement, many families continue using them for the moment. [Foreign language] This trend, the introduction of a new trading policy, offers incentives to address this long-standing demand. It will encourage Chinese families to trade in their old items for new ones at a lower cost, thereby, enhancing the overall quality of life for many people. [Foreign language] So, currently we've seen that governments at all levels are actively promoting the implementation of trading policies. So, we see the Ministry of Commerce has released the action plan to promote trade-ins for consumer goods, while local governments are also conducting research and making arrangements. And we're also coordinating with different levels of governments, and we look forward to the introduction of additional trade-in subsidizing measures that will directly benefit Chinese consumers. [Foreign language] Meanwhile, at JD, we have collaborated with over 100 brands, including the top brands like Haier Media, Gree, and so on, to launch a trading alliance for household appliances and home goods. And this alliance has so far launched a trade-in subsidizing promotions in 20 cities and regions across China, with the goal of offering more cost saving-and hassle-free trade-in services to consumers nationwide. [Foreign language] At JD.com, we've also been building and refining our trading service capabilities and leveraging our strengths in supply chain, logistics, and services. We continuously elevate the trading service experience to new heights. So, we introduced integrated one-stop trading service, which includes free doorstep pickup, dismantling, handling of the old goods, and free delivery and installation of new goods, etc. And moreover, there are no restrictions on the treating items, original purchase channel, brand, age, or condition. So, with these offerings, JD has shortened the treating process no more than two times of user home visits. So, this is a very unique strength we can provide our services to our users because we're not only having retail services, but also logistic services. And on the back end, we have also done a lot of work over the years to provide the systematic support. So, all of these infrastructures and abilities enable us to provide such a seamless treating services to our consumers today. [Foreign language] So since 2023, more than 16 million users have chosen JD to trade in their old appliances for new ones. And the first time users of our trading service has also recorded a 200% year-on-year increase [Foreign language] So, in 2023, a trading program accounted for mid to high single-digit percentage of JD's home appliances sales. And with the government actively promoting this initiative this year, we anticipate more incremental sales to our home appliances category. And this trading-driven sales are expected to comprise a higher percentage of our overall sales in this category. [Foreign language] At FMCG question, so, first of all, I want to share from the consumption trend standpoint, the overall FMCG sector maintains positive growth momentum. According to the Q1 MBS data, FMCG categories, particularly basic living goods, have shown robust growth. And FMCG and fresh produce are the two sectors that enjoy a rapid increase that enjoy rising sales, whereas they have relatively low online penetration. So, we've seen a lot of online platform and e-commerce players. We are steadily capturing market share from traditional offline markets. [Foreign language]And in light of JD's Q1 data, the anticipated swift rebound of FMCG played a significant role in driving the overall growth of our general merchandise sales and revenues, leading to our general merchandise growth rate outperforming the corresponding industry growth released by MBS. [Foreign language] And in terms of our strategies for the supermarket categories, we've seen significant enhancements in this category as we delve in deeper into each subcategory to enrich product offerings and reduce procurement costs and passing on the benefits to our consumers. And additionally, to address user demand and consumption pain points, we are exploring various measures such as the open sourcing of products, customize the development of new products to provide consumers with high-quality products, competitive prices, and excellent services. [Foreign language] So at the same time, our logistic fulfillment network reform has also empowered us to lower the threshold for free shipping and tailored to the characteristics of different product categories. We are undertaking fulfillment network reforms. As JD's business scale and category mix have evolved significantly over the past years, we've adjusted the algorithm and design of fulfillment network every few years. So, for instance, our unique city-based warehouse model offers a superior shopping experience compared to the industrywide, sending nationwide from one place model. However, our city-based warehouse model requires us to improve scale efficiency, to reduce parcel moving times from one place to another, and reduce the delivery distances through algorithm upgrades, and thereby continuously reducing overall fulfillment costs. [Foreign language] So, all in all, we believe the essence to continue to promote the growth of the supermarket category is to return to the essence of retail, which is to focus on the better cost efficiency and users experience. So, looking ahead, so despite, fierce competition in the supermarket categories and the industry players adopting various strategies, we remain confident in the growth potential of this category and to view the supermarket category as the crucial driver of our overall growth. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Kenneth Fong with UBS. Please go ahead.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Hi, Sandy, Ian, Sean. [Foreign language] Thank you, management, for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one on content. J.D. has been trying different means on the e-commerce content that have been very innovative and differentiating [Inaudible] like merchandise, live streaming, and recently Richard's AI live streaming. We see very positive results. Can management share with us the progress and upcoming strategy for content investment into our core e-commerce platform? And my second question is about shareholder return. We have substantially stepped up shareholder return and repurchased 1.2 billion worth of shares last quarter. How should we think about the pay scale and sustainability of the buyback going forward? Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] So, thank you Kenny. Let me share some thoughts on live streaming and content ecosystem. So, for JD Retail, we announced our commitment to strengthen our content ecosystem at the beginning of the year, aiming to offer users more diverse and comprehensive content experience alongside our superior shopping experience because we believe that by offering a premium content, we attract new traffic to our JD's platform and reduce our users acquisition costs and benefit our platform ecosystem. And we also believe that rich content also play a crucial role in increasing user engagement and time spent on our platform, and consequently enhancing our traffic distribution, efficiency, and conversion rates. [Foreign language] So, our attempt on live streaming as was mentioned with the popular sessions led by our category managers during the Singles Day Grand Promotion and our recent showcases featuring an AI digital representative of our founder, Richard, exemplify our commitment to content innovation, leveraging our JD's technological capabilities. And notably, Richard's avatar live streaming, which marks the industry's first live streaming hosted by an AI avatar of an entrepreneur, drew over 20 million views within the first hour, which also showcases our AI and other capabilities and these applications in the e-commerce scenarios. So, moving forward, we will persist in making technological investments centered on JD's core business, including our large language model, etc. [Foreign language] So, we're still at the early stage of our content ecosystem building. And we hope to provide greater exposure and more traffic to high quality and original content and its creators, so thereby adding value to our consumers by helping them discover products and to make informed shopping decisions.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] And so, thank you. To answer your question on the shareholders returns, I would like to draw your attention, our three-year plan for the $3 billion plan. And so far, we still have around $2.3 billion we scheduled in the years ahead. And year to date, we repurchased a total of 98.3 million class A shares -- ordinary shares equivalent to 49 million ADS for a total of 1.3 billion in open markets from both Nasdaq and Hong Kong, accounting for approximately 3.1% of the total ordinary shares outstanding at the end of 2023. [Foreign language] So, in the long term, our returns will focus on our sustainable, healthy business growth, profitability, and dividends, share buybacks, etc. So, we will continue to reward our shareholders through various means in sharing the success of JD's business.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Next question, please.OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst [Foreign language] Thanks, management, for taking my questions. My first question is about industry and industry competition. How should we think about [Inaudible] and also, how we should think about the industry landscape. How is it different versus this year? My number two question is about ecosystem strategy, the management comments about the number of 3P merchants, as well as contribution in the coming quarters. Thank you.Sandy Xu -- Chief Executive Officer [Foreign language] So, thank you, Thomas. Let me share some plans of the upcoming JD 618 grand promotion. So, this year's grand promotions theme is quality and affordability. We've noticed a trend in the market where many low-priced products appear identical. So, as we continue to implement our low-price strategy, our focus for this year's shopping festival is to highlight JD's ability to offer differentiated, good products at inexpensive price with excellent service. [Foreign language] And this promotion approach and pace will have some difference from the previous years, and all arrangements will be centered on enhancing user experience. And the event will kick off at 8 p.m. on May 31st, with products readily available for immediate purchase. [Foreign language] And we will also remain committed to cultivating strong partnerships with our brands and the suppliers to further solidifying JD's market presence and users mindshare. And we will also set efforts to support SME merchants and to support more than double the number of merchants to achieving over 1 million sales and to support more partners to achieve their growth objectives. [Foreign language] So, overall, we are optimistic about the overall performance for this year's 618 promotion. And we believe that for different market players, we have different strategies in the everyday sales and during the grand promotions. What makes JD stand out is still our advantages in supply chain and the reliability we can offer to our users. [Foreign language] So, we firmly believe that JD's business model, based on robust supply chain and user-centric experience is resilient and sustainable across various economic cycles, and we're confident in our ability to consistently gain market share over the long term with this business model. Thank you.OperatorWe are now --Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Sorry, we haven't been to the second part of Thomas question.Ian Shan -- Chief Financial Officer [Foreign language] To address the question about the platform ecosystem, so our initial focus is to expanding our ecosystem scale by attracting merchants. We are actively working on onboarding more merchants and support them in improving their business performance on our platform by offering a diverse range of products on our platform to our customers. And over the past year, we've successfully attracted a significant number of new merchants by continuously streamlining our onboarding processes, reducing their store operating costs, improving operational efficiencies, and providing traffic support. So, in this quarter, the number of active merchants on our platform exceeded 1 million, with the number of active merchants experiencing accelerated growth for four consecutive quarters. And admittedly, our merchant count may not be as high as some other platforms, and we remain committed to further enhancing our merchant recruitment efforts and supporting their activities on our platform, and we anticipate continued growth in the number of merchants in the following quarters. [Foreign language] So, for the second phase of the platform ecosystem building involves encouraging user participation. Ultimately, we aim for it to become a natural process, a natural choice for our users to purchase either self-operated or third-party products. Thus far, we've observed the favorable interactions between our users and third party offerings. In Q1, we achieved accelerated growth in both 3P transaction users and 3P order volume. Meanwhile, NPS for 3P has continued to improve. Since the second half of last year, we've been collaborating with our merchants to pioneer service innovations. This has led to the implementation of services like late delivery compensation, refund-only policies, and free doorstep pickup for returns and more services, all of which have constantly elevated our shopping experience for our top users. [Foreign language] And lastly, we also believe that we will witness an increase in pop sales and revenues. And the prerequisites for this to happen is that we can truly help our merchants to scale up their businesses. From the rapid expansion of merchant members, to active user participation, and to rapid growth of pop GMV, all of this will require time and patience. With the gradual improvement of our platform ecosystem in the long run, the proportion of our 3P orders and GMV will eventually surpass that of our self-operated products. And this will also be a natural choice by our users. [Foreign language] Leveraging our 1P business and the collaboration with merchants from our 3P marketplace, we are able to foster a thriving platform ecosystem and providing richer supplies of high-quality goods and to increase the engagement of our users on our platform so as to achieve a virtuous cycle. And we believe this virtuous cycle will be an important driver for the continued growth of our long-term revenues and profits. Thank you.Sean Zhang -- Director of Investor Relations Thank you, operator. So, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thanks for your question. If you have further question, please contact me and our team. We appreciate your interest in JD.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's IR website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Robin. Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hello, everyone. Our business continued to grow in the first quarter. Baidu Core's total revenue increased by 4% year over year to RMB 23.8 billion, and the non-GAAP operating margin reached 23.5% an improvement from a year ago. In particular, revenue growth from Baidu AI cloud accelerated to 12% year over year in the quarter while continuing to deliver operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. 2024 is the second year of our march on the GenAI path. As we solidify our leadership position in foundation models, we are transforming the company from an Internet-centric business to an AI-first business. Given that ERNIE is the most powerful LLM in China, we are aggressively pushing the envelope for both our 2C business and 2B business to adopt ERNIE, to provide better user experience, to increase advertiser ROI, to enable developers to write agents and applications to let customers enjoy more effective and more efficient models. While we operate our legacy business in a challenging environment and experience lower revenue growth in the near term, we remain confident that AI will bring us sustained growth in revenue and profit in the long run. We expect our cloud business to accelerate and the loss of our Robotaxi business to narrow for the rest of the year. We expect mobile business to be soft in the near term and start to recover when GenAI becomes the new core of our existing products next year. Looking beyond the near term, GenAI and foundation models will bring us tremendous opportunities, offering a new innovation cycle. Enterprise and individual developers have swiftly transitioned from the fear of missing out on this opportunity to leveraging foundation models like ERNIE to build AI applications. Baidu is well prepared to benefit greatly from this technology transformation. We believe one of the most important long-term opportunities is model inferencing which will be a key growth driver for our AI cloud revenue in the future. In April, ERNIE handled about 200 million API costs daily, a significant jump from around 50 million in December last year. This considerable growth indicates the increasing adoption of ERNIE and points to strong future revenue potential from model inferencing. To accelerate the adoption of ERNIE, we are building a vibrant and healthy ecosystem around it. We believe ERNIE ecosystem will over time, contain millions of applications, especially agents developed by a diverse community of enterprise and individual developers across various industries meeting a wide range of needs in people's everyday life and work. Our large user base in mobile and desktop will enable us to distribute these agents and apps to whoever needs it, whenever appropriate. The anchor of this ecosystem is the ERNIE family of models, including our flagship models, ERNIE 3.5 and ERNIE 4.0., as well as the lightweight models we introduced in Q1. Throughout the quarter, we continued improving ERNIE's efficiency, leveraging our unique proprietary four-layer AI architecture and our strong ability in end-to-end optimization. For example, ERNIE has increased its training efficiency to 5.1 times, and its inference cost is only about 1% compared to the March 2023 version. To make ERNIE increasingly accessible and affordable, we now offer three sets of tools on our MaaS platform. Last quarter, we introduced AppBuilder and ModelBuilder for enterprise and individual developers to develop apps and build models. In April, we took a step further by introducing AgentBuilder, a platform encompassing tools for easily creating AI agents. This is because we envision AI agent will become one of the most important forms of applications powered by GenAI and foundation models. With the ability to use natural language as the programming language, developers will be able to build AI agents without the need to write a single line of code. Currently, new ERNIE agents are created on our platform every day, and together, they are distributed millions of times per day, serving a wide range of verticals including education, legal, B2B, travel, and more. All these initiatives derive from our extensive experience and insights in building and running ERNIE, as well as developing AI native applications. We believe that ERNIE's true value will only be realized when numerous applications built on top of it are widely used by users and customers. I'm pleased to note that ERNIE is extending its influence across smart devices through API. Last quarter, we proudly announced the partnerships with renowned smartphone brands such as Samsung China and Honor, assisting them in enhancing their native app experiences using ERNIE. This quarter, we are excited to extend our collaboration with more leading smartphone makers such as Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, who leveraged ERNIE APIs to elevate user experiences. Moreover, our reach now extends beyond smartphones to include PCs and electric vehicles. ERNIE APIs are now utilized by Lenovo, a top PC brand, to empower its AI assistant in the default browser of its PCs. Nio, China's leading smart EV manufacturer began using the ERNIE API to enhance the encamping experiences for its vehicles. This broadening of our partnerships into various smart devices opens up ample opportunities for large-scale user adoption, paving the way for ERNIE-enabled applications to become the entry point into the world of generative AI. In addition to the brands I just mentioned, we have also acquired many notable new customers such as Trip.com, [Inaudible] and Singapore Tourism Board. Another long-term opportunity is in our consumer-facing business. We have been reconstructing all of our consumer-facing products. Our goal is to build our proprietary AI-native applications, potentially killer apps for the ERNIE ecosystem. By doing so, we should be able to generate new growth opportunities. For example, after rebuilding with GenAI and LLMs, Baidu Wenku, our one-stop shop for document creation, experienced double-digit year-over-year increase in paying users in the first quarter. Penetration of ERNIE for Baidu search and feed took longer than expected because the user base is in the order of hundreds of millions, and use cases are generally very sensitive to cost and response time. We need a wide range of ERNIE models in different sizes, optimized for different scenarios for best price performance ratio. After trial and error for a few quarters, we are firming up our strategy. Going forward, we plan to accelerate the launch and adoption of new product features such as multimodal generative search results, multi-round interaction in search, and more recently, distribution of ERNIE agents. We are at the forefront globally of this unique technological change, and we are confident in our abilities to innovate. By definition, we are operating in uncharted territory. As always, we want to be flexible to make timely adjustments with evolving consumer needs and how users incorporate new product features in their day-to-day life. Now, let me review the key highlights for each business for the first quarter. In the first quarter, AI cloud revenue reached RMB 4.7 billion, up 12% year over year, and continued to generate operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. The revenue growth was mainly driven by GenAI and foundation models. In the first quarter, such revenue accounted for 6.9% of total AI cloud revenue. Currently, the majority of this revenue is from model training, but revenue from model inferencing has been growing quickly. We believe revenue from GenAI and foundation models will continue to rise as customer adoption improves. For instance, within our internal cloud revenue Baidu Core, other business groups, such as mobile ecosystem groups and intelligent driving group are increasingly leveraging the power of ERNIE. As a result, 15% of their payments to the AI cloud group are allocated to GenAI and foundation model. Enterprises choose Baidu AI cloud to train and host their models because they believe we have the most powerful and efficient AI infrastructure for model training and inferencing in China. Compared to our peers, we help enterprises to train model at all sizes on our AI cloud while also reducing model inferencing cost. This is primarily attributable to two reasons. Number one, our self-developed four-layer AI architecture has allowed us to innovate and optimize at each layer, enabling continuous efficiency gain. And number two, we have superior capabilities and insights in GPU cluster management. Leveraging our technical expertise, we can now integrate GPUs from various vendors into a unified computing cluster to train an LLM. Our platform has demonstrated very high efficiency with this setup on a GPU cluster that is composed of hundreds, even thousands of GPUs. This is an important breakthrough because of the limited availability of imported GPUs. Another growth driver for AI cloud is cross-selling of our CPU cloud services to our GPU cloud customers. With the high recognition of our GPU cloud among existing and new customers, we have seen customers increasingly switch more and more of their CPU cloud usage to Baidu. As I mentioned earlier on the MaaS side, we took many initiatives to make the ERNIE family of models increasingly affordable and efficient than open-sourced models. Here are some highlights for this quarter. We have expanded and enhanced our ERNIE model portfolio, offering a total of three lightweight LLMs and two test-specific LLMs, ModelBuilder. This model helps enterprises and professional developers balance model performance with cost in ERNIE to reach a broader audience for model development. In addition, our mixture of experts, or MOE approach, can position a user query into distinct tasks, assigning the most suitable models to handle each task and use ERNIE 3.5 or 4.0 only for the most complex tasks. This approach allows for faster responses and lower inferencing cost, while maintaining similar performance level to using more advanced models. Last quarter, we introduced AppBuilder to developers. Throughout the quarter, we continued in reaching and refining the tools for AppBuilder, enabling developers to easily create AI-native apps in just three steps on our platform. With the launch of AgentBuilder in April, anyone can create an AI agent with just a few sentences on Baidu. Overall, we remain confident in the strong for our AI cloud revenue, and we aim to continue generating operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. Mobile ecosystem has continued to deliver healthy margins and strong free cash flow. In the first quarter, our online marketing revenue grew by 3% year over year. Revenue growth was impacted by a challenging macro environment. At the same time, we have been pushing hard to transform the user experience from a traditional mobile product to a generative AI experience. This transition is ongoing and monetization has not yet started. We also continued to leverage ERNIE to reconstruct our monetization system for better conversion and efficiency gain. During the quarter, we further enhanced our ad-targeting capabilities and scaled up real-time ad generation. These efforts resulted in an improvement in conversion and generated incremental revenue. ERNIE agents stand for a long-term opportunity for monetization upgrade, too. Recently, we have seen, not only brand advertisers, but also SMEs gradually adopting ERNIE agents. We have designed this agents for SMEs as virtual storefront and service desk, serving consumers around the clock. We believe that the use of agents can improve SME's sell-through rate, enhance their productivity, and expand their reach among users. This will be an important step for us to transform our traditional CPC model to a significantly more efficient CPS model and, meanwhile, enhancing user experience on Baidu. Going forward, I believe greater opportunities will arise from AI-native apps, particularly for GenAI-enabled Baidu Search. GenAI complements traditional search, expanding the total addressable market. Since Q2 last year, we have been reconstructing Baidu Search with ERNIE. Now, more and more search results are generated by ERNIE in a growing variety of formats like text, image, third-party links, point of interest, and citation. These results are usually produced in real time to directly address users' questions and problems. By doing so, we have improved and will continue to enhance the search experience which is crucial for increasing the usage of Baidu Search. While user feedback on this product and feature renovations has been encouraging, it is important to note that we are still in the early stages of reconstructing Baidu Search with ERNIE. This process will likely take time given that Baidu Search has a history spanning over 20 years, and user behavior will evolve gradually. Overall, I believe that search will be one most likely killer app in the GenAI era, and we are on the right trajectory to capitalize on this potential. I mentioned ERNIE agents as an important opportunity for monetization. With newly introduced AgentBuilder, creators, publishers, and service providers will find it increasingly easy to build agents on Baidu. This initiative is key to enhancing Baidu's content offerings and ultimately provide an AI-native user experience on our platform. Moving on to intelligent driving. We believe Apollo Go stands as the largest autonomous ride-hailing service provider globally, measured by the ride provided to the public. In the first quarter, Apollo Go offered about 826,000 rides to the public, marking a 25% year-over-year increase. In April, the total number of rides surpassed 6 million. We are continuing to move forward -- move toward achieving unit economics breakeven for Apollo Go. To make this happen, our strategy is to reach UE breakeven in key regions and then replicate the success in other regions. To reach the regional breakeven point, we are focusing on scaling up the operations of fully driverless ride-hailing service and enhance the utilization of each vehicle. Wuhan, Apollo Go's largest regional operations, is progressing toward this goal. In Wuhan, Apollo Go is gradually becoming an integral part of the city's transportation network. Apollo Go more than doubled its operational area from a quarter ago, serving a population of over 7 million and achieving the remarkable milestone of crossing Yangtze River with fully driverless vehicles as part of its expansion. Moreover, our vehicles started to operate 24/7 in Wuhan in early March, further expanding Apollo Go's reach and improving the vehicle utilization. All these progresses have led to the rapid growth of fully driverless rides. In Q1, the rides provided by fully driverless vehicles accounted for over 55% of total rides in Wuhan, which is up from 45% in the fourth quarter last year. This figure continues to rise, exceeding 70% in April, with expectations of sustained rapid growth ahead and reaching 100% in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy RT6, our sixth generation Robotaxi in our Wuhan Apollo Go operation this year which will significantly reduce hardware depreciation costs. With the scaling of driverless operations and continuous improvement of cost structure, we believe Apollo Go will achieve operational UE breakeven in Wuhan in the near future. As Apollo Go continues to progress, we will closely monitor efficiency and persist in optimizing the operation of our overall intelligent driving business. On auto solutions, our Apollo self-driving for ASD technology continue to evolve. I mentioned in our last earnings call that Apollo is a global pioneer in the use of visual foundation models in autonomous driving. Now, our state-of-the-art autonomous driving solution, solely reliant on vision, is made available to OEMs. ASD can effectively navigate complex, urban environments across over 100 cities in China with plans to expand in to hundreds of cities in the coming months. This allows us to make advanced autonomous driving attainable across a broad spectrum of passenger vehicles from high-end to economy models priced as low as 150,000 RMB, and it serves as another proof of our technology leadership. With that, let me turn the call over to Rong to go through the financial results.Rong Luo -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Robin. Now, let me walk through the details of our first-quarter financial results. Total revenues were RMB 31.5 billion, increasing 1% year over year. Revenue from Baidu Core was RMB 23.8 billion, increasing 4% year over year. Baidu Core's online marketing revenue was RMB 17 billion, 1-7, increasing 3% year over year. Baidu Core's non-online marketing revenue was RMB 6.8 billion, up 6% year over year, mainly driven by the AI cloud business. Revenue for iQIYI was RMB 7.9 billion, decreasing 5% year over year. Cost of revenue was RMB 15.3 billion, increasing 1% year over year, primarily due to an increase in traffic acquisition costs and costs related to AI cloud business partially offset by the decrease in content costs. Operating expenses were RMB 10.7 billion, decreasing 2% year over year, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses and other R&D expenditures, partially offset by the increase in server depreciation expenses and server custody fees, which support GenAI research and development inputs. Baidu Core's operating expenses were RMB 9.4 billion, decreasing 1% year over year. Baidu Core SG&A expenses were RMB 4.5 billion, decreasing 1% year over year. SG&A accounting for 19%, 1-9, of Baidu Core's revenue in this quarter compared to 20% in the same period last year. Baidu Core R&D expenses were RMB 4.9 billion, decreasing 1% year over year. R&D accounting for 21% of Baidu Core's revenue in this quarter compared to 22% in the same period last year. Operating income was RMB 5.5 billion. Baidu Core's operating income was RMB 4.5 billion, and Baidu Core's operating margin was 19%, 1-9, and non-GAAP operating income was RMB 6.7 billion. Non-GAAP Baidu Core operating income was RMB 5.6 billion, and non-GAAP Baidu Core operating margin was 23.5%. Total other income net was RMB 2 billion, decreasing 52% year over year, primarily due to a decrease in favorable gain from long-term investments, partially offset by the increase in net foreign exchange gain. Income tax expenses was RMB 883 million, compared to RMB 1.2 billion in the same period last year. Net income attributable to Baidu was RMB 5.4 billion, and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB 14.91. Net income attributable to Baidu Core RMB 5.2 billion, and net margin for Baidu Core was 22%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu was RMB 7 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB 19.91. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu Core was RMB 6.6 billion, and non-GAAP net margin for Baidu Core was 28%. As of March 31st, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was RMB 191.8 billion. And cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments excluding iQIYI were RMB 185.8 billion. Free cash flow was RMB 4.2 billion. And free cash flow excluding iQIYI was RMB 3.3 billion. Finally, Baidu Core had approximately 36,000 employees as of March 31st, 2024. With that, operator, let's now open the call to questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Alicia Yap with Citigroup.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you. Good evening Robin, Rong, and also -- sorry. So, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask, were you able to quantify how has AI technology been helping Baidu to improve app monetization rate? Can management share some feedback on those advertisers who have adopted this system? In what kind of areas do they see the largest improvements, and are there any areas that can be further enhanced? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Alicia. This is Robin. As you know, our monetization system was the first to benefit from GenAI, generating several hundred million RMB per quarter in incremental revenue. Since the second half of last year, we have been utilizing ERNIE to upgrade our monetization system, enhancing various aspects of ad technology. This includes -- including adding capabilities, refining the options system, automating creative generation, and add strategy formation for our advertisers. Advertisers have been seeing better conversion and more sales leads. This improvement has motivated advertisers to increase their spending with Baidu. So, in the first quarter, AI-related incremental advertising revenue grew on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we expect this trend to continue. The incremental revenue has helped us mitigate the broader macro weakness and also bought us some time to reconstruct our user product with ERNIE. As I emphasized in my opening remarks, we believe ERNIE agent offers a significant long-term opportunity for our online marketing business. Agents function as virtual stores or domains. Advertisers can establish their online presence and interact with potential customers using natural language through multi-round conversations. With the introduction of AgentBuilder, advertisers can easily create customized ERNIE agents. When advertisers express their intentions to these agents, they can more effectively achieve their goals, whether it's helping potential customers understand their products or improving customer service quality. Agents can also help enrich our content offering and improve user experience on Baidu. While still in early stage, ERNIE agents have helped some advertisers achieve better ROIs. For example, we have a customer in online education. They used AgentBuilder to create its AI agent, injecting it with key insights like product introduction and subject matter expertise, while continually providing feedback for refinement. This agent has significantly enhanced the company's online customer service by offering round the clock high-quality consultations. The adoption of ERNIE agent led to a 20% increase in ad conversion rate for this online education company. I think this is just the beginning. We believe agent will be a major form of content and services in the new AI era. We will continue to improve the capabilities of ERNIE Agent. Agents will not only elevate user experience, both conversion and ROI for advertisers, but also, over time, foster increase in transactions directly generated on our platform. This shift should help us to transform our tradition CPC model into a more efficient CPS model. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Gary Yu with Morgan Stanley.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Thank you, management, for the opportunity to ask questions. I have a question regarding AI cloud business. How has the price cut initiative by some of your peer companies affected Baidu AI cloud business, and how should we think about the cloud revenue profitability as competition heats up, and also how should we -- what should be the sustainable level of cloud growth outlook going forward? Thank you.Dou Shen -- Executive Vice President, AI Cloud Group ACG Yeah, Gary. This is Dou. As we have already mentioned, GenAI and foundation models are transforming the cloud industry from general purpose computing to AI computing. So, this shift is reshaping the competitive landscape within the cloud industry, presenting us with the valuable opportunity to establish ourselves as a leader in AI cloud. We believe we offer China's most efficient AI infrastructure and most advanced MaaS platform for model training and inference. As a result, more and more enterprises are choosing us for model training, fine-tuning, and AI-native app development on our public cloud. This increasing demand has significantly boosted our AI cloud revenue. Actually, since the second quarter, the second half of last year, our AI cloud revenue growth has started to accelerate from a year-over-year decline in the third quarter to an 11% increase in the fourth quarter last year, and then further accelerated to 12% in the first quarter this year. The revenue acceleration was supported by two main factors: the incremental revenue directly generated by GenAI and foundation models, and also the new opportunities they provide to our legacy cloud business. As Robin just mentioned, in the first quarter of this year, revenue from GenAI and foundation models accounts for 6.9 of our AI cloud revenue. And then our traditional CPU cloud businesses were capitalizing on the opportunities presented by GenAI and foundation models. Both factors were important growth drivers of our AI cloud. On a separate note, while the smart transportation business remained subdued, its impact on overall AI cloud business in Q1 was substantially smaller than the previous quarters. So, overall, we expect our AI cloud to continue benefiting from the trend to maintain strong revenue growth momentum in the upcoming quarters. On the profit side, Baidu AI cloud continued to generate non-GAAP operating profit as we have seen in previous quarters. We are committed to sustainable and healthy revenue growth. During the quarter, we maintained our focus on achieving high-quality revenue growth by scaling down low-margin business. Regarding the business of GenAI and foundation models, the market is still at a very early stage, so our focus remains on educating the market and broadening our footprint across more enterprises. Looking to the long run, we expect the normalized margin for GenAI and foundational models related business to improve further and to be higher than our traditional cloud business. Regarding the change of pricing policies of some competitors that you just mentioned, it is actually pretty common for cloud vendors to adjust their pricing for certain products. This is a trend we have observed multiple times in the past. Given that our cloud offering has expanded beyond traditional CPU cloud to a high-value AI product and services, the industry changes on CPU cloud pricing has a minimum impact of the development of our AI cloud. Actually for cloud platform services, by leveraging our unique proprietary four-layer AI architecture and our strong ability in end-to-end automation, we have lowered ERNIE's inference cost to only 1% over the variant in March last year. This May, ERNIE handles about 200 million API calls or approximately 250 billion tokens daily. We are confident that ERNIE's expanding adoption will continue to enhance its performance, boosting efficiency, and then further reduce costs. It's also important to evaluate price and performance ratio for different models at different workloads, rather than just focusing solely on some superficial prices. We believe our state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and advanced MaaS platform delivers the best value to our customers. Looking forward, leveraging our strong AI capabilities, we aim to continuously attract new customers and encourage existing ones to increase their spending on Baidu AI cloud. At the same time, we aim to consistently generate positive non-GAAP operating profit. Thank you, Gary.OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Yao with JPMorgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi, good evening, management, and thank you for taking our question. Given the chip shortage in China, how does Baidu maintain its commitment to deliver differentiated value while enhancing its leading advantage in LLM technology in China? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Alex. We do think very differently in this aspect. We are taking an application-driven approach for our AI push. For example, solving all the high school math problems using the most advanced LLM may not be the highest priority at this time, while generating convincing reasons for users to buy the right products is more important in a lot of applications. With that in mind, we are taking advantage of our unique four-layer AI tech stack to optimize the cost and performance of ERNIE models, and we make sure customers and developers can easily build applications using tools like AgentBuilder, AppBuilder, and ModelBuilder. For the AI infrastructure layer, a key factor contributing to our high efficiency in model training and inference is our superior capability in GPU cluster management. We have recently made a breakthrough by integrating GPUs from different vendors into one large scale, unified computing cluster, allowing us to use less-advanced chips for highly effective model training and inference. Our deep learning framework, PaddlePaddle, has been through continuous innovation and enhancement, helped reduce the cost of model training and inferencing on a constant basis. PaddlePaddle is compatible with over 50 different chips, many domestically designed, and the developer community has grown to 13 million. With ERNIE 3.5 and ERNIE 4.0 remain to be the flagship models for sophisticated tasks, we're making ERNIE more accessible and affordable by launching lightweight LLMs, introducing a toolkits for model development and app development, applying MOE approach for model inference for better performance and lower cost. With our application-driven mindset, we have used ERNIE extensively to renovate our own products, and we have gained experience and insights in training and using ERNIE, as well as developing AI-native applications on it. We're making all these capabilities available to our customers and developers. With all these efforts, we are fostering a vibrant and healthy ecosystem around ERNIE. We can see that we are actually taking a holistic approach to developing GenAI and LLM, which is very different from some of our competitors. Our reserve and access to the chips on the market should be sufficient for us to support millions of AI applications in the future. And in the long run, I think China will form an ecosystem of its own, probably with less powerful chips but most efficient homegrown software stack. There is ample room for innovation in the application layer, model layer, and framework layer. With ourselves developing a four-layer AI infrastructure, as well as our strong R&D team, our dedication to AI and our application-driven approach in building an ecosystem around ERNIE, I'm quite confident that Baidu will stand as a leader in China's AI ecosystem in the long term. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Lincoln Kong with Goldman Sachs.Lincoln Kong -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you, management, for taking my question. My question is about the advertising business. So, what's the major drag for the advertising growth if we compare it with our peers? So, what are the trends we have seen for advertising budgets and advertiser sentiment, especially into second quarter April and May? How should we think about normalized advertising growth for 2024? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, our online marketing revenue grew by 3% year over year in the first quarter. While traditional search is maturing, we are working hard to renovate the user experience with GenAI. Right now, about 11% of our search result pages are filled with generated results. These results provide more accurate, better organized, and direct answers to users' questions and, in some cases, enable users to do things they could not do before. We have not started the monetization of those GenAI results, so it will take some time for revenue to catch up. And the weak macro also contributed to the softness of our ad business. Our advertisers come from a wide range of industries with the majority being SMEs. This makes our advertising revenue highly sensitive to the macro environment, particularly to the offline economy. In the first quarter, advertiser sentiment in some verticals, such as real estate and franchising, remained weak. Specifically in the real estate industry, not only was ad spending from developers and agencies muted, but the impact also extended to both upstream and downstream sectors. For example, energy, chemicals, machinery, building materials for upstream and home renovation, furniture, which is kind of downstream, all saw constrained ad spending on our platform. Also, many SMEs in offline sectors need more time to recover as they have been hit hard in the past few years. As we enter the second quarter, we have not seen improvement in advertiser sentiment. Given the limited visibility for sentiment improvement and paired with tough comps in Q2, our online marketing revenue should remain fundamentally solid, but from a growth perspective, soft over the next few quarters. Beyond the near-term challenges, we expect online marketing to remain a bread-and-butter business for Baidu for the foreseeable future. Search is one of the most popular apps in the internet age, and Baidu remains the largest search engine in China with close to 700 million MAUs. Search will likely be one of the killer apps in the age of GenAI. Technology innovation will enable us to better engage users with developers and merchants, directly connect users' intentions with the most relevant product and service offering in more natural ways. Yeah. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, good evening. Thanks management for taking my questions. My question is about how much more room do we see in cost cutting? Previously, you mentioned there will be a lag between the investment and AI revenue contribution. How should we look at margin trends in 2024 if you intend to expand your AI offering? Thank you.Rong Luo -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Thomas. Thanks so much for your question. I think our macro challenges are still weighing on our marketing businesses, but we are confident that there still will be some ways for us to continue optimizing the operational efficiency. We will stringently manage our cost expenses for each businesses, and we will take some further steps as necessary, including we'll try to streamline the organization structures to enhance the agility and support strategy flexibility. And we also will reallocate resources to prioritize the key structure areas. If I take a look into our businesses, for mobile ecosystem, I think we can still manage the costs and expenses. So, mobile ecosystem group continues to remain strongly profitable and cash-flow positive. For AI cloud, as Dou just mentioned, we will continue to phase out low-margin businesses and products, so we can continue generating the operating profits and margins on a non-GAAP basis. If we're looking to longer term, the normalized margin for the GenAI related cloud businesses should be higher than the legacy cloud businesses. For other businesses, we aim to reduce our loss, as we talked about in the past few quarters, particularly our intelligent driving business with more operational efficiency gains and UI improvements for Robotaxi. Many investors ask me how our investments in ERNIE will impact net margins. In fact, our reinvestments are mainly related to capex for model training and inference. In 2023, we made a large purchase which has arrived at different times and the different depreciation start dates. While the annualized depreciation expenses will be available in the whole year 2024, the impact on our overall cost expenses and quarterly earnings is quite predictable and manageable. The depreciation expenses book under R&D expenses for computing power use and training, and the cost of revenue for computing power reduced for model inference and business expenses. In the first quarter, we can see that Baidu Core's non-GAAP R&D and the cost of revenue both increased very slightly, while non-GAAP operating margin actually we have expanded to 23.5% due to disciplined spending on other items such as SG&A. We believe that the chips we have in hand are sufficient to support training of ERNIE for the next one or two years. And because of the limited availability of high-performance chips in China in this year, 2024, we expect our capex to be smaller versus last year. In conclusion, the investments in GenAI and large language models will have a manageable impact on the near-term margins, and with our monetization of earnings already taking off, we expect that more and more revenue and profit will be generated from that kind of business, for both mobile ecosystem and AI cloud. Overall, we believe that high-quality growth and investment should be very balanced. For many years now, we have delivered a solid track record of top-line growth with very resolute cost discipline, and we intend to continue building our future on this kind of business. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from [Inaudible] with UBS.Unknown speaker Good evening. Thanks, management, for taking our question. My question is about shareholder return. So, how about should we think about the execution pace of the current 5 billion buyback program in addition to your current buyback program? Should we expect other diversified approach to improve shareholder return? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks so much for your questions. I think we highly value our shareholders, and we have been making efforts to increase the shareholder returns. We have consistently repurchased our shares from the market over the past four years, averaging around $1 billion annually. In total, we have allocated around 37% of our free cash flow toward the share buyback progress. I think during these period and going forward, we will continue to buy back more shares from the market as we believe in our long-term growth opportunities, and we are very committed to the shareholder returns. And in addition, we have utilized our current share repurchase program to prevent any significant increase in the total outstanding share count, aiming to reduce the potential dilution of our shareholders' economic stake in Baidu. In the year 2023, you can see that our total number of shares outstanding was flat year over year compared to a 1.2% increase in the year 2022 and a 3.2% increase in the year 2021. In this quarter, the total shares outstanding began to decrease. We can see that it has been declining by 0.5% as compared to the prior quarters. We are adopting a strategy of sustainable and recurring share buyback programs for the open market and, at the same time, we are taking into consideration the opportunities ahead of us. Now, we are facing a huge opportunity in GenAI and foundation models, and we have structured a concrete plan to capitalize it. So, we want to have the flexibility to invest as we consider necessary and in the best interests of long-term value to the shareholders. Furthermore, we believe that the most effective way to create value for shareholders is by building strong base fundamentals. Our core marketing business remains steady, and we believe that AI will help us to build another growth engine over time. Thank you so much for your question.OperatorYour next question comes from Miranda Zhuang with BofA Securities.Miranda Zhuang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. My question is about Robotaxi. So, can management share more updates on the Robotaxi initiatives and the geographic coverage for this year? I think previously you'd mentioned that Apollo Go will achieve operating UE breakeven in Wuhan in the near future. I want to understand what's the logic behind the efforts to continue to improve the UE. What's the projected size of the vehicle fleet for this year, and how will it potentially impact the cost? Thanks.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Miranda. Let me give you some more color on the Robotaxi business. In 2023, Apollo Go made significant progress in improving the regional unit economics in key cities. Let me use Wuhan, Apollo Go's largest operation, to explain how we achieved that. We kicked-off Apollo Go's commercial operations in Wuhan back in 2022. Since then, we've witnessed a consistent enhancement in operational UE, which can be attributed to the expanding scale of driverless operations and decreasing cost per vehicle. Regarding scale expansion, our vehicle fleet has been steadily growing. Compared to one year ago, our fully driverless fleet in Wuhan has grown threefold, reaching about 300 vehicles today. Meanwhile, both the operational area and service hours for our fully driverless operations have been consistently expanding, thanks to the increasing recognition of our autonomous driving technology by the local government. The operational coverage area for our fully driverless ride-hailing service increased by eightfold from a year ago, now covering over 7 million people in Wuhan. Apollo Go's operational hours also gradually expanded from only the off-peak hours in the beginning to adding peak hours to its operations and eventually extending to 24/7 in March of this year. The scale expansion resulted in a consistent improvement of UE in terms of revenue. Both daily rides per vehicle and distance per ride have been growing. When it comes to cost, the majority is labor cost and hardware expenditures. We have been demonstrating consistent track record of safe operations, which helps us to increase deployment of fully driverless ride-hailing operations. In April, the proportion of fully driverless orders rose to 70%. That's up from only 10% in August 2022 and 45% Q4 of last year. We expect this figure to reach 100% in the coming quarters, thereby enabling us to minimize the cost related to safety officers. In addition to lowering the labor cost, we are steadfast in driving down hardware costs. The mass production and timeline of RT6, our sixth-generation Robotaxi, remains on track. Adopting a battery swapping solution, the mass production price for RT6 excluding battery is below $30,000. We will use RT6 as the primary vehicle in the future fleet expansion, and it should help to significantly reduce the hardware depreciation cost for each vehicle, and further improving our UE and bringing us closer to profitability. Looking to this quarter, we plan to expand the fully driverless fleet of our Wuhan operation to 1,000 vehicles by the end of the year, more than tripling from the end of last year. Our focus remains on improving regional UE and narrowing the losses for Apollo Go business. With continued improvement in operational efficiency and cost reduction, we believe Apollo Go will achieve operational UE breakeven in Wuhan first. And once that's achieved, we can scale up the operation quickly. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

      "Baidu (BIDU -1.78%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorHello, and thank you for standing by for Baidu's first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After management's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Juan Lin, Baidu's director of investor relations.Juan Lin -- Director of Investor Relations Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Baidu's earnings release was distributed earlier today, and you can find a copy on our IR website as well as on newswire services. On the call today, we have Robin Li, our co-founder and CEO; Rong Luo, our CFO; and Dou Shen, our EVP in charge of Baidu AI Cloud Group ACG. After our prepared remarks, we will hold a Q&A session.

Our earnings press release and this call include discussions of certain unaudited non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release contains a reconciliation of the unaudited non-GAAP measures to the unaudited most directly comparable GAAP measures and is available on our IR side at ir.baidu.com. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's IR website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Robin. Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hello, everyone. Our business continued to grow in the first quarter. Baidu Core's total revenue increased by 4% year over year to RMB 23.8 billion, and the non-GAAP operating margin reached 23.5% an improvement from a year ago. In particular, revenue growth from Baidu AI cloud accelerated to 12% year over year in the quarter while continuing to deliver operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. 2024 is the second year of our march on the GenAI path. As we solidify our leadership position in foundation models, we are transforming the company from an Internet-centric business to an AI-first business. Given that ERNIE is the most powerful LLM in China, we are aggressively pushing the envelope for both our 2C business and 2B business to adopt ERNIE, to provide better user experience, to increase advertiser ROI, to enable developers to write agents and applications to let customers enjoy more effective and more efficient models. While we operate our legacy business in a challenging environment and experience lower revenue growth in the near term, we remain confident that AI will bring us sustained growth in revenue and profit in the long run. We expect our cloud business to accelerate and the loss of our Robotaxi business to narrow for the rest of the year. We expect mobile business to be soft in the near term and start to recover when GenAI becomes the new core of our existing products next year. Looking beyond the near term, GenAI and foundation models will bring us tremendous opportunities, offering a new innovation cycle. Enterprise and individual developers have swiftly transitioned from the fear of missing out on this opportunity to leveraging foundation models like ERNIE to build AI applications. Baidu is well prepared to benefit greatly from this technology transformation. We believe one of the most important long-term opportunities is model inferencing which will be a key growth driver for our AI cloud revenue in the future. In April, ERNIE handled about 200 million API costs daily, a significant jump from around 50 million in December last year. This considerable growth indicates the increasing adoption of ERNIE and points to strong future revenue potential from model inferencing. To accelerate the adoption of ERNIE, we are building a vibrant and healthy ecosystem around it. We believe ERNIE ecosystem will over time, contain millions of applications, especially agents developed by a diverse community of enterprise and individual developers across various industries meeting a wide range of needs in people's everyday life and work. Our large user base in mobile and desktop will enable us to distribute these agents and apps to whoever needs it, whenever appropriate. The anchor of this ecosystem is the ERNIE family of models, including our flagship models, ERNIE 3.5 and ERNIE 4.0., as well as the lightweight models we introduced in Q1. Throughout the quarter, we continued improving ERNIE's efficiency, leveraging our unique proprietary four-layer AI architecture and our strong ability in end-to-end optimization. For example, ERNIE has increased its training efficiency to 5.1 times, and its inference cost is only about 1% compared to the March 2023 version. To make ERNIE increasingly accessible and affordable, we now offer three sets of tools on our MaaS platform. Last quarter, we introduced AppBuilder and ModelBuilder for enterprise and individual developers to develop apps and build models. In April, we took a step further by introducing AgentBuilder, a platform encompassing tools for easily creating AI agents. This is because we envision AI agent will become one of the most important forms of applications powered by GenAI and foundation models. With the ability to use natural language as the programming language, developers will be able to build AI agents without the need to write a single line of code. Currently, new ERNIE agents are created on our platform every day, and together, they are distributed millions of times per day, serving a wide range of verticals including education, legal, B2B, travel, and more. All these initiatives derive from our extensive experience and insights in building and running ERNIE, as well as developing AI native applications. We believe that ERNIE's true value will only be realized when numerous applications built on top of it are widely used by users and customers. I'm pleased to note that ERNIE is extending its influence across smart devices through API. Last quarter, we proudly announced the partnerships with renowned smartphone brands such as Samsung China and Honor, assisting them in enhancing their native app experiences using ERNIE. This quarter, we are excited to extend our collaboration with more leading smartphone makers such as Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, who leveraged ERNIE APIs to elevate user experiences. Moreover, our reach now extends beyond smartphones to include PCs and electric vehicles. ERNIE APIs are now utilized by Lenovo, a top PC brand, to empower its AI assistant in the default browser of its PCs. Nio, China's leading smart EV manufacturer began using the ERNIE API to enhance the encamping experiences for its vehicles. This broadening of our partnerships into various smart devices opens up ample opportunities for large-scale user adoption, paving the way for ERNIE-enabled applications to become the entry point into the world of generative AI. In addition to the brands I just mentioned, we have also acquired many notable new customers such as Trip.com, [Inaudible] and Singapore Tourism Board. Another long-term opportunity is in our consumer-facing business. We have been reconstructing all of our consumer-facing products. Our goal is to build our proprietary AI-native applications, potentially killer apps for the ERNIE ecosystem. By doing so, we should be able to generate new growth opportunities. For example, after rebuilding with GenAI and LLMs, Baidu Wenku, our one-stop shop for document creation, experienced double-digit year-over-year increase in paying users in the first quarter. Penetration of ERNIE for Baidu search and feed took longer than expected because the user base is in the order of hundreds of millions, and use cases are generally very sensitive to cost and response time. We need a wide range of ERNIE models in different sizes, optimized for different scenarios for best price performance ratio. After trial and error for a few quarters, we are firming up our strategy. Going forward, we plan to accelerate the launch and adoption of new product features such as multimodal generative search results, multi-round interaction in search, and more recently, distribution of ERNIE agents. We are at the forefront globally of this unique technological change, and we are confident in our abilities to innovate. By definition, we are operating in uncharted territory. As always, we want to be flexible to make timely adjustments with evolving consumer needs and how users incorporate new product features in their day-to-day life. Now, let me review the key highlights for each business for the first quarter. In the first quarter, AI cloud revenue reached RMB 4.7 billion, up 12% year over year, and continued to generate operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. The revenue growth was mainly driven by GenAI and foundation models. In the first quarter, such revenue accounted for 6.9% of total AI cloud revenue. Currently, the majority of this revenue is from model training, but revenue from model inferencing has been growing quickly. We believe revenue from GenAI and foundation models will continue to rise as customer adoption improves. For instance, within our internal cloud revenue Baidu Core, other business groups, such as mobile ecosystem groups and intelligent driving group are increasingly leveraging the power of ERNIE. As a result, 15% of their payments to the AI cloud group are allocated to GenAI and foundation model. Enterprises choose Baidu AI cloud to train and host their models because they believe we have the most powerful and efficient AI infrastructure for model training and inferencing in China. Compared to our peers, we help enterprises to train model at all sizes on our AI cloud while also reducing model inferencing cost. This is primarily attributable to two reasons. Number one, our self-developed four-layer AI architecture has allowed us to innovate and optimize at each layer, enabling continuous efficiency gain. And number two, we have superior capabilities and insights in GPU cluster management. Leveraging our technical expertise, we can now integrate GPUs from various vendors into a unified computing cluster to train an LLM. Our platform has demonstrated very high efficiency with this setup on a GPU cluster that is composed of hundreds, even thousands of GPUs. This is an important breakthrough because of the limited availability of imported GPUs. Another growth driver for AI cloud is cross-selling of our CPU cloud services to our GPU cloud customers. With the high recognition of our GPU cloud among existing and new customers, we have seen customers increasingly switch more and more of their CPU cloud usage to Baidu. As I mentioned earlier on the MaaS side, we took many initiatives to make the ERNIE family of models increasingly affordable and efficient than open-sourced models. Here are some highlights for this quarter. We have expanded and enhanced our ERNIE model portfolio, offering a total of three lightweight LLMs and two test-specific LLMs, ModelBuilder. This model helps enterprises and professional developers balance model performance with cost in ERNIE to reach a broader audience for model development. In addition, our mixture of experts, or MOE approach, can position a user query into distinct tasks, assigning the most suitable models to handle each task and use ERNIE 3.5 or 4.0 only for the most complex tasks. This approach allows for faster responses and lower inferencing cost, while maintaining similar performance level to using more advanced models. Last quarter, we introduced AppBuilder to developers. Throughout the quarter, we continued in reaching and refining the tools for AppBuilder, enabling developers to easily create AI-native apps in just three steps on our platform. With the launch of AgentBuilder in April, anyone can create an AI agent with just a few sentences on Baidu. Overall, we remain confident in the strong for our AI cloud revenue, and we aim to continue generating operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. Mobile ecosystem has continued to deliver healthy margins and strong free cash flow. In the first quarter, our online marketing revenue grew by 3% year over year. Revenue growth was impacted by a challenging macro environment. At the same time, we have been pushing hard to transform the user experience from a traditional mobile product to a generative AI experience. This transition is ongoing and monetization has not yet started. We also continued to leverage ERNIE to reconstruct our monetization system for better conversion and efficiency gain. During the quarter, we further enhanced our ad-targeting capabilities and scaled up real-time ad generation. These efforts resulted in an improvement in conversion and generated incremental revenue. ERNIE agents stand for a long-term opportunity for monetization upgrade, too. Recently, we have seen, not only brand advertisers, but also SMEs gradually adopting ERNIE agents. We have designed this agents for SMEs as virtual storefront and service desk, serving consumers around the clock. We believe that the use of agents can improve SME's sell-through rate, enhance their productivity, and expand their reach among users. This will be an important step for us to transform our traditional CPC model to a significantly more efficient CPS model and, meanwhile, enhancing user experience on Baidu. Going forward, I believe greater opportunities will arise from AI-native apps, particularly for GenAI-enabled Baidu Search. GenAI complements traditional search, expanding the total addressable market. Since Q2 last year, we have been reconstructing Baidu Search with ERNIE. Now, more and more search results are generated by ERNIE in a growing variety of formats like text, image, third-party links, point of interest, and citation. These results are usually produced in real time to directly address users' questions and problems. By doing so, we have improved and will continue to enhance the search experience which is crucial for increasing the usage of Baidu Search. While user feedback on this product and feature renovations has been encouraging, it is important to note that we are still in the early stages of reconstructing Baidu Search with ERNIE. This process will likely take time given that Baidu Search has a history spanning over 20 years, and user behavior will evolve gradually. Overall, I believe that search will be one most likely killer app in the GenAI era, and we are on the right trajectory to capitalize on this potential. I mentioned ERNIE agents as an important opportunity for monetization. With newly introduced AgentBuilder, creators, publishers, and service providers will find it increasingly easy to build agents on Baidu. This initiative is key to enhancing Baidu's content offerings and ultimately provide an AI-native user experience on our platform. Moving on to intelligent driving. We believe Apollo Go stands as the largest autonomous ride-hailing service provider globally, measured by the ride provided to the public. In the first quarter, Apollo Go offered about 826,000 rides to the public, marking a 25% year-over-year increase. In April, the total number of rides surpassed 6 million. We are continuing to move forward -- move toward achieving unit economics breakeven for Apollo Go. To make this happen, our strategy is to reach UE breakeven in key regions and then replicate the success in other regions. To reach the regional breakeven point, we are focusing on scaling up the operations of fully driverless ride-hailing service and enhance the utilization of each vehicle. Wuhan, Apollo Go's largest regional operations, is progressing toward this goal. In Wuhan, Apollo Go is gradually becoming an integral part of the city's transportation network. Apollo Go more than doubled its operational area from a quarter ago, serving a population of over 7 million and achieving the remarkable milestone of crossing Yangtze River with fully driverless vehicles as part of its expansion. Moreover, our vehicles started to operate 24/7 in Wuhan in early March, further expanding Apollo Go's reach and improving the vehicle utilization. All these progresses have led to the rapid growth of fully driverless rides. In Q1, the rides provided by fully driverless vehicles accounted for over 55% of total rides in Wuhan, which is up from 45% in the fourth quarter last year. This figure continues to rise, exceeding 70% in April, with expectations of sustained rapid growth ahead and reaching 100% in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy RT6, our sixth generation Robotaxi in our Wuhan Apollo Go operation this year which will significantly reduce hardware depreciation costs. With the scaling of driverless operations and continuous improvement of cost structure, we believe Apollo Go will achieve operational UE breakeven in Wuhan in the near future. As Apollo Go continues to progress, we will closely monitor efficiency and persist in optimizing the operation of our overall intelligent driving business. On auto solutions, our Apollo self-driving for ASD technology continue to evolve. I mentioned in our last earnings call that Apollo is a global pioneer in the use of visual foundation models in autonomous driving. Now, our state-of-the-art autonomous driving solution, solely reliant on vision, is made available to OEMs. ASD can effectively navigate complex, urban environments across over 100 cities in China with plans to expand in to hundreds of cities in the coming months. This allows us to make advanced autonomous driving attainable across a broad spectrum of passenger vehicles from high-end to economy models priced as low as 150,000 RMB, and it serves as another proof of our technology leadership. With that, let me turn the call over to Rong to go through the financial results.Rong Luo -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Robin. Now, let me walk through the details of our first-quarter financial results. Total revenues were RMB 31.5 billion, increasing 1% year over year. Revenue from Baidu Core was RMB 23.8 billion, increasing 4% year over year. Baidu Core's online marketing revenue was RMB 17 billion, 1-7, increasing 3% year over year. Baidu Core's non-online marketing revenue was RMB 6.8 billion, up 6% year over year, mainly driven by the AI cloud business. Revenue for iQIYI was RMB 7.9 billion, decreasing 5% year over year. Cost of revenue was RMB 15.3 billion, increasing 1% year over year, primarily due to an increase in traffic acquisition costs and costs related to AI cloud business partially offset by the decrease in content costs. Operating expenses were RMB 10.7 billion, decreasing 2% year over year, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses and other R&D expenditures, partially offset by the increase in server depreciation expenses and server custody fees, which support GenAI research and development inputs. Baidu Core's operating expenses were RMB 9.4 billion, decreasing 1% year over year. Baidu Core SG&A expenses were RMB 4.5 billion, decreasing 1% year over year.

And free cash flow excluding iQIYI was RMB 3.3 billion. Finally, Baidu Core had approximately 36,000 employees as of March 31st, 2024. With that, operator, let's now open the call to questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Alicia Yap with Citigroup.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you. Good evening Robin, Rong, and also -- sorry. So, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask, were you able to quantify how has AI technology been helping Baidu to improve app monetization rate? Can management share some feedback on those advertisers who have adopted this system? In what kind of areas do they see the largest improvements, and are there any areas that can be further enhanced? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Alicia. This is Robin. As you know, our monetization system was the first to benefit from GenAI, generating several hundred million RMB per quarter in incremental revenue. Since the second half of last year, we have been utilizing ERNIE to upgrade our monetization system, enhancing various aspects of ad technology. This includes -- including adding capabilities, refining the options system, automating creative generation, and add strategy formation for our advertisers. Advertisers have been seeing better conversion and more sales leads. This improvement has motivated advertisers to increase their spending with Baidu. So, in the first quarter, AI-related incremental advertising revenue grew on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we expect this trend to continue. The incremental revenue has helped us mitigate the broader macro weakness and also bought us some time to reconstruct our user product with ERNIE. As I emphasized in my opening remarks, we believe ERNIE agent offers a significant long-term opportunity for our online marketing business. Agents function as virtual stores or domains. Advertisers can establish their online presence and interact with potential customers using natural language through multi-round conversations. With the introduction of AgentBuilder, advertisers can easily create customized ERNIE agents. When advertisers express their intentions to these agents, they can more effectively achieve their goals, whether it's helping potential customers understand their products or improving customer service quality. Agents can also help enrich our content offering and improve user experience on Baidu. While still in early stage, ERNIE agents have helped some advertisers achieve better ROIs. For example, we have a customer in online education. They used AgentBuilder to create its AI agent, injecting it with key insights like product introduction and subject matter expertise, while continually providing feedback for refinement. This agent has significantly enhanced the company's online customer service by offering round the clock high-quality consultations. The adoption of ERNIE agent led to a 20% increase in ad conversion rate for this online education company. I think this is just the beginning. We believe agent will be a major form of content and services in the new AI era. We will continue to improve the capabilities of ERNIE Agent. Agents will not only elevate user experience, both conversion and ROI for advertisers, but also, over time, foster increase in transactions directly generated on our platform. This shift should help us to transform our tradition CPC model into a more efficient CPS model. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Gary Yu with Morgan Stanley.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Thank you, management, for the opportunity to ask questions. I have a question regarding AI cloud business. How has the price cut initiative by some of your peer companies affected Baidu AI cloud business, and how should we think about the cloud revenue profitability as competition heats up, and also how should we -- what should be the sustainable level of cloud growth outlook going forward? Thank you.Dou Shen -- Executive Vice President, AI Cloud Group ACG Yeah, Gary. This is Dou. As we have already mentioned, GenAI and foundation models are transforming the cloud industry from general purpose computing to AI computing. So, this shift is reshaping the competitive landscape within the cloud industry, presenting us with the valuable opportunity to establish ourselves as a leader in AI cloud. We believe we offer China's most efficient AI infrastructure and most advanced MaaS platform for model training and inference. As a result, more and more enterprises are choosing us for model training, fine-tuning, and AI-native app development on our public cloud. This increasing demand has significantly boosted our AI cloud revenue. Actually, since the second quarter, the second half of last year, our AI cloud revenue growth has started to accelerate from a year-over-year decline in the third quarter to an 11% increase in the fourth quarter last year, and then further accelerated to 12% in the first quarter this year. The revenue acceleration was supported by two main factors: the incremental revenue directly generated by GenAI and foundation models, and also the new opportunities they provide to our legacy cloud business. As Robin just mentioned, in the first quarter of this year, revenue from GenAI and foundation models accounts for 6.9 of our AI cloud revenue. And then our traditional CPU cloud businesses were capitalizing on the opportunities presented by GenAI and foundation models. Both factors were important growth drivers of our AI cloud. On a separate note, while the smart transportation business remained subdued, its impact on overall AI cloud business in Q1 was substantially smaller than the previous quarters. So, overall, we expect our AI cloud to continue benefiting from the trend to maintain strong revenue growth momentum in the upcoming quarters. On the profit side, Baidu AI cloud continued to generate non-GAAP operating profit as we have seen in previous quarters. We are committed to sustainable and healthy revenue growth. During the quarter, we maintained our focus on achieving high-quality revenue growth by scaling down low-margin business. Regarding the business of GenAI and foundation models, the market is still at a very early stage, so our focus remains on educating the market and broadening our footprint across more enterprises. Looking to the long run, we expect the normalized margin for GenAI and foundational models related business to improve further and to be higher than our traditional cloud business. Regarding the change of pricing policies of some competitors that you just mentioned, it is actually pretty common for cloud vendors to adjust their pricing for certain products. This is a trend we have observed multiple times in the past. Given that our cloud offering has expanded beyond traditional CPU cloud to a high-value AI product and services, the industry changes on CPU cloud pricing has a minimum impact of the development of our AI cloud. Actually for cloud platform services, by leveraging our unique proprietary four-layer AI architecture and our strong ability in end-to-end automation, we have lowered ERNIE's inference cost to only 1% over the variant in March last year. This May, ERNIE handles about 200 million API calls or approximately 250 billion tokens daily. We are confident that ERNIE's expanding adoption will continue to enhance its performance, boosting efficiency, and then further reduce costs. It's also important to evaluate price and performance ratio for different models at different workloads, rather than just focusing solely on some superficial prices. We believe our state-of-the-art AI infrastructure and advanced MaaS platform delivers the best value to our customers. Looking forward, leveraging our strong AI capabilities, we aim to continuously attract new customers and encourage existing ones to increase their spending on Baidu AI cloud. At the same time, we aim to consistently generate positive non-GAAP operating profit. Thank you, Gary.OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Yao with JPMorgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi, good evening, management, and thank you for taking our question. Given the chip shortage in China, how does Baidu maintain its commitment to deliver differentiated value while enhancing its leading advantage in LLM technology in China? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Alex. We do think very differently in this aspect. We are taking an application-driven approach for our AI push. For example, solving all the high school math problems using the most advanced LLM may not be the highest priority at this time, while generating convincing reasons for users to buy the right products is more important in a lot of applications. With that in mind, we are taking advantage of our unique four-layer AI tech stack to optimize the cost and performance of ERNIE models, and we make sure customers and developers can easily build applications using tools like AgentBuilder, AppBuilder, and ModelBuilder. For the AI infrastructure layer, a key factor contributing to our high efficiency in model training and inference is our superior capability in GPU cluster management. We have recently made a breakthrough by integrating GPUs from different vendors into one large scale, unified computing cluster, allowing us to use less-advanced chips for highly effective model training and inference. Our deep learning framework, PaddlePaddle, has been through continuous innovation and enhancement, helped reduce the cost of model training and inferencing on a constant basis. PaddlePaddle is compatible with over 50 different chips, many domestically designed, and the developer community has grown to 13 million. With ERNIE 3.5 and ERNIE 4.0 remain to be the flagship models for sophisticated tasks, we're making ERNIE more accessible and affordable by launching lightweight LLMs, introducing a toolkits for model development and app development, applying MOE approach for model inference for better performance and lower cost. With our application-driven mindset, we have used ERNIE extensively to renovate our own products, and we have gained experience and insights in training and using ERNIE, as well as developing AI-native applications on it. We're making all these capabilities available to our customers and developers. With all these efforts, we are fostering a vibrant and healthy ecosystem around ERNIE. We can see that we are actually taking a holistic approach to developing GenAI and LLM, which is very different from some of our competitors. Our reserve and access to the chips on the market should be sufficient for us to support millions of AI applications in the future. And in the long run, I think China will form an ecosystem of its own, probably with less powerful chips but most efficient homegrown software stack. There is ample room for innovation in the application layer, model layer, and framework layer. With ourselves developing a four-layer AI infrastructure, as well as our strong R&D team, our dedication to AI and our application-driven approach in building an ecosystem around ERNIE, I'm quite confident that Baidu will stand as a leader in China's AI ecosystem in the long term. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Lincoln Kong with Goldman Sachs.Lincoln Kong -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you, management, for taking my question. My question is about the advertising business. So, what's the major drag for the advertising growth if we compare it with our peers? So, what are the trends we have seen for advertising budgets and advertiser sentiment, especially into second quarter April and May? How should we think about normalized advertising growth for 2024? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, our online marketing revenue grew by 3% year over year in the first quarter. While traditional search is maturing, we are working hard to renovate the user experience with GenAI. Right now, about 11% of our search result pages are filled with generated results. These results provide more accurate, better organized, and direct answers to users' questions and, in some cases, enable users to do things they could not do before. We have not started the monetization of those GenAI results, so it will take some time for revenue to catch up. And the weak macro also contributed to the softness of our ad business. Our advertisers come from a wide range of industries with the majority being SMEs. This makes our advertising revenue highly sensitive to the macro environment, particularly to the offline economy. In the first quarter, advertiser sentiment in some verticals, such as real estate and franchising, remained weak. Specifically in the real estate industry, not only was ad spending from developers and agencies muted, but the impact also extended to both upstream and downstream sectors. For example, energy, chemicals, machinery, building materials for upstream and home renovation, furniture, which is kind of downstream, all saw constrained ad spending on our platform. Also, many SMEs in offline sectors need more time to recover as they have been hit hard in the past few years. As we enter the second quarter, we have not seen improvement in advertiser sentiment. Given the limited visibility for sentiment improvement and paired with tough comps in Q2, our online marketing revenue should remain fundamentally solid, but from a growth perspective, soft over the next few quarters. Beyond the near-term challenges, we expect online marketing to remain a bread-and-butter business for Baidu for the foreseeable future. Search is one of the most popular apps in the internet age, and Baidu remains the largest search engine in China with close to 700 million MAUs. Search will likely be one of the killer apps in the age of GenAI. Technology innovation will enable us to better engage users with developers and merchants, directly connect users' intentions with the most relevant product and service offering in more natural ways. Yeah. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, good evening. Thanks management for taking my questions. My question is about how much more room do we see in cost cutting? Previously, you mentioned there will be a lag between the investment and AI revenue contribution. How should we look at margin trends in 2024 if you intend to expand your AI offering? Thank you.Rong Luo -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Thomas. Thanks so much for your question. I think our macro challenges are still weighing on our marketing businesses, but we are confident that there still will be some ways for us to continue optimizing the operational efficiency. We will stringently manage our cost expenses for each businesses, and we will take some further steps as necessary, including we'll try to streamline the organization structures to enhance the agility and support strategy flexibility. And we also will reallocate resources to prioritize the key structure areas. If I take a look into our businesses, for mobile ecosystem, I think we can still manage the costs and expenses. So, mobile ecosystem group continues to remain strongly profitable and cash-flow positive. For AI cloud, as Dou just mentioned, we will continue to phase out low-margin businesses and products, so we can continue generating the operating profits and margins on a non-GAAP basis. If we're looking to longer term, the normalized margin for the GenAI related cloud businesses should be higher than the legacy cloud businesses. For other businesses, we aim to reduce our loss, as we talked about in the past few quarters, particularly our intelligent driving business with more operational efficiency gains and UI improvements for Robotaxi. Many investors ask me how our investments in ERNIE will impact net margins. In fact, our reinvestments are mainly related to capex for model training and inference. In 2023, we made a large purchase which has arrived at different times and the different depreciation start dates. While the annualized depreciation expenses will be available in the whole year 2024, the impact on our overall cost expenses and quarterly earnings is quite predictable and manageable. The depreciation expenses book under R&D expenses for computing power use and training, and the cost of revenue for computing power reduced for model inference and business expenses. In the first quarter, we can see that Baidu Core's non-GAAP R&D and the cost of revenue both increased very slightly, while non-GAAP operating margin actually we have expanded to 23.5% due to disciplined spending on other items such as SG&A. We believe that the chips we have in hand are sufficient to support training of ERNIE for the next one or two years. And because of the limited availability of high-performance chips in China in this year, 2024, we expect our capex to be smaller versus last year. In conclusion, the investments in GenAI and large language models will have a manageable impact on the near-term margins, and with our monetization of earnings already taking off, we expect that more and more revenue and profit will be generated from that kind of business, for both mobile ecosystem and AI cloud. Overall, we believe that high-quality growth and investment should be very balanced. For many years now, we have delivered a solid track record of top-line growth with very resolute cost discipline, and we intend to continue building our future on this kind of business. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from [Inaudible] with UBS.Unknown speaker Good evening. Thanks, management, for taking our question. My question is about shareholder return. So, how about should we think about the execution pace of the current 5 billion buyback program in addition to your current buyback program? Should we expect other diversified approach to improve shareholder return? Thank you.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks so much for your questions. I think we highly value our shareholders, and we have been making efforts to increase the shareholder returns. We have consistently repurchased our shares from the market over the past four years, averaging around $1 billion annually. In total, we have allocated around 37% of our free cash flow toward the share buyback progress. I think during these period and going forward, we will continue to buy back more shares from the market as we believe in our long-term growth opportunities, and we are very committed to the shareholder returns. And in addition, we have utilized our current share repurchase program to prevent any significant increase in the total outstanding share count, aiming to reduce the potential dilution of our shareholders' economic stake in Baidu. In the year 2023, you can see that our total number of shares outstanding was flat year over year compared to a 1.2% increase in the year 2022 and a 3.2% increase in the year 2021. In this quarter, the total shares outstanding began to decrease. We can see that it has been declining by 0.5% as compared to the prior quarters. We are adopting a strategy of sustainable and recurring share buyback programs for the open market and, at the same time, we are taking into consideration the opportunities ahead of us. Now, we are facing a huge opportunity in GenAI and foundation models, and we have structured a concrete plan to capitalize it. So, we want to have the flexibility to invest as we consider necessary and in the best interests of long-term value to the shareholders. Furthermore, we believe that the most effective way to create value for shareholders is by building strong base fundamentals. Our core marketing business remains steady, and we believe that AI will help us to build another growth engine over time. Thank you so much for your question.OperatorYour next question comes from Miranda Zhuang with BofA Securities.Miranda Zhuang -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. My question is about Robotaxi. So, can management share more updates on the Robotaxi initiatives and the geographic coverage for this year? I think previously you'd mentioned that Apollo Go will achieve operating UE breakeven in Wuhan in the near future. I want to understand what's the logic behind the efforts to continue to improve the UE. What's the projected size of the vehicle fleet for this year, and how will it potentially impact the cost? Thanks.Robin Li -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Miranda. Let me give you some more color on the Robotaxi business. In 2023, Apollo Go made significant progress in improving the regional unit economics in key cities. Let me use Wuhan, Apollo Go's largest operation, to explain how we achieved that. We kicked-off Apollo Go's commercial operations in Wuhan back in 2022. Since then, we've witnessed a consistent enhancement in operational UE, which can be attributed to the expanding scale of driverless operations and decreasing cost per vehicle. Regarding scale expansion, our vehicle fleet has been steadily growing. Compared to one year ago, our fully driverless fleet in Wuhan has grown threefold, reaching about 300 vehicles today. Meanwhile, both the operational area and service hours for our fully driverless operations have been consistently expanding, thanks to the increasing recognition of our autonomous driving technology by the local government. The operational coverage area for our fully driverless ride-hailing service increased by eightfold from a year ago, now covering over 7 million people in Wuhan. Apollo Go's operational hours also gradually expanded from only the off-peak hours in the beginning to adding peak hours to its operations and eventually extending to 24/7 in March of this year. The scale expansion resulted in a consistent improvement of UE in terms of revenue. Both daily rides per vehicle and distance per ride have been growing. When it comes to cost, the majority is labor cost and hardware expenditures. We have been demonstrating consistent track record of safe operations, which helps us to increase deployment of fully driverless ride-hailing operations. In April, the proportion of fully driverless orders rose to 70%. That's up from only 10% in August 2022 and 45% Q4 of last year. We expect this figure to reach 100% in the coming quarters, thereby enabling us to minimize the cost related to safety officers. In addition to lowering the labor cost, we are steadfast in driving down hardware costs. The mass production and timeline of RT6, our sixth-generation Robotaxi, remains on track. Adopting a battery swapping solution, the mass production price for RT6 excluding battery is below $30,000. We will use RT6 as the primary vehicle in the future fleet expansion, and it should help to significantly reduce the hardware depreciation cost for each vehicle, and further improving our UE and bringing us closer to profitability. Looking to this quarter, we plan to expand the fully driverless fleet of our Wuhan operation to 1,000 vehicles by the end of the year, more than tripling from the end of last year. Our focus remains on improving regional UE and narrowing the losses for Apollo Go business. With continued improvement in operational efficiency and cost reduction, we believe Apollo Go will achieve operational UE breakeven in Wuhan first. And once that's achieved, we can scale up the operation quickly. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

      "Walmart (WMT 1.00%)Q1 2025 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to Walmart's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, senior vice president, investor relations. Steph, you may now begin.Steph Wissink -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our home office in Bentonville are Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug and John David will first share their views on the quarter, and then we'll open the line to your questions. During the Q&A portion, we will be joined by our segment CEOs: John Furner from Walmart U.S., Kath McLay from Walmart International, and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. For additional details on our results, including highlights by segment, please see our earnings release and accompanying presentation on our website. We will make every effort to answer as many questions as we can in the hour we have scheduled for this call. As a courtesy, please limit yourself to one question.Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that wraps my intro. We're ready to begin. Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered a great quarter to start the year. Our results were stronger than we anticipated, with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit up 12.9% in constant currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the business is driven by growth in units sold and transaction counts, as well as market share gains, including general merchandise. These are not inflation-driven results. In the U.S., like-for-like sales inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter, including mid-single-digit deflation in general merchandise and low single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers, we're making progress lowering prices. Our rollback count is up, and customers are responding to our price leadership. The first highlight I'd like to call out is the improvement in customer experience scores. That has a lot to do with our associates. I get to visit with a lot of them as I travel. This quarter, I've been in stores and clubs in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Toronto, Nashville, Los Angeles, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Dallas. And before we get too far into the conversation about our performance, I want to thank all our associates everywhere. They deserve all the credit. They're managing the things we've always managed while simultaneously building new capabilities and driving change. Here's what they're doing to drive our business. First, we're providing value. Low prices on quality merchandise are always important to our customers and members. Our combination of everyday low prices, plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating. During the holiday, we offered a basket of Easter items with a lower price than a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Customers responded, and we saw strong sell-throughs. Our merchants are doing a great job, including managing inventory, where we finished down 2.7% globally. Second, we have the selection people are looking for. In the U.S., the number of marketplace sellers grew about 36% for the quarter, with the SKU count now sitting at more than 420 million. In Mexico, the number of marketplace sellers grew by more than 50%, with SKU count up nearly 80%. More often, our customers are finding what they're looking for when they shop on our app or site. The e-commerce penetration is up in all our markets. Third, we're improving the experience of shopping with us. Our store remodels look good and are performing well. Plus, our curbside pickup and delivery capabilities are improving, as indicated by our customer experience metrics. Globally, we completed nearly 70 remodels during the quarter, and we're on track to do more than 900 this year. We're making it more convenient to shop with us, and our customers and members are rewarding us with growth as we save them time. We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this year while managing our price gaps and investing in our associates at the same time. This quarter's results were driven by a combination of strong core performance and the growth of our newer businesses. As it relates to the core, strong same-store sales growth, combined with good inventory management, resulted in strong profit flow-through. In our newer businesses, advertising and membership were both up 24%. Today, we announced that we're expanding our data analytics and insights product, Walmart Luminate, into Mexico and Canada. Our technology team continues to deliver the innovation that helps us drive our business. We're bringing new experiences to life like generative AI-driven product search that helps our customers shop more intuitively. The team continues to build and improve the platforms for marketplace and data that we're using across countries, and they're building and improving the operating system that enables us to create a more intelligent, flexible, and automated supply chain. The implementation of our automated storage and retrieval systems in our DCs and FCs is on track, and we're as enthusiastic about the impact of that work as we've ever been. Turning to our segments. In Walmart U.S., we recently announced a new private brand in food called bettergoods. It's our largest food private brand release in 20 years. The brand focuses on today's trends and premium quality. But at the same time, 70% of bettergoods items are priced under $5. This is the type of quality and value that will resonate with customers across income spectrums. We also introduced on-demand early morning delivery to customer doorsteps as early as 7 a.m. and as quickly as 30 minutes. Globally, same-day delivery is available from more than 6,500 locations. In Walmart U.S., over the last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered same or next day, with about 20% of those delivered in under three hours. Delivery times are getting faster, and the cost to delivery is coming down at the same time. During the quarter, we made the necessary but difficult decision to close our U.S. healthcare clinics. There were a number of aspects that were going well, and we really want to be part of the solution to improving healthcare in this country. But the reality is that given reimbursement rates and costs to serve, we could no longer see a path to achieving an acceptable level of profitability, and we're committed to being disciplined with our investments. We're grateful to our associates that worked in this area. They did their part. We'll continue to build our pharmacy and optical businesses, and we'll find ways for our pharmacists to help, as they've done with immunizations and vaccinations. Earlier this week, we also shared decisions to eliminate some home office roles and reduce the amount of remote work. The vast majority of our home office associates have been back together in offices since we came back from the pandemic, and we want to see even more of that. Being in person is important. Our culture is stronger when we're together. We make decisions faster, we're more creative, and we help develop the next generation of talent. We'll continue to make changes to ensure we're best positioned to serve customers and support our store, club, and supply chain associates. Moving to Walmart International. We continue to deliver strong results, with double-digit growth in sales and profit, lifting our company growth rates. Strength was broad-based, led by Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Results for the quarter included strong growth in e-commerce, led by store fulfilled orders and marketplace. We saw improved sales growth in general merchandise categories as we focused on celebrations across the world like Chinese New Year, Easter, and Walmart Canada's 30th anniversary. Like the U.S., the international team is improving speed of delivery across markets. Same-day delivery orders in India grew by over 150% in the quarter and is now available across 20 major cities. One-hour delivery in China grew to 55 million orders as customers sought convenience during Chinese New Year. And in Chile, 60% of e-commerce orders are delivered same day. With Sam's Club U.S., it's exciting to see how the team is using computer vision to make it faster for members using Scan & Go to leave the building once they're done shopping. I'm referring to the computer vision and AI-powered exit technology that allows members to leave the club without having to stand in line to get the receipt check that we announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Since then, we've deployed it in about 20% of our clubs, and we're on track to have it in all U.S. clubs by year-end. In addition to this being better for members, the technology identifies more items than we could with our previous process. This is a great example of people-led, tech-powered, solving for technology that benefits the member experience. It was a strong start to the year. We'll remain focused on improving customer and member experiences, being great merchants, building our newer businesses, and improving returns. With that, I'll hand it to John David to share more about the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Doug. Our strong results this quarter clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver on our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. This quarter's results reflect strong execution from the team across virtually every aspect of our business, share gains and improving NPS scores from our members and customers that are increasingly looking for value and convenience, and the power of our omni retail model. I'll discuss our quarterly results using our framework of growth, margins, and returns. We experienced ongoing sales strength, with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations. We're growing traffic and units, and our inventories are in excellent shape. We're on a multiyear journey to reshape our profit profile, and operating income growth trajectory in this quarter reflects the benefits of improved margins in our core retail operations, as well as contributions from business mix. We're investing in areas that have strong capital returns like automation, store remodels, and digital tools and technologies. Combined, these investments are widening our competitive advantages, providing us levers to also invest in people and price while achieving our sales and margin objectives. Before I provide more color behind the strength of our financial results, I want to remind you that there is a supplemental presentation on our IR website, with additional information beyond my remarks. First quarter, total net sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis, ahead of our guidance of 4% to 5% growth. As a reminder, the leap year this year contributes approximately 1 point to our year-over-year sales growth. International led the enterprise with constant currency sales growth of 10.7%, reflecting strength in Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Across markets, seasonal events were strong, and we're encouraged by early improvements in general merchandise sales. International e-commerce sales were up 19% as we continue to expand our capabilities. In Canada, the majority of our marketplace growth came from items serviced by Walmart Fulfillment Services. And in India, Flipkart's same-day delivery became available to millions more customers as they expanded the offering to 20 cities. Walmart U.S. also delivered better-than-expected growth, with comp sales up 3.8%, including strong e-commerce growth of 22%, led by store-fulfilled, pickup and delivery, marketplace, and advertising. Traffic and sales growth were strong across both stores and digital channels, and we're pleased with the unit growth. We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts, with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of the share gains. Sam's U.S. comp sales, ex fuel, were also strong at 4.4%. The Sam's team continues to make progress on quality and value with Member's Mark, our private brand. The team is doing a great job of being on top of product trends with the brand. Member's Mark drove high single-digit growth in Q1 and is a growing reason why members join and renew, alongside digitally enabled solutions such as Scan & Go and curbside pickup. Next to sales, gross profit growth was the key driver of upside in Q1. Consolidated gross margin expanded 42 basis points, led by Walmart U.S. Across segments, we benefited from lower markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management and favorable business mix, enabling strong margin flow-through from sales. Consolidated adjusted operating income grew 12.9% in constant currency, more than 700 basis points higher than our sales growth. This reflects better-than-expected sales growth and higher gross margins and membership income. This was partially offset by expense deleverage in our U.S. segments related to higher variable pay expenses from our outperformance. Walmart U.S. was the primary driver of outperformance, but all segments contributed to operating income growing faster than sales. Taking a closer look at margins. As we continue to work closely with our suppliers to lower cost, we're managing our Walmart U.S. pricing, aligned to competitive price gaps, and customers are responding favorably, resulting in sustained sales growth and higher gross margins. Our price gaps to the retail market remained strong. Improved inventory management and favorable business mix allowed us to optimize our pricing on everyday essentials, and we're investing further in value within our private brands. Our rollback program is driving customer engagement and supporting our volume growth, with grocery rollback counts up 45% year over year in April. Carrying forward the success we saw last year in our seasonal programs, we're using celebrations and festive events to reinforce our value proposition, and customers are responding. Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, and Easter drove stronger sales across categories, including general merchandise. We're also working with suppliers to bring innovation to U.S. customers while leaning into our own private brands as sources of value, quality, and newness. As a result, we've continued to see strong momentum in private brand sales, with grocery penetration up 30 basis points in Q1. While private brand penetration is in the low 20s as a percent of sales, more than half of all customer grocery baskets over the last year have had a private brand in them. Our inventory levels continue to come down, with Walmart U.S. declining about 4% and Sam's down nearly 5% at quarter-end, while we sustain strong sales and healthy in-stock rates. Having the right inventory in the right categories and the right places has allowed us to not only minimize markdown activity but also support higher in-stock levels, with goods flowing more smoothly through distribution centers and to stores. Importantly, the business is realizing efficiencies while both customer and associate NPS scores are rising. Global e-commerce growth was 21% in Q1, and e-commerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in the U.S. net delivery cost per order, improving nearly 40%. More customers are shopping with us more often across more categories, moving us along the pathway of delivery density and transaction margins that give us clear visibility into profitability in this channel over time. Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix as they're spending more of their paychecks on nondiscretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it's consistent with our expectations. Our Walmart U.S. team is executing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility of our growing e-commerce brand assortments in fashion, home, and electronics. We have the opportunity to grow general merchandise sales in stores with our first-party e-commerce assortment and especially with our marketplace. We were encouraged to see share gains in fashion, home, and hard lines in Q1. In addition, marketplace sales in categories such as furniture, sporting goods, kids apparel, and home grew more than 20%. In addition to sales growth and gross margin improvement, the reshaping of our profit composition is an exciting part of our strategy. We're enhancing capabilities in higher-margin growth drivers such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights and seeing the corresponding improvement in our business mix. Global advertising grew 24%, led by 26% growth from Walmart Connect in the U.S. and international's 27% growth. Walmart's U.S. ad sales reflected more than 50% growth from marketplace sellers, while overall active advertiser counts increased nearly 19%. Sam's ad business now has 30% more active advertisers versus last year. We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club U.S. reached another record high level for member counts and Plus member penetration, resulting in membership income growth over 13%. Sam's China member count grew 25%, with increasing active and renewal rates. In addition, Walmart+ continued to grow double digits as members engage with us more frequently and spend more than other customers. For marketplace, within international, all markets grew double digits, led by Flipkart and Walmex, reflecting the strength we're experiencing across markets. In the U.S., Walmart's marketplace delivered strong results, aided by 36% more sellers on our platform, with 28% of sellers using our marketplace fulfillment services. To give you an example of the benefit of our omni model, in April, we launched a new service enabling customers to order from an extended assortment of nearly 40,000 tires on our marketplace and have them installed at one of our 2,300 auto care centers and stores in the U.S. It's a great example of how we're leveraging our unique omni capabilities to remove friction for customers. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to see strong demand from clients for their insights on consumer behavior and trends and our omnichannel operations. In Q1, this business doubled versus last year. In April, we announced a new self-serve integration to make it easier for supplier advertisers to combine Walmart Luminate's insights with Walmart Connect's closed-loop omnichannel retail media solutions to help drive product, brand, and category sales. This is the first time we're bringing these two solutions together, creating greater cohesion between both offerings and helping suppliers deliver more relevant shopping experiences for our customers. Beyond executing on our operating strategies, you're also seeing a discipline from us to address areas of our business that have not performed as well. You should expect this discipline to continue, concentrating our efforts and capital on clear drivers of incremental value. This requires us to be bold enough to step back from areas that, at one time, were clear opportunities or were strategically or financially accretive, but now have diminishing value. It was through this lens that we made the decision to close all 51 Walmart Health Centers, as Doug mentioned. Total business reorganization cost resulted in a charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Wrapping up Q1 results. Below-the-line items reflected slightly higher interest expense on relatively flat net debt balances and a lower tax rate year over year, based on changes in the fair value of our equity investments. Adjusted EPS of $0.60 per share compared favorably to our guidance of $0.49 to $0.52. Turning to guidance. Our team is executing at a very high level. Q1 results exceeded our expectations for both sales and operating income growth. And while it might be a little much to expect every quarter to be this good, we feel really good about the performance, and it demonstrates how this business can perform when we're firing on all cylinders. Consumer economic conditions have been relatively consistent since the start of the year. Many of the value-seeking behaviors we witnessed last year have continued, particularly around seasonal events. Our focus on providing customers with value and convenience is resonating, and we're gaining share. That said, we're one quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We currently expect Q2 sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% and for operating income growth in line with that at roughly 3% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.62 and $0.65 per share. In Q2, we expect operating income growth to be impacted by timing of tech and wage investments. Combining Q1 results with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance would suggest first half sales would grow nearly 5% and operating income would grow about 8%. We feel really good about our start to the year, and our outlook for the second half is consistent with 90 days ago. Our Q1 results and the midpoint of our 2Q guidance suggest that we should be at the high end or even slightly above our sales and operating income guidance for the year. We'll revisit our full year guidance as we exit Q2. This is more aligned with our historic cadence of updates and consistent with the philosophy we have as a management team to recognize early momentum but to also maintain prudence early in the year given the macro uncertainty and so much of the year is still ahead of us. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our results this quarter. They demonstrate what our team is capable of when we're laser-focused on the member and customer, disciplined on cost, and leveraging the technology investments we've made. Profits are growing, customer NPS scores are increasing, and we're running a great operation. We like our position, we like who we are, and we like where we're going. We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk a little bit more about what you saw with the lower-end consumer throughout the quarter and how you think about their contribution to comp for the rest of the year, especially when it comes to general merchandise.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Kate. It's John Furner. Good morning. I'll start. Well, first, I'd just like to say thanks to the entire team for what they did in the quarter and the execution. It's great to see so many of our associates making such a difference, and it's also been encouraging to see our store managers really focus on in-store merchandising. In the quarter, we saw big improvements all across the U.S., and that's -- that was really exciting. And in terms of the consumer, it's been pretty consistent I think is the best word we would use, consistent spending across income groups. We've had more growth, as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, on the high-end consumer. That remains true. We're very focused on value, flexibility, and convenience, and that's working across income segments. It's great to be in a position where we have store conditions that we're proud of with growth. It's great to be in a position where our pickup business is growing. And then, as we mentioned, our delivery business has now exceeded our pickup business in size, and the run rate remains strong. So, I think what we can say at this point is things have been consistent. What is also helping us is on our food categories. Well, broadly across the store, we have almost 7,000 rollbacks. That's really helping that in our food categories. We see an even larger spread between eating at home, preparing meals at home, and eating out, which we think can help Walmart over the remainder of the year.Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I have one question. I'll make it in two parts. First, to diagnose the consumer not raising yet, it sounds like you sort of want to, but there is something holding you back. Besides, it is early in the year. But curious if there's anything on the consumer side. And then the second part of this is how Doug has talked about doing both investing and then driving value today. And curious, in this environment, if you have the flexibility and even the desire to lean in even more, it looks like it could be a choppy year. So, the ability to continue to drive -- to do both, driving these impressive share gain, profit margin expansion while continuing to invest in the value proposition. Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer I'll start with the first part of the question, Simeon, and then hand it over to Doug for the second piece. On guidance, there's nothing to read into that. First, like we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter. These are strong results across the board. We think it's prudent to be patient on this performance. And as we noted, we'd update at the end of the second quarter. I think we'd all agree that we're in -- far from a certain environment around the consumer. It's -- you know, the health of the consumer is something we read about every single day. And given that we're one quarter into the year, we just want to be patient on this. But that should not take away from our conviction and the results, in our team's ability to continue to execute, and in our strategy that's continuing to drive results here.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Simeon, I think I'll be a bit repetitive with our previous conversations, but if you look back over the last few years, you'll remember that we've made price investments; we've made wage investments; and for a while, we've been telling you that we think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to that. We use the term managing our price gaps deliberately because that's how we think about it. And if we do need to make further price investments to drive growth or to ensure those baskets are in good shape, we can do that. Investing in our associates is always part of our plan. So, I think you guys can expect that we'll continue to do it. What's happening with business mix in this quarter, in particular, with inventory management, puts us in a position where we do have even more flexibility to make a variety of choices. And so, we're doing that every week and every month as we manage our business through the quarter and through the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Robby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my one question. You know, my question is that during the commentary, you know, Doug and John David, you guys talked about deflation in both general merchandise and in food and consumables. And then you talked about, you know, rollbacks in April being up 45%. And then you also talked about, you know, gross margin strength in the Walmart U.S. business. Can you help us, you know, think about that going forward? Should we -- are you in -- how are you doing that? Is it really just the advertising -- digital advertising and marketplace fulfillment and all those things are helping the gross margin so much that it's more than offsetting gross margin -- you know, core gross margin weakness? You know, maybe help us think about how to think about that going forward.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Robby, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to gross margin, we're having a conversation inside the company about the fact that the composition of it is changing, and we don't want to confuse people about what's happening. We are built. Our purpose is to help people save money and live better. And we'll manage our merchandise margins like we always have and make sure that we're providing value. But as we report gross margin, it does reflect newer businesses that are helping us mix things up. And so, we're using terms inside the company like our merchandise or product margins as distinguished from gross margins. So, maybe, John David, as we think about our future reporting, we should help kind of clarify that a bit so that people don't have the wrong perception that gross margins are going up as a result of price. They're not. If you look at rollbacks, for example, as John mentioned in the U.S. and as we mentioned earlier this morning, we're seeing a lot of rollbacks. Suppliers participate in the majority of those, but not all of them. We're going to lead on price, and we're going to manage our margins, and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been. But it's also great news that the business mix is changing, which just -- does change gross margin performance.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Robby, there's maybe three points that I'd make in response to your question. The first is that overall inflation level for the business was up about 40 basis points for the quarter. That's half the rate of increase that we saw last year. So, we're driving this revenue growth through more units, more foot traffic in stores, and feel really good about that. And that underscores that we're just becoming more relevant with consumers. So, that's the first point. Second point around gross margins is we've mentioned several times that inventory is in a much better place. One of the consequences or results of that is we see a lot less markdowns in our business. And so, that drove some of the improvement in the first quarter. The third point, and the one that I'd want to emphasize the most here, if you look at the composition of our operating income improvement year over year, roughly $900 million, about a third of that came from our newer businesses like advertising, membership, Data Ventures, and we're quite excited about that. But combined with that, we're seeing improved e-commerce losses. And one of the things that I focus a lot on in our business is what is the incremental profit from that additional revenue that we have each year. So, incremental margins. And if you just focused on our e-commerce business, in this last quarter, the incremental margins around that business were 12.5%. So, think about that, roughly three times our overall margin. There's not, to me, a more compelling data point that supports the strategy that we have and our execution around that, and importantly, how that's changing the margin profile of our business going forward.Robby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That sounds great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As hard as it is to dimension, how would you break down the factors that are driving Walmart's business that are related to its actions and strategies versus those factors that are more of a function of the environment such as high inflation and the moderating labor market? What two or three metrics is Walmart monitoring to internally gauge this? Obviously, the point of the question is trying to understand not only the sustainability of the performance if the macro does get better, but also the prospect that the outperformance could expand if the environment weakens. Thank you so much.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Michael, I'll probably ignore the external environment more than you do. I mean, we are focused on what we're doing and how we earn business with customers and members. And if you look at what's happened, you know, we've been known for price forever, but we're increasingly known for convenience. So, whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary, whether customers have more money or less money, if we're doing a good job on the items and prices and the service we provide, saving them money with pickup and delivery, for example, we can continue to grow share. So, we're merchants at the core, and we've added through the technological changes that we've made and the service changes that we've made a dimension to the business that's driving that growth. I don't know what the future looks like in terms of what pricing is going to look like, you know, a year out, two years out, and I don't really worry about that very much. I worry about our own execution.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Not much to add there, but I think the results of this quarter are really a reflection of execution across the team. We're laser-focused on the things that matter most to our customers. And one data point that I'd share, just in the U.S. business, and John might want to chime in on this, but you know, Michael, that we grade ourselves by a perfect order. And what a perfect order is for us is when you come to our virtual store online, do you find the things that you want? Do we have to replace those? Is it delivered when we say it will be delivered? Year over year, in the first quarter, we saw an almost 900-basis-point improvement in our perfect order scores. To me, that's a great example of how the team is continuing to execute, and this is resonating with customers.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's John. I'd say what -- something similar to what Doug said. We're always focused on value. And over the last few years, we've been talking about flexibility and the ability to be convenient, whether a customer wants to shop at the counter, at the curb, or delivery. And it's been exciting to see just these last few months that delivery is now exceeding the other channels, which is great, which gives the customer a lot of optionality. And then the number that Doug mentioned earlier, 4.4 billion units delivered same day, next day is exciting, and it's growing quickly. And as he also mentioned, about 20% of that is sub-three hours. And we've expanded that service earlier in the morning, later at night, so we're becoming even more convenient for individuals, for shoppers and families in a -- in terms of being able to serve all of their needs.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Those underlying input metrics were focused on around the world, in our Sam's U.S. business and international, and the commonality between the strategy's first party, e-commerce, marketplace, advertising, membership causes us to increasingly be thinking about the same thing as we build these new businesses.Kath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International Yeah. I mean, I would just add in like, you know, you look in Chile, it's probably our market that's had the least amount of growth. The economy has been tough there. As we focused on input metrics like NPS, in stock, our price perception, price gap, market share, if you focus on those things, when the economy starts to recover, the business lifts with it. While we're doing that, you're also getting in and making sure that you're building out more sustainable businesses around e-commerce. So, over 60% of our e-commerce orders are same day in Chile now. So, I think we have shown that we can prosper and thrive in kind of multiple different versions of how the economy plays out across the world. And I think, during this time, as we've focused on building out our e-commerce omni business, we're being more and more relevant to consumers in different markets.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club I think for Sam's Club, it's --Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club It's very similar. We've got -- we had a really balanced set of results in Sam's Club. And you know, as John mentioned, you know, it's all in the hands of the associates and the hard work that they did. But the value proposition is really resonating with the club model. It's great items at great value, and we will just never relent on that, and members are thanking us for it. So, Plus membership -- membership is in all-time high. Plus membership is at 54% of our member base right now, and it's up 330 basis points in the year. Why? Because we're focusing on the things that really matter: deepening digital engagement with our members, 18% e-commerce growth, and a third of our members are using Scan & Go now, which is really exciting. We're enhancing our member value proposition constantly. Prices is part of it, but value is an important component, too. I think you've all heard that we've got 120 of our stores -- of our clubs today that have got the new exit technology that's powered by AI and computer vision. That's really exciting. And then Member's Mark, which is our own brand, is really setting the bar for quality, as well as value. It's now over a third of our sales, and we are seeing really strong participation in the quarter. So, people just want really great items at really great value, and we just continue to give them that.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Krisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So, Kath, I wanted to ask you on international opportunities, in particular. The performance was really strong. I think you put up your best operating margin in over six years. So, can you talk about the sort of the main drivers behind the improvement? Just how you're thinking about international EBIT structure on a go-forward basis as you have alternative value streams that are ramping, e-commerce contribution is improving, all regions are posting very strong top-line growth. And then I just wanted to ask if there's anything you can share regarding Flipkart's contribution. How has that changed relative to the acquisition as, you know, we've been reading reports that, at one point, you're ramping up for an IPO? Thank you.Kath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International Yeah, thanks for the question, and there's quite a few components to that. I'll try and take them in chunks. First of all, I want to recognize all of our associates in international for the extraordinary strong result that we've been able to deliver over the last period. You're right, it is a really strong result. Top line was up 10.7. Bottom line or op inc was up 27%. Now, I would like to call out that that's not -- that's kind of extraordinary. There were some one-offs that went into Q1 op inc, which aren't repeatable, but we are holding to the ratio of bottom line growing faster than top line. So, we see strength in international, particularly in the way that we are turning up as kind of more of an ecosystem. So, if you look in Walmex, while we have grown the traditional business, we've been looking at how we make sure we're relevant to consumers in areas like where we had consumers that couldn't engage with us online, we've been able to provide a service that enables them to get digital connectivity. And what that means is that we now have different revenue streams coming in. I think we have over 13 million customers have engaged with us on BAIT, which is our digital connectivity. We've sold a number of health memberships. So, the composition of that business, as well as having our Cashi financial services, looks different, and that's helping drive the different kind of economics and more richer op inc. As we look at -- then at e-com across the globe, I'll probably call out China. I know I've called out the China market before, but really strong growth in Sam's Club. And that business is almost 50-50 offline and online. And while we're doing that, I think, this quarter, our bottom line grew faster than our top line in Sam's Club. So, really good strength because they've worked out a model of dark stores that give them access to a larger addressable area of the market and allow them to deliver really, really efficiently. So, our e-com omni business is growing in a sustainable way. And then as you talk about Flipkart, I think the things that we've seen with Flipkart that we really like is as their business has grown, we've seen Myntra get to EBITDA positive for the last two quarters. We've seen a growth in some premiumization. And all of that is lifting kind of the profile of the Flipkart business. And so, we're -- they're on track to the growth trajectory that we had them on, and, you know, we are looking and exploring when would be the right time to IPO that business. But there's -- that the -- there's strong growth in Flipkart and in PhonePe, and we're excited about the India market.Krisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Oliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. Within general merchandise, what categories are you most excited about? What do you see happening with innovation opportunities and/or opportunities for improvement? And as we think about general merchandise as well, the intersection of artificial intelligence, large language models, and also really changing the way consumers think about shopping, just what's on your mind for enhancing that and embracing the marketplace, as you've been doing, to continue to elevate the brand? Thank you.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club You know, general merchandise is a really core part of all of our businesses, and it's something in Sam's Club that we're really excited about. We have brands that are of extreme value, and we feel really good about that. And we've got Member's Mark, where we have incredible value and quality. And what we're seeing is that members are opting into us as a brand and renewing membership with us because we offer such high quality at such high value. So, what we're seeing is that people are continuing to opt in to us. Our units are running ahead of our sales on general merchandise because of the value. So, we feel really bullish. You think about apparel, jewelry, home, hard lines, auto, consumer electronics, we're seeing really strong unit growth in there. And it's just being followed -- it's because of value and it's because of innovation. So, you know, we remain really bullish in that space.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Oliver. It's John. Good morning. Well, I'll talk about a couple of things at -- in GM, and I think I'd first start with e-commerce. The strong performance at 22% growth is very helpful. We've picked up momentum in the marketplace. Really, really pleased to see a number -- a really large number of new sellers come on board and assortments well over -- well north of 400 million. And we spend a lot of time talking about our customer experience score, which starts with the top of the funnel, and then we work our way all the way down to conversion. And as John David mentioned earlier, one of the components is perfect order. And as you look through results, it's exciting to see more customers shopping more often, particularly in the marketplace. And then the categories that are really strong, that are standing out is apparel and fashion online. I'm really excited about what's happening in men's and women's and kids' apparel. We've seen growth there. And then our hard lines business has been strong over the quarter. It was helpful in the quarter to have Easter early and strong weather in March that gave us a strong early start. And these businesses we call omni services like tire installation, as we mentioned earlier, having your prescription ready via ordering online or cake decorating, these are all great services that are relatively unique to Walmart to be able to enable those from a digital standpoint, all the way through the store, and then deliver to people's homes. So, I really am excited about the convenience and the expansion and assortment that we're offering.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer You know, Oliver, we've punched below our weight on general merchandise, specifically in apparel and home, for a really long time, maybe forever. And I think the progress that we're seeing now is driven by the in-store remodels and in e-commerce. The marketplace is a great opportunity, but 1P will be important, too. So, we've now got tools that we can use to grow the general merchandise business that we didn't have before. As it relates to the other part of your question, I think the thing worth mentioning is the progress we're seeing on search. I'm really excited about a solution-oriented search and this migration that many of us are on to try and create a personal assistant so that we can be more anticipatory, save people more time, and help them with solutions more than what our previous search capability could do. So, I think that's going to be on a maturity curve from now until the end of the -- end of time. And generative AI has helped us step change that, and I expect that that improvement will continue.Oliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Thank you. Best regards.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Seth Sigman -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on operating expenses and thinking about the investments planned for this year. If I recall, there was a first half weighting in the guidance originally. I know some of that was a year-over-year dynamic. Any update on how to think about that? And more specific to the second quarter, it looks like you set up guidance very similar to how you set up Q1. I'm just curious, is there anything different about the opportunity in Q2? In other words, could there be a bigger step-up in spending or anything else that may limit the flow-through that we were able to see here? Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Seth. Happy to take the question. This is John David. So, when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, in last quarter's call, we talked about the first half of the year, we'd likely see that sales would outpace operating income. Maybe that's unlikely now with these results in the first quarter, but we did have some planned investments in the second quarter related to some technology investments. We've also got a little higher depreciation year over year. In terms of the opportunity in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, there are a couple of things I want to call out in the first quarter that likely would not repeat themselves, but I don't want to take away from the team's strong performance. The first of those is just strong seasonal events in the first -- in international that helped us, and we also lapped a LIFO charge last year at Sam's, which contributed to some of the operating income growth. Those are likely not to repeat themselves. But -- so the possibility for outperformance in 2Q may be less than what it was in the first quarter. That said, I don't want to take away the headline here, and we feel really good about how the team is operating and feel really good about what the year holds for us and the opportunity to outperform the guidance that we've given.Seth Sigman -- Barclays -- Analyst OK. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to just go back to business mix. I guess, with the continued strong growth in marketplace, I guess when I -- when you look at the performance of general merchandise and Walmart U.S., that marketplace sales would obviously skew higher toward those discretionary categories. You noted the 420 million SKUs there. So, I guess the question is, is the impact of 3P marketplace growth at all starting to cannibalize, maybe in a good way, the general merchandise comps that you provide and -- or would the performance of general merchandise be stronger if you looked at it more holistically from a total GMV standpoint?John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Let me start on this, and others may want to jump in. So, first of all, as you think about the mix of our business, we've continued to have a headwind as consumer wallets have been stretched. And for us, that's resulted in about a 100-basis-point shift away from general merchandise to other categories of our business in the first quarter. We expect that to continue or some magnitude of that for the balance of the year. But to me, the real story here around general merchandise is the progress that we're making in our marketplace. And so, while general merchandise is, you know, call it, roughly flat, there are categories like pets and beauty, where the growth in the marketplace is in excess of 30%. There are other categories like furniture, sporting goods that are in excess of 20%. And I think this shows that consumers -- customers are coming to us, thinking of us very differently than what they have in the past, and it's also an indication of how and where we're gaining share in our business. So, general merchandise, being able to offer third-party assortment, is giving our customers a lot more options than what they've had in the past.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer I think general merchandise mix was impacted by food inflation to a degree. You know, when food shot up to mid-double digits, there are a lot of customers that had their paycheck allocated in that direction. And now that food pricing has calmed down some and we've got rollbacks happening in food and you've got a deflationary situation with GM, you've got the opportunity, given the elasticity, to grow more units, which we're doing. And the fact that we're growing share feels good. So, I don't get too caught up, Kelly, on whether the sales come through stores, clubs, first party, or marketplace. We just want to have what people are looking for, and we'll manage the mix on the other end of it in a way that generates more profitability, which is what you're seeing in this quarter.Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst Hey. Thank you, guys. You mentioned that within Walmart U.S. that your share gains were led by the higher-income households, I believe. Curious how you define that. What percent of your customer base the higher-income households comprised and how you're targeting that consumer? And also curious how is that consumers' engagement with Walmart changed. Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, this is John David. I'll start. So, we define where we stratify the income groups roughly as $50,000 and below, $50,000 to $100,000, and then $100,000 and above. And as a general rule, our customer base breaks down about a third in each group. And so, in terms of what we're doing to be more attractive to that higher-income household, I think this is the -- really, the story or the word we've been using here is convenience. We are not just a play for value anymore. We talked about the number of units that we've shipped in the last 12 months, which is on par with any e-commerce player in the world. That shows that customers are coming to us and we're a consideration where we haven't been before. And convenience matters to someone irrespective of what your paycheck is, irrespective of what your income level is, and we expect that to be durable. We don't expect that to change.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Yeah. John David, I'd just add to that, it's also been encouraging to see the improvements in fresh food. We've definitely experienced benefit from improvements in quality. The supply chain has gotten tighter. Many of you have seen the work we're doing in supply chain. But produce has been really exciting to see the progress over the last couple of years. The same sort of quality improvements are coming through in the meat department. And you can see that in the types of items and categories that we're selling in store and those in pickup and delivery. And in the delivery business where we are stronger with higher-income consumer, that's where we've seen a lot of growth. I'm really excited, Doug, what you mentioned earlier is bettergoods is being a way to sell better quality, better taste profiles, and at values that really matter. Seventy percent of the items under $5 is exciting. And that appeals to all income groups. And so, if you're trying to feed a family of four or five or six and prices in restaurants have gone up and in Walmart and it's beginning to come down, and we're really proud of the rollbacks. I think our value message is strong, and having the ability to deliver flexibly is going to work out really well for us.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer We're not trying to chase higher-income cohort sales. We just offer value. If you look at what's happened historically, people with higher incomes have shopped Walmart. They've just been selective in their -- in the categories that they buy and the items that they buy. So, if we offer them the right items at the right prices, whether that's in store, first party, or marketplace, they'll respond to that. And so, as we've been able to expand our assortment online, we can appeal to more people. And then you layer on the convenience dimension, and you get a good outcome.Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you, guys. Good luck.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a really great quarter. I'm just wondering if you can discuss trends you're seeing within general merchandise between smaller ticket, shorter replacement items versus higher ticket, longer replacement items, and if any shifts in spending within the categories reflect anything about whether the consumers are making any incremental changes in their discretionary spending. And just as a quick follow-up, just curious if there was any deviation or big change in trend throughout the quarter by month. Thank you.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Yeah. Chuck, good morning. It's John. I'll take it. I think the best way to describe the consumers, it's been remarkably consistent over the last couple of years. Mix has changed, but hasn't changed that much. We've seen growth in both brands and private brands. We have seen a wide range of price point selling in the quarter. March was a strong month given Easter was in the month. We had leap year in February. That was also -- helped make it stronger. So, the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that surprising. It was strong in February, strong again in March. Weather was favorable in March, a little bit colder. And then April was softer without Easter in it. But we walked out of the quarter into to the month of May with similar trends that we've been seeing. So, the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that different than we expected. I think you should look forward that the consumers are consistent. Our inventory is in good shape. Our merchants, we said this a few minutes ago, they have the ability to mix out. They're managing their price gaps and value. They're managing additional margins. Their markdowns have been lower due to stronger inventory management. A little bit of improvement this year in shrinkage from private from the previous years. We've been going up for the last three years, and it's good to see that starting to come down in some places in the country. But we'll mix this out. Our merchant team, they've done this for a while. And in any situation for the consumer, we want to focus on value and be there for them, and we'll manage the mix on the backside.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Thanks, John.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So, just going back to the commentary on Walmart+, it sounds like it's growing double digits. As we look at the backdrop out there for membership and subscriptions, you're clearly seeing a more crowded landscape. So, just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the value proposition today and then further opportunities to differentiate Walmart+ going forward.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hi, Rupesh. It's John. Pleased with the progress of Walmart+. It is an important part of what we do, and it is a great way for customers to save time and save money. By joining Walmart+, you get access to unlimited deliveries, which is great. And, you know, I talked to a lot of people all over the country that use it all the time. It's also been important for us to improve the perfect order. As we mentioned earlier, we launched Walmart+ in 2020 at a time when the supply chain was difficult, and so the continued momentum and improvements and being able to fulfill customers' orders with what they ordered when they ordered has been important. But again, it's an important part of what we do. We think it's a great solution for customers, and it's been exciting to see the progress.Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Greg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. I'd like to pivot a bit back to the top line, and I think you said inflation was 40 bips in the quarter. If you look at your guidance for the rest of the year, do you expect it to settle at that kind of low level or even fall further?John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Greg, we expect it to be relatively close to what we saw in the current quarter. You know, it's a mix across the baskets. We've seen general merchandise be more deflationary, but consumables and food are hovering slightly above, flat to up one. So, we generally expect it to be in this level.Greg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you all for joining the call. Again, thanks to our associates for a really strong quarter. When I think about the headlines from the quarter, what goes through my mind is, first, the e-commerce growth. I think the progress we're making on convenience for customers is a big deal, and that's happening through our store fulfillment, as well as through fulfillment centers. The marketplace is growing, and that brings along with it growth in advertising and membership. It was great to see both of those up 24%. Second headline is related to really good inventory management. And the third headline is related to pricing. I think the number of rollbacks that we have and the value that we're offering to customers and members is resonating, and those really set this quarter apart. Big picture, our thought is the same as it has been. We're going to be able to grow sales because we're positioned to serve people how they want to be served. We're going to grow profit faster than sales because of business mix. And we're going to be able to grow returns as we make the right capital investments. So, we'll be really consistent as it relates to that through the year, and we appreciate your time and attention.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Steph Wissink -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsDoug McMillon -- Chief Executive OfficerJohn David Rainey -- Chief Financial OfficerKate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystJohn Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart USSimeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystRobby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystMichael Lasser -- UBS -- AnalystKath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart InternationalChris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's ClubKrisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- AnalystSeth Sigman -- Barclays -- AnalystKelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystPaul Lejuez -- Citi -- AnalystChuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- AnalystRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGreg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n",

      "Walmart (WMT 1.00%)Q1 2025 Earnings CallMay 16, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to Walmart's first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, senior vice president, investor relations. Steph, you may now begin.Steph Wissink -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our home office in Bentonville are Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug and John David will first share their views on the quarter, and then we'll open the line to your questions. During the Q&A portion, we will be joined by our segment CEOs: John Furner from Walmart U.S., Kath McLay from Walmart International, and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. For additional details on our results, including highlights by segment, please see our earnings release and accompanying presentation on our website. We will make every effort to answer as many questions as we can in the hour we have scheduled for this call. As a courtesy, please limit yourself to one question.Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that wraps my intro. We're ready to begin. Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered a great quarter to start the year. Our results were stronger than we anticipated, with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit up 12.9% in constant currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the business is driven by growth in units sold and transaction counts, as well as market share gains, including general merchandise. These are not inflation-driven results. In the U.S., like-for-like sales inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter, including mid-single-digit deflation in general merchandise and low single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers, we're making progress lowering prices. Our rollback count is up, and customers are responding to our price leadership. The first highlight I'd like to call out is the improvement in customer experience scores. That has a lot to do with our associates. I get to visit with a lot of them as I travel. This quarter, I've been in stores and clubs in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Toronto, Nashville, Los Angeles, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Dallas. And before we get too far into the conversation about our performance, I want to thank all our associates everywhere. They deserve all the credit. They're managing the things we've always managed while simultaneously building new capabilities and driving change. Here's what they're doing to drive our business. First, we're providing value. Low prices on quality merchandise are always important to our customers and members. Our combination of everyday low prices, plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating. During the holiday, we offered a basket of Easter items with a lower price than a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Customers responded, and we saw strong sell-throughs. Our merchants are doing a great job, including managing inventory, where we finished down 2.7% globally. Second, we have the selection people are looking for. In the U.S., the number of marketplace sellers grew about 36% for the quarter, with the SKU count now sitting at more than 420 million. In Mexico, the number of marketplace sellers grew by more than 50%, with SKU count up nearly 80%. More often, our customers are finding what they're looking for when they shop on our app or site. The e-commerce penetration is up in all our markets. Third, we're improving the experience of shopping with us. Our store remodels look good and are performing well. Plus, our curbside pickup and delivery capabilities are improving, as indicated by our customer experience metrics. Globally, we completed nearly 70 remodels during the quarter, and we're on track to do more than 900 this year. We're making it more convenient to shop with us, and our customers and members are rewarding us with growth as we save them time. We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this year while managing our price gaps and investing in our associates at the same time. This quarter's results were driven by a combination of strong core performance and the growth of our newer businesses. As it relates to the core, strong same-store sales growth, combined with good inventory management, resulted in strong profit flow-through. In our newer businesses, advertising and membership were both up 24%. Today, we announced that we're expanding our data analytics and insights product, Walmart Luminate, into Mexico and Canada. Our technology team continues to deliver the innovation that helps us drive our business. We're bringing new experiences to life like generative AI-driven product search that helps our customers shop more intuitively. The team continues to build and improve the platforms for marketplace and data that we're using across countries, and they're building and improving the operating system that enables us to create a more intelligent, flexible, and automated supply chain. The implementation of our automated storage and retrieval systems in our DCs and FCs is on track, and we're as enthusiastic about the impact of that work as we've ever been. Turning to our segments. In Walmart U.S., we recently announced a new private brand in food called bettergoods. It's our largest food private brand release in 20 years. The brand focuses on today's trends and premium quality. But at the same time, 70% of bettergoods items are priced under $5. This is the type of quality and value that will resonate with customers across income spectrums. We also introduced on-demand early morning delivery to customer doorsteps as early as 7 a.m. and as quickly as 30 minutes. Globally, same-day delivery is available from more than 6,500 locations. In Walmart U.S., over the last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered same or next day, with about 20% of those delivered in under three hours. Delivery times are getting faster, and the cost to delivery is coming down at the same time. During the quarter, we made the necessary but difficult decision to close our U.S. healthcare clinics. There were a number of aspects that were going well, and we really want to be part of the solution to improving healthcare in this country. But the reality is that given reimbursement rates and costs to serve, we could no longer see a path to achieving an acceptable level of profitability, and we're committed to being disciplined with our investments. We're grateful to our associates that worked in this area. They did their part. We'll continue to build our pharmacy and optical businesses, and we'll find ways for our pharmacists to help, as they've done with immunizations and vaccinations. Earlier this week, we also shared decisions to eliminate some home office roles and reduce the amount of remote work. The vast majority of our home office associates have been back together in offices since we came back from the pandemic, and we want to see even more of that. Being in person is important. Our culture is stronger when we're together. We make decisions faster, we're more creative, and we help develop the next generation of talent. We'll continue to make changes to ensure we're best positioned to serve customers and support our store, club, and supply chain associates. Moving to Walmart International. We continue to deliver strong results, with double-digit growth in sales and profit, lifting our company growth rates. Strength was broad-based, led by Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Results for the quarter included strong growth in e-commerce, led by store fulfilled orders and marketplace. We saw improved sales growth in general merchandise categories as we focused on celebrations across the world like Chinese New Year, Easter, and Walmart Canada's 30th anniversary. Like the U.S., the international team is improving speed of delivery across markets. Same-day delivery orders in India grew by over 150% in the quarter and is now available across 20 major cities. One-hour delivery in China grew to 55 million orders as customers sought convenience during Chinese New Year. And in Chile, 60% of e-commerce orders are delivered same day. With Sam's Club U.S., it's exciting to see how the team is using computer vision to make it faster for members using Scan & Go to leave the building once they're done shopping. I'm referring to the computer vision and AI-powered exit technology that allows members to leave the club without having to stand in line to get the receipt check that we announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Since then, we've deployed it in about 20% of our clubs, and we're on track to have it in all U.S. clubs by year-end. In addition to this being better for members, the technology identifies more items than we could with our previous process. This is a great example of people-led, tech-powered, solving for technology that benefits the member experience. It was a strong start to the year. We'll remain focused on improving customer and member experiences, being great merchants, building our newer businesses, and improving returns. With that, I'll hand it to John David to share more about the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Doug. Our strong results this quarter clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver on our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. This quarter's results reflect strong execution from the team across virtually every aspect of our business, share gains and improving NPS scores from our members and customers that are increasingly looking for value and convenience, and the power of our omni retail model. I'll discuss our quarterly results using our framework of growth, margins, and returns. We experienced ongoing sales strength, with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations. We're growing traffic and units, and our inventories are in excellent shape. We're on a multiyear journey to reshape our profit profile, and operating income growth trajectory in this quarter reflects the benefits of improved margins in our core retail operations, as well as contributions from business mix. We're investing in areas that have strong capital returns like automation, store remodels, and digital tools and technologies. Combined, these investments are widening our competitive advantages, providing us levers to also invest in people and price while achieving our sales and margin objectives. Before I provide more color behind the strength of our financial results, I want to remind you that there is a supplemental presentation on our IR website, with additional information beyond my remarks. First quarter, total net sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis, ahead of our guidance of 4% to 5% growth. As a reminder, the leap year this year contributes approximately 1 point to our year-over-year sales growth. International led the enterprise with constant currency sales growth of 10.7%, reflecting strength in Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Across markets, seasonal events were strong, and we're encouraged by early improvements in general merchandise sales. International e-commerce sales were up 19% as we continue to expand our capabilities. In Canada, the majority of our marketplace growth came from items serviced by Walmart Fulfillment Services. And in India, Flipkart's same-day delivery became available to millions more customers as they expanded the offering to 20 cities. Walmart U.S. also delivered better-than-expected growth, with comp sales up 3.8%, including strong e-commerce growth of 22%, led by store-fulfilled, pickup and delivery, marketplace, and advertising. Traffic and sales growth were strong across both stores and digital channels, and we're pleased with the unit growth. We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts, with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of the share gains. Sam's U.S. comp sales, ex fuel, were also strong at 4.4%. The Sam's team continues to make progress on quality and value with Member's Mark, our private brand. The team is doing a great job of being on top of product trends with the brand. Member's Mark drove high single-digit growth in Q1 and is a growing reason why members join and renew, alongside digitally enabled solutions such as Scan & Go and curbside pickup. Next to sales, gross profit growth was the key driver of upside in Q1. Consolidated gross margin expanded 42 basis points, led by Walmart U.S. Across segments, we benefited from lower markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management and favorable business mix, enabling strong margin flow-through from sales. Consolidated adjusted operating income grew 12.9% in constant currency, more than 700 basis points higher than our sales growth. This reflects better-than-expected sales growth and higher gross margins and membership income. This was partially offset by expense deleverage in our U.S. segments related to higher variable pay expenses from our outperformance. Walmart U.S. was the primary driver of outperformance, but all segments contributed to operating income growing faster than sales. Taking a closer look at margins. As we continue to work closely with our suppliers to lower cost, we're managing our Walmart U.S. pricing, aligned to competitive price gaps, and customers are responding favorably, resulting in sustained sales growth and higher gross margins. Our price gaps to the retail market remained strong. Improved inventory management and favorable business mix allowed us to optimize our pricing on everyday essentials, and we're investing further in value within our private brands. Our rollback program is driving customer engagement and supporting our volume growth, with grocery rollback counts up 45% year over year in April. Carrying forward the success we saw last year in our seasonal programs, we're using celebrations and festive events to reinforce our value proposition, and customers are responding. Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, and Easter drove stronger sales across categories, including general merchandise. We're also working with suppliers to bring innovation to U.S. customers while leaning into our own private brands as sources of value, quality, and newness. As a result, we've continued to see strong momentum in private brand sales, with grocery penetration up 30 basis points in Q1. While private brand penetration is in the low 20s as a percent of sales, more than half of all customer grocery baskets over the last year have had a private brand in them. Our inventory levels continue to come down, with Walmart U.S. declining about 4% and Sam's down nearly 5% at quarter-end, while we sustain strong sales and healthy in-stock rates. Having the right inventory in the right categories and the right places has allowed us to not only minimize markdown activity but also support higher in-stock levels, with goods flowing more smoothly through distribution centers and to stores. Importantly, the business is realizing efficiencies while both customer and associate NPS scores are rising. Global e-commerce growth was 21% in Q1, and e-commerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in the U.S. net delivery cost per order, improving nearly 40%. More customers are shopping with us more often across more categories, moving us along the pathway of delivery density and transaction margins that give us clear visibility into profitability in this channel over time. Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix as they're spending more of their paychecks on nondiscretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it's consistent with our expectations. Our Walmart U.S. team is executing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility of our growing e-commerce brand assortments in fashion, home, and electronics. We have the opportunity to grow general merchandise sales in stores with our first-party e-commerce assortment and especially with our marketplace. We were encouraged to see share gains in fashion, home, and hard lines in Q1. In addition, marketplace sales in categories such as furniture, sporting goods, kids apparel, and home grew more than 20%. In addition to sales growth and gross margin improvement, the reshaping of our profit composition is an exciting part of our strategy. We're enhancing capabilities in higher-margin growth drivers such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights and seeing the corresponding improvement in our business mix. Global advertising grew 24%, led by 26% growth from Walmart Connect in the U.S. and international's 27% growth. Walmart's U.S. ad sales reflected more than 50% growth from marketplace sellers, while overall active advertiser counts increased nearly 19%. Sam's ad business now has 30% more active advertisers versus last year. We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club U.S. reached another record high level for member counts and Plus member penetration, resulting in membership income growth over 13%. Sam's China member count grew 25%, with increasing active and renewal rates. In addition, Walmart+ continued to grow double digits as members engage with us more frequently and spend more than other customers. For marketplace, within international, all markets grew double digits, led by Flipkart and Walmex, reflecting the strength we're experiencing across markets. In the U.S., Walmart's marketplace delivered strong results, aided by 36% more sellers on our platform, with 28% of sellers using our marketplace fulfillment services. To give you an example of the benefit of our omni model, in April, we launched a new service enabling customers to order from an extended assortment of nearly 40,000 tires on our marketplace and have them installed at one of our 2,300 auto care centers and stores in the U.S. It's a great example of how we're leveraging our unique omni capabilities to remove friction for customers. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to see strong demand from clients for their insights on consumer behavior and trends and our omnichannel operations. In Q1, this business doubled versus last year. In April, we announced a new self-serve integration to make it easier for supplier advertisers to combine Walmart Luminate's insights with Walmart Connect's closed-loop omnichannel retail media solutions to help drive product, brand, and category sales. This is the first time we're bringing these two solutions together, creating greater cohesion between both offerings and helping suppliers deliver more relevant shopping experiences for our customers. Beyond executing on our operating strategies, you're also seeing a discipline from us to address areas of our business that have not performed as well. You should expect this discipline to continue, concentrating our efforts and capital on clear drivers of incremental value. This requires us to be bold enough to step back from areas that, at one time, were clear opportunities or were strategically or financially accretive, but now have diminishing value. It was through this lens that we made the decision to close all 51 Walmart Health Centers, as Doug mentioned. Total business reorganization cost resulted in a charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Wrapping up Q1 results. Below-the-line items reflected slightly higher interest expense on relatively flat net debt balances and a lower tax rate year over year, based on changes in the fair value of our equity investments. Adjusted EPS of $0.60 per share compared favorably to our guidance of $0.49 to $0.52. Turning to guidance. Our team is executing at a very high level. Q1 results exceeded our expectations for both sales and operating income growth. And while it might be a little much to expect every quarter to be this good, we feel really good about the performance, and it demonstrates how this business can perform when we're firing on all cylinders. Consumer economic conditions have been relatively consistent since the start of the year. Many of the value-seeking behaviors we witnessed last year have continued, particularly around seasonal events. Our focus on providing customers with value and convenience is resonating, and we're gaining share. That said, we're one quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty, and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We currently expect Q2 sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% and for operating income growth in line with that at roughly 3% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.62 and $0.65 per share. In Q2, we expect operating income growth to be impacted by timing of tech and wage investments. Combining Q1 results with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance would suggest first half sales would grow nearly 5% and operating income would grow about 8%. We feel really good about our start to the year, and our outlook for the second half is consistent with 90 days ago. Our Q1 results and the midpoint of our 2Q guidance suggest that we should be at the high end or even slightly above our sales and operating income guidance for the year. We'll revisit our full year guidance as we exit Q2. This is more aligned with our historic cadence of updates and consistent with the philosophy we have as a management team to recognize early momentum but to also maintain prudence early in the year given the macro uncertainty and so much of the year is still ahead of us. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our results this quarter. They demonstrate what our team is capable of when we're laser-focused on the member and customer, disciplined on cost, and leveraging the technology investments we've made. Profits are growing, customer NPS scores are increasing, and we're running a great operation. We like our position, we like who we are, and we like where we're going. We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk a little bit more about what you saw with the lower-end consumer throughout the quarter and how you think about their contribution to comp for the rest of the year, especially when it comes to general merchandise.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Kate. It's John Furner. Good morning. I'll start. Well, first, I'd just like to say thanks to the entire team for what they did in the quarter and the execution. It's great to see so many of our associates making such a difference, and it's also been encouraging to see our store managers really focus on in-store merchandising. In the quarter, we saw big improvements all across the U.S., and that's -- that was really exciting. And in terms of the consumer, it's been pretty consistent I think is the best word we would use, consistent spending across income groups. We've had more growth, as we mentioned in the earlier remarks, on the high-end consumer. That remains true. We're very focused on value, flexibility, and convenience, and that's working across income segments. It's great to be in a position where we have store conditions that we're proud of with growth. It's great to be in a position where our pickup business is growing. And then, as we mentioned, our delivery business has now exceeded our pickup business in size, and the run rate remains strong. So, I think what we can say at this point is things have been consistent. What is also helping us is on our food categories. Well, broadly across the store, we have almost 7,000 rollbacks. That's really helping that in our food categories. We see an even larger spread between eating at home, preparing meals at home, and eating out, which we think can help Walmart over the remainder of the year.Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I have one question. I'll make it in two parts. First, to diagnose the consumer not raising yet, it sounds like you sort of want to, but there is something holding you back. Besides, it is early in the year. But curious if there's anything on the consumer side. And then the second part of this is how Doug has talked about doing both investing and then driving value today. And curious, in this environment, if you have the flexibility and even the desire to lean in even more, it looks like it could be a choppy year. So, the ability to continue to drive -- to do both, driving these impressive share gain, profit margin expansion while continuing to invest in the value proposition. Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer I'll start with the first part of the question, Simeon, and then hand it over to Doug for the second piece. On guidance, there's nothing to read into that. First, like we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter. These are strong results across the board. We think it's prudent to be patient on this performance. And as we noted, we'd update at the end of the second quarter. I think we'd all agree that we're in -- far from a certain environment around the consumer. It's -- you know, the health of the consumer is something we read about every single day. And given that we're one quarter into the year, we just want to be patient on this. But that should not take away from our conviction and the results, in our team's ability to continue to execute, and in our strategy that's continuing to drive results here.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Simeon, I think I'll be a bit repetitive with our previous conversations, but if you look back over the last few years, you'll remember that we've made price investments; we've made wage investments; and for a while, we've been telling you that we think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to that. We use the term managing our price gaps deliberately because that's how we think about it. And if we do need to make further price investments to drive growth or to ensure those baskets are in good shape, we can do that. Investing in our associates is always part of our plan. So, I think you guys can expect that we'll continue to do it. What's happening with business mix in this quarter, in particular, with inventory management, puts us in a position where we do have even more flexibility to make a variety of choices. And so, we're doing that every week and every month as we manage our business through the quarter and through the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Robby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my one question. You know, my question is that during the commentary, you know, Doug and John David, you guys talked about deflation in both general merchandise and in food and consumables. And then you talked about, you know, rollbacks in April being up 45%. And then you also talked about, you know, gross margin strength in the Walmart U.S. business. Can you help us, you know, think about that going forward? Should we -- are you in -- how are you doing that? Is it really just the advertising -- digital advertising and marketplace fulfillment and all those things are helping the gross margin so much that it's more than offsetting gross margin -- you know, core gross margin weakness? You know, maybe help us think about how to think about that going forward.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Robby, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to gross margin, we're having a conversation inside the company about the fact that the composition of it is changing, and we don't want to confuse people about what's happening. We are built. Our purpose is to help people save money and live better. And we'll manage our merchandise margins like we always have and make sure that we're providing value. But as we report gross margin, it does reflect newer businesses that are helping us mix things up. And so, we're using terms inside the company like our merchandise or product margins as distinguished from gross margins. So, maybe, John David, as we think about our future reporting, we should help kind of clarify that a bit so that people don't have the wrong perception that gross margins are going up as a result of price. They're not. If you look at rollbacks, for example, as John mentioned in the U.S. and as we mentioned earlier this morning, we're seeing a lot of rollbacks. Suppliers participate in the majority of those, but not all of them. We're going to lead on price, and we're going to manage our margins, and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been. But it's also great news that the business mix is changing, which just -- does change gross margin performance.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Robby, there's maybe three points that I'd make in response to your question. The first is that overall inflation level for the business was up about 40 basis points for the quarter. That's half the rate of increase that we saw last year. So, we're driving this revenue growth through more units, more foot traffic in stores, and feel really good about that. And that underscores that we're just becoming more relevant with consumers. So, that's the first point. Second point around gross margins is we've mentioned several times that inventory is in a much better place. One of the consequences or results of that is we see a lot less markdowns in our business. And so, that drove some of the improvement in the first quarter. The third point, and the one that I'd want to emphasize the most here, if you look at the composition of our operating income improvement year over year, roughly $900 million, about a third of that came from our newer businesses like advertising, membership, Data Ventures, and we're quite excited about that. But combined with that, we're seeing improved e-commerce losses. And one of the things that I focus a lot on in our business is what is the incremental profit from that additional revenue that we have each year. So, incremental margins. And if you just focused on our e-commerce business, in this last quarter, the incremental margins around that business were 12.5%. So, think about that, roughly three times our overall margin. There's not, to me, a more compelling data point that supports the strategy that we have and our execution around that, and importantly, how that's changing the margin profile of our business going forward.Robby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That sounds great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As hard as it is to dimension, how would you break down the factors that are driving Walmart's business that are related to its actions and strategies versus those factors that are more of a function of the environment such as high inflation and the moderating labor market? What two or three metrics is Walmart monitoring to internally gauge this? Obviously, the point of the question is trying to understand not only the sustainability of the performance if the macro does get better, but also the prospect that the outperformance could expand if the environment weakens. Thank you so much.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Michael, I'll probably ignore the external environment more than you do. I mean, we are focused on what we're doing and how we earn business with customers and members. And if you look at what's happened, you know, we've been known for price forever, but we're increasingly known for convenience. So, whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary, whether customers have more money or less money, if we're doing a good job on the items and prices and the service we provide, saving them money with pickup and delivery, for example, we can continue to grow share. So, we're merchants at the core, and we've added through the technological changes that we've made and the service changes that we've made a dimension to the business that's driving that growth. I don't know what the future looks like in terms of what pricing is going to look like, you know, a year out, two years out, and I don't really worry about that very much. I worry about our own execution.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Not much to add there, but I think the results of this quarter are really a reflection of execution across the team. We're laser-focused on the things that matter most to our customers. And one data point that I'd share, just in the U.S. business, and John might want to chime in on this, but you know, Michael, that we grade ourselves by a perfect order. And what a perfect order is for us is when you come to our virtual store online, do you find the things that you want? Do we have to replace those? Is it delivered when we say it will be delivered? Year over year, in the first quarter, we saw an almost 900-basis-point improvement in our perfect order scores. To me, that's a great example of how the team is continuing to execute, and this is resonating with customers.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's John. I'd say what -- something similar to what Doug said. We're always focused on value. And over the last few years, we've been talking about flexibility and the ability to be convenient, whether a customer wants to shop at the counter, at the curb, or delivery. And it's been exciting to see just these last few months that delivery is now exceeding the other channels, which is great, which gives the customer a lot of optionality. And then the number that Doug mentioned earlier, 4.4 billion units delivered same day, next day is exciting, and it's growing quickly. And as he also mentioned, about 20% of that is sub-three hours. And we've expanded that service earlier in the morning, later at night, so we're becoming even more convenient for individuals, for shoppers and families in a -- in terms of being able to serve all of their needs.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Those underlying input metrics were focused on around the world, in our Sam's U.S. business and international, and the commonality between the strategy's first party, e-commerce, marketplace, advertising, membership causes us to increasingly be thinking about the same thing as we build these new businesses.Kath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International Yeah. I mean, I would just add in like, you know, you look in Chile, it's probably our market that's had the least amount of growth. The economy has been tough there. As we focused on input metrics like NPS, in stock, our price perception, price gap, market share, if you focus on those things, when the economy starts to recover, the business lifts with it. While we're doing that, you're also getting in and making sure that you're building out more sustainable businesses around e-commerce. So, over 60% of our e-commerce orders are same day in Chile now. So, I think we have shown that we can prosper and thrive in kind of multiple different versions of how the economy plays out across the world. And I think, during this time, as we've focused on building out our e-commerce omni business, we're being more and more relevant to consumers in different markets.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club I think for Sam's Club, it's --Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club It's very similar. We've got -- we had a really balanced set of results in Sam's Club. And you know, as John mentioned, you know, it's all in the hands of the associates and the hard work that they did. But the value proposition is really resonating with the club model. It's great items at great value, and we will just never relent on that, and members are thanking us for it. So, Plus membership -- membership is in all-time high. Plus membership is at 54% of our member base right now, and it's up 330 basis points in the year. Why? Because we're focusing on the things that really matter: deepening digital engagement with our members, 18% e-commerce growth, and a third of our members are using Scan & Go now, which is really exciting. We're enhancing our member value proposition constantly. Prices is part of it, but value is an important component, too. I think you've all heard that we've got 120 of our stores -- of our clubs today that have got the new exit technology that's powered by AI and computer vision. That's really exciting. And then Member's Mark, which is our own brand, is really setting the bar for quality, as well as value. It's now over a third of our sales, and we are seeing really strong participation in the quarter. So, people just want really great items at really great value, and we just continue to give them that.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Krisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So, Kath, I wanted to ask you on international opportunities, in particular. The performance was really strong. I think you put up your best operating margin in over six years. So, can you talk about the sort of the main drivers behind the improvement? Just how you're thinking about international EBIT structure on a go-forward basis as you have alternative value streams that are ramping, e-commerce contribution is improving, all regions are posting very strong top-line growth. And then I just wanted to ask if there's anything you can share regarding Flipkart's contribution. How has that changed relative to the acquisition as, you know, we've been reading reports that, at one point, you're ramping up for an IPO? Thank you.Kath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International Yeah, thanks for the question, and there's quite a few components to that. I'll try and take them in chunks. First of all, I want to recognize all of our associates in international for the extraordinary strong result that we've been able to deliver over the last period. You're right, it is a really strong result. Top line was up 10.7. Bottom line or op inc was up 27%. Now, I would like to call out that that's not -- that's kind of extraordinary. There were some one-offs that went into Q1 op inc, which aren't repeatable, but we are holding to the ratio of bottom line growing faster than top line. So, we see strength in international, particularly in the way that we are turning up as kind of more of an ecosystem. So, if you look in Walmex, while we have grown the traditional business, we've been looking at how we make sure we're relevant to consumers in areas like where we had consumers that couldn't engage with us online, we've been able to provide a service that enables them to get digital connectivity. And what that means is that we now have different revenue streams coming in. I think we have over 13 million customers have engaged with us on BAIT, which is our digital connectivity. We've sold a number of health memberships. So, the composition of that business, as well as having our Cashi financial services, looks different, and that's helping drive the different kind of economics and more richer op inc. As we look at -- then at e-com across the globe, I'll probably call out China. I know I've called out the China market before, but really strong growth in Sam's Club. And that business is almost 50-50 offline and online. And while we're doing that, I think, this quarter, our bottom line grew faster than our top line in Sam's Club. So, really good strength because they've worked out a model of dark stores that give them access to a larger addressable area of the market and allow them to deliver really, really efficiently. So, our e-com omni business is growing in a sustainable way. And then as you talk about Flipkart, I think the things that we've seen with Flipkart that we really like is as their business has grown, we've seen Myntra get to EBITDA positive for the last two quarters. We've seen a growth in some premiumization. And all of that is lifting kind of the profile of the Flipkart business. And so, we're -- they're on track to the growth trajectory that we had them on, and, you know, we are looking and exploring when would be the right time to IPO that business. But there's -- that the -- there's strong growth in Flipkart and in PhonePe, and we're excited about the India market.Krisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Oliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Hi. Thank you. Within general merchandise, what categories are you most excited about? What do you see happening with innovation opportunities and/or opportunities for improvement? And as we think about general merchandise as well, the intersection of artificial intelligence, large language models, and also really changing the way consumers think about shopping, just what's on your mind for enhancing that and embracing the marketplace, as you've been doing, to continue to elevate the brand? Thank you.Chris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club You know, general merchandise is a really core part of all of our businesses, and it's something in Sam's Club that we're really excited about. We have brands that are of extreme value, and we feel really good about that. And we've got Member's Mark, where we have incredible value and quality. And what we're seeing is that members are opting into us as a brand and renewing membership with us because we offer such high quality at such high value. So, what we're seeing is that people are continuing to opt in to us. Our units are running ahead of our sales on general merchandise because of the value. So, we feel really bullish. You think about apparel, jewelry, home, hard lines, auto, consumer electronics, we're seeing really strong unit growth in there. And it's just being followed -- it's because of value and it's because of innovation. So, you know, we remain really bullish in that space.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hey, Oliver. It's John. Good morning. Well, I'll talk about a couple of things at -- in GM, and I think I'd first start with e-commerce. The strong performance at 22% growth is very helpful. We've picked up momentum in the marketplace. Really, really pleased to see a number -- a really large number of new sellers come on board and assortments well over -- well north of 400 million. And we spend a lot of time talking about our customer experience score, which starts with the top of the funnel, and then we work our way all the way down to conversion. And as John David mentioned earlier, one of the components is perfect order. And as you look through results, it's exciting to see more customers shopping more often, particularly in the marketplace. And then the categories that are really strong, that are standing out is apparel and fashion online. I'm really excited about what's happening in men's and women's and kids' apparel. We've seen growth there. And then our hard lines business has been strong over the quarter. It was helpful in the quarter to have Easter early and strong weather in March that gave us a strong early start. And these businesses we call omni services like tire installation, as we mentioned earlier, having your prescription ready via ordering online or cake decorating, these are all great services that are relatively unique to Walmart to be able to enable those from a digital standpoint, all the way through the store, and then deliver to people's homes. So, I really am excited about the convenience and the expansion and assortment that we're offering.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer You know, Oliver, we've punched below our weight on general merchandise, specifically in apparel and home, for a really long time, maybe forever. And I think the progress that we're seeing now is driven by the in-store remodels and in e-commerce. The marketplace is a great opportunity, but 1P will be important, too. So, we've now got tools that we can use to grow the general merchandise business that we didn't have before. As it relates to the other part of your question, I think the thing worth mentioning is the progress we're seeing on search. I'm really excited about a solution-oriented search and this migration that many of us are on to try and create a personal assistant so that we can be more anticipatory, save people more time, and help them with solutions more than what our previous search capability could do. So, I think that's going to be on a maturity curve from now until the end of the -- end of time. And generative AI has helped us step change that, and I expect that that improvement will continue.Oliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- Analyst Thank you. Best regards.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Seth Sigman -- Barclays -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on operating expenses and thinking about the investments planned for this year. If I recall, there was a first half weighting in the guidance originally. I know some of that was a year-over-year dynamic. Any update on how to think about that? And more specific to the second quarter, it looks like you set up guidance very similar to how you set up Q1. I'm just curious, is there anything different about the opportunity in Q2? In other words, could there be a bigger step-up in spending or anything else that may limit the flow-through that we were able to see here? Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Seth. Happy to take the question. This is John David. So, when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, in last quarter's call, we talked about the first half of the year, we'd likely see that sales would outpace operating income. Maybe that's unlikely now with these results in the first quarter, but we did have some planned investments in the second quarter related to some technology investments. We've also got a little higher depreciation year over year. In terms of the opportunity in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, there are a couple of things I want to call out in the first quarter that likely would not repeat themselves, but I don't want to take away from the team's strong performance. The first of those is just strong seasonal events in the first -- in international that helped us, and we also lapped a LIFO charge last year at Sam's, which contributed to some of the operating income growth. Those are likely not to repeat themselves. But -- so the possibility for outperformance in 2Q may be less than what it was in the first quarter. That said, I don't want to take away the headline here, and we feel really good about how the team is operating and feel really good about what the year holds for us and the opportunity to outperform the guidance that we've given.Seth Sigman -- Barclays -- Analyst OK. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to just go back to business mix. I guess, with the continued strong growth in marketplace, I guess when I -- when you look at the performance of general merchandise and Walmart U.S., that marketplace sales would obviously skew higher toward those discretionary categories. You noted the 420 million SKUs there. So, I guess the question is, is the impact of 3P marketplace growth at all starting to cannibalize, maybe in a good way, the general merchandise comps that you provide and -- or would the performance of general merchandise be stronger if you looked at it more holistically from a total GMV standpoint?John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Let me start on this, and others may want to jump in. So, first of all, as you think about the mix of our business, we've continued to have a headwind as consumer wallets have been stretched. And for us, that's resulted in about a 100-basis-point shift away from general merchandise to other categories of our business in the first quarter. We expect that to continue or some magnitude of that for the balance of the year. But to me, the real story here around general merchandise is the progress that we're making in our marketplace. And so, while general merchandise is, you know, call it, roughly flat, there are categories like pets and beauty, where the growth in the marketplace is in excess of 30%. There are other categories like furniture, sporting goods that are in excess of 20%. And I think this shows that consumers -- customers are coming to us, thinking of us very differently than what they have in the past, and it's also an indication of how and where we're gaining share in our business. So, general merchandise, being able to offer third-party assortment, is giving our customers a lot more options than what they've had in the past.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer I think general merchandise mix was impacted by food inflation to a degree. You know, when food shot up to mid-double digits, there are a lot of customers that had their paycheck allocated in that direction. And now that food pricing has calmed down some and we've got rollbacks happening in food and you've got a deflationary situation with GM, you've got the opportunity, given the elasticity, to grow more units, which we're doing. And the fact that we're growing share feels good. So, I don't get too caught up, Kelly, on whether the sales come through stores, clubs, first party, or marketplace. We just want to have what people are looking for, and we'll manage the mix on the other end of it in a way that generates more profitability, which is what you're seeing in this quarter.Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst Hey. Thank you, guys. You mentioned that within Walmart U.S. that your share gains were led by the higher-income households, I believe. Curious how you define that. What percent of your customer base the higher-income households comprised and how you're targeting that consumer? And also curious how is that consumers' engagement with Walmart changed. Thanks.John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, this is John David. I'll start. So, we define where we stratify the income groups roughly as $50,000 and below, $50,000 to $100,000, and then $100,000 and above. And as a general rule, our customer base breaks down about a third in each group. And so, in terms of what we're doing to be more attractive to that higher-income household, I think this is the -- really, the story or the word we've been using here is convenience. We are not just a play for value anymore. We talked about the number of units that we've shipped in the last 12 months, which is on par with any e-commerce player in the world. That shows that customers are coming to us and we're a consideration where we haven't been before. And convenience matters to someone irrespective of what your paycheck is, irrespective of what your income level is, and we expect that to be durable. We don't expect that to change.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Yeah. John David, I'd just add to that, it's also been encouraging to see the improvements in fresh food. We've definitely experienced benefit from improvements in quality. The supply chain has gotten tighter. Many of you have seen the work we're doing in supply chain. But produce has been really exciting to see the progress over the last couple of years. The same sort of quality improvements are coming through in the meat department. And you can see that in the types of items and categories that we're selling in store and those in pickup and delivery. And in the delivery business where we are stronger with higher-income consumer, that's where we've seen a lot of growth. I'm really excited, Doug, what you mentioned earlier is bettergoods is being a way to sell better quality, better taste profiles, and at values that really matter. Seventy percent of the items under $5 is exciting. And that appeals to all income groups. And so, if you're trying to feed a family of four or five or six and prices in restaurants have gone up and in Walmart and it's beginning to come down, and we're really proud of the rollbacks. I think our value message is strong, and having the ability to deliver flexibly is going to work out really well for us.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer We're not trying to chase higher-income cohort sales. We just offer value. If you look at what's happened historically, people with higher incomes have shopped Walmart. They've just been selective in their -- in the categories that they buy and the items that they buy. So, if we offer them the right items at the right prices, whether that's in store, first party, or marketplace, they'll respond to that. And so, as we've been able to expand our assortment online, we can appeal to more people. And then you layer on the convenience dimension, and you get a good outcome.Paul Lejuez -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you, guys. Good luck.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a really great quarter. I'm just wondering if you can discuss trends you're seeing within general merchandise between smaller ticket, shorter replacement items versus higher ticket, longer replacement items, and if any shifts in spending within the categories reflect anything about whether the consumers are making any incremental changes in their discretionary spending. And just as a quick follow-up, just curious if there was any deviation or big change in trend throughout the quarter by month. Thank you.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Yeah. Chuck, good morning. It's John. I'll take it. I think the best way to describe the consumers, it's been remarkably consistent over the last couple of years. Mix has changed, but hasn't changed that much. We've seen growth in both brands and private brands. We have seen a wide range of price point selling in the quarter. March was a strong month given Easter was in the month. We had leap year in February. That was also -- helped make it stronger. So, the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that surprising. It was strong in February, strong again in March. Weather was favorable in March, a little bit colder. And then April was softer without Easter in it. But we walked out of the quarter into to the month of May with similar trends that we've been seeing. So, the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that different than we expected. I think you should look forward that the consumers are consistent. Our inventory is in good shape. Our merchants, we said this a few minutes ago, they have the ability to mix out. They're managing their price gaps and value. They're managing additional margins. Their markdowns have been lower due to stronger inventory management. A little bit of improvement this year in shrinkage from private from the previous years. We've been going up for the last three years, and it's good to see that starting to come down in some places in the country. But we'll mix this out. Our merchant team, they've done this for a while. And in any situation for the consumer, we want to focus on value and be there for them, and we'll manage the mix on the backside.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Thanks, John.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So, just going back to the commentary on Walmart+, it sounds like it's growing double digits. As we look at the backdrop out there for membership and subscriptions, you're clearly seeing a more crowded landscape. So, just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the value proposition today and then further opportunities to differentiate Walmart+ going forward.John Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart US Hi, Rupesh. It's John. Pleased with the progress of Walmart+. It is an important part of what we do, and it is a great way for customers to save time and save money. By joining Walmart+, you get access to unlimited deliveries, which is great. And, you know, I talked to a lot of people all over the country that use it all the time. It's also been important for us to improve the perfect order. As we mentioned earlier, we launched Walmart+ in 2020 at a time when the supply chain was difficult, and so the continued momentum and improvements and being able to fulfill customers' orders with what they ordered when they ordered has been important. But again, it's an important part of what we do. We think it's a great solution for customers, and it's been exciting to see the progress.Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.Greg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. I'd like to pivot a bit back to the top line, and I think you said inflation was 40 bips in the quarter. If you look at your guidance for the rest of the year, do you expect it to settle at that kind of low level or even fall further?John David Rainey -- Chief Financial Officer Greg, we expect it to be relatively close to what we saw in the current quarter. You know, it's a mix across the baskets. We've seen general merchandise be more deflationary, but consumables and food are hovering slightly above, flat to up one. So, we generally expect it to be in this level.Greg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.Doug McMillon -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you all for joining the call. Again, thanks to our associates for a really strong quarter. When I think about the headlines from the quarter, what goes through my mind is, first, the e-commerce growth. I think the progress we're making on convenience for customers is a big deal, and that's happening through our store fulfillment, as well as through fulfillment centers. The marketplace is growing, and that brings along with it growth in advertising and membership. It was great to see both of those up 24%. Second headline is related to really good inventory management. And the third headline is related to pricing. I think the number of rollbacks that we have and the value that we're offering to customers and members is resonating, and those really set this quarter apart. Big picture, our thought is the same as it has been. We're going to be able to grow sales because we're positioned to serve people how they want to be served. We're going to grow profit faster than sales because of business mix. And we're going to be able to grow returns as we make the right capital investments. So, we'll be really consistent as it relates to that through the year, and we appreciate your time and attention.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Steph Wissink -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsDoug McMillon -- Chief Executive OfficerJohn David Rainey -- Chief Financial OfficerKate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystJohn Furner -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart USSimeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystRobby Ohmes -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystMichael Lasser -- UBS -- AnalystKath McLay -- Chief Executive Officer, Walmart InternationalChris Nicholas -- Chief Executive Officer, Sam's ClubKrisztina Katai -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOliver Chen -- TD Cowen Research -- AnalystSeth Sigman -- Barclays -- AnalystKelly Bania -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystPaul Lejuez -- Citi -- AnalystChuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- AnalystRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGreg Melich -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n",

      "Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.35%)Q3 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 4:30 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to Cisco's third-quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, head of investor relations. Sir, you may begin.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third-quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's head of investor relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. And given our recently closed acquisition of Splunk, we are also joined by Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk, which is now a Cisco company. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise.All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sami, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3, with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions, now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth, powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned 2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of 8.5 billion in value returned year to date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18th, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over 4 billion in annualized recurring revenue, and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations, using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first of its kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments. But now, I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track, as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning, we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4% and, excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year on year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. federal government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remained muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in web scale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we moved through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now, let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year over year, excluding Splunk, as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation and security, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment and software, and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access, continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers, and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on a rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our chief customer and partner officer, is departing Cisco, and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of go-to-market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence. And in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role, and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it, and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem, and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was 12.7 billion, down 13% year over year. Splunk contributed 413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post close. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing the Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of one penny $0.01 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was 9 billion, down 19%, and service revenue was 3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our zero trust offering. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. And observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes network services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at 29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was 25 billion, up 5%, and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to 6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at 4.5 billion with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4%, and software subscription revenue was up 6%. Ninety-one percent of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was 38.8 billion, up 21%, due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was 20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was 35.3 billion, up 10%, with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year over year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations, and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year over year. The Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, public sector was up 6%, and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year over year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was 4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of 27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk. And in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned 2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year to date, we've returned 8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 13.4 billion to 13.6 billion.We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes 950 million to 1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 53.6 million to 53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top-line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine, and expect to invest in opex in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margins to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal '26 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue? Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore, you may go ahead.Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yes. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion sort of being done and order growth getting back to flat and growing in some of the verticals. Some of your tech -- some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro-environment that's resulting in some positive spending. So, I'd love to understand kind of away from the inventory digestion that this seems like it's happening. What are you seeing from a macro environment, and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks? And then if I could just follow up on a different side, the 1 billion of AI orders that you have -- you know that you see -- that you believe you can get in fiscal '25, can you just talk about is this other wins more coming from the Silicon One side or optical or on the switching solution? Just any clue on kind of where do you expect to get these wins would be helpful. Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Amit. Appreciate the questions. So, from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually slow -- showed slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So, the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. So, we -- and look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. But we saw the Americas, excluding Splunk, was up 2%, so that was a positive sign. And Europe was flat. So, that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching, both positive. And by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth, so customers are investing in these private data centers, and collaboration being positive, security being high single digits on the order side. But we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the web scale infrastructure. As I said, we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet fabric, and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these web scale players. So, it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So, that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to see if you can give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000 customer opportunity for Splunk. Just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollars perspective if you're able to penetrate it. And my follow-up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this 1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. So, I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's explicitly in the back end that there's not some extrapolation to front-end data center applications. So, explicitly back end, and I think, Chuck, you were saying that it is mostly switching in the back end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions. Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind, since I just went on that one. It's $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to in next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some stand-alone Silicon One, but mostly systems, and then Optics as well. And then there's -- we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- Cisco has super strong relationships, and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers, and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And, Gary, do you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. So, we're excited about the fact that, basically, we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. And the goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or SPIFF in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. And that's really -- that's one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. And then second to that, obviously, there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have hired more strategic relationships where they can extend our footprint and insist in helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base. And we're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. So, we feel like we're off to a very good start, and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Simon. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.Tal Liani -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, guys. I'm going to ask my two questions also together. They're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products, and you have Splunk introduction to the channel. And you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing? Meaning, how long -- security grew again only 3% ex Splunk. How long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas? Or in general, is it something we're going to see early in '25 or later in '25 or '26? If you can give just a sense of timing of all these initiatives. The second part is related to it. If I remove Splunk from the numbers and you give us enough data to completely remove Splunk from '24 and I can take consensus for '25, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for '25 is about 5% because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So, Cisco, ex backlog contribution, should grow 5%. It's higher than before. So, the question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take? And what is the main component of this growth? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tal, thanks for the question. So, let's go with the first question. And I'll say on the organic Cisco security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%. But as I said, our demand was the highest it's been in probably a couple of years, and it was high single digits. So, we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new. Customers are testing, they're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So, you take the orders. And like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable, so that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So, that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit, and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So, I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front, even before Splunk, that we had brought in a new team. We've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job, and I had always said that in the second half of '24, I expect that you would see an improvement. And then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. Do you want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk You bet. So, one of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. So, last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solutions. So, bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. And this is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly but also Splunk. And as we've described earlier, our integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball three yards at a time, and we're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business. And we feel like we're on a really good track to do that.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So, I would be thinking more back half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about -- we'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because this is the last -- this is -- '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of the supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventory shipments and everything. So, '26 over '25 will be the year where we'll really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples, year-over-year comparisons. And while we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an analyst day in June, and we'll go into more detail there. And, Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer No. I think you said it right. Tal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work-off, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind, too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember, we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid to upper teens Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so, in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again, a tough compare in Q1 of '25.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Tal. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. David Vogt with UBS, you may go ahead, sir.David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So, maybe, Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. Now, I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in '24, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause core Cisco to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? And so, basically, all of the low single to mid-single-digit growth comes from Splunk. And then from a gross margin perspective, obviously, Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business. Can you maybe walk through -- you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective given the stronger margin profile of Splunk being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year? Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, David. If you remember, Q1 of this current fiscal year, fiscal '24, was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it, excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog, where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So, when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly, Splunk is a positive on that, obviously, adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24, having a nonrepeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember, first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So, if you net that out, that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid single digits in fiscal '25. And we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer term. So, I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5 to 67.5 range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, David. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on-premise or invest in kind of Cisco security products for preparedness or just impact to budgets. And then maybe second question for Scott. Just as we think about kind of the opex investment that you guys noted for Splunk, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive one year post close? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations -- I think the web scaler is pretty well understood, so I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today. And we actually had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs. I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our global customer advisory board last week in Canada. And I think we had about 60 customers there, and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So, I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side. Sorry. Did you want to add something, Gary?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk No.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead, Scott.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer And in terms of the way to think about the opex comment that I made, we talked, Meta, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this. But we will spend fiscal '25 -- from this point, through fiscal '25 ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right. We have to do channel enablement. We have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration. And this fiscal '25 is the year we'll do that. We said in the first year post acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will. That we'll be accretive in gross margin from Splunk, and we will. And that we'll be accretive in earnings per share in the second year, so think of that as fiscal '26. I know this closed a little bit early, and I think there's this perception that it closed six months early, so those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. So, round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. So, I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal '26 but still being cash flow and gross margin accretive in fiscal '25 as we invest in the integration.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler, you may go ahead.James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hi, guys. I did want to double-click on Meta's question here because this is serious ramp on the opex side to get really earnings going down again in '25, if my math is right, somewhere around 3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go be that much? Should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal '25 with that initial kind of low to mid-single-digit growth rate? Or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so, to really get? And not to layer on the question here, but is some of the opex ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp? Because historically, Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Jim. On the opex ramp, I know we haven't -- the Splunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their opex was headed and layer that into the opex that we had. There is some growth year on year. There's some investment. It's not a substantial ramp-up, though, in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies. They're likely to come more in the second half of the year. But this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. What you said, I think, is spot-on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles, as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk, as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco, and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So, yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year.Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. And I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are six to nine months, and so you're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening. And we're also just seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization where our sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrated accounts. I think you'll start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in. You're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Jim. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir.Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well, if I may. I know you're talking about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers being higher than what you're shipping to, and that implies you'll take a step-up in terms of revenue when that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious on sort of the order trends. You had mentioned you'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal '25. But how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders are starting to sort of compress? And for the second one, just a quick follow-up on the AI order, the 1 billion sort of target here. Just trying to understand if you feel like you need one or two more big wins in terms of customers or land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that 1 million target that you have? Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott, do you want to take the sequential one?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I will. On the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik. And one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this, is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates, is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter, which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter, and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So, think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And then on the AI, the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. This is not like -- we didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. They're deals behind the billion, and they're actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it -- when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So, a lot of that is going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So, this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. These are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Samik. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir.Matt Niknam -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks so much. One question, one small follow-up, and I think this has been the theme of the call. On the main question, actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under one turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that that naturally lends itself to. So, I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here. And then just on the follow-up, as we think about low to mid-singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that that creates in fiscal 1Q of next year, just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested? Or is there any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take the first one?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yeah, we moved, obviously, with the acquisition of Splunk. And this data is out there. We raised about 13.5 billion of term debt that's out there. And we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet but also with commercial paper, with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates, so it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net debt position for the first time certainly in my career and probably the first time here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco. The use of cash, though, we talked about Splunk being cash flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size. It will be. And so, our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's to support growth. Right behind that, if that's 1, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend, and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks, that's been at a steady 1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And, Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect, starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize, obviously, with the caveat that there's a lot of hotspots around the world. There are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So, we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. George Notter with Jefferies, you may go ahead, sir.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, there. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now? Thanks.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship into the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So, we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher costs that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints, and we've lapped those. So, there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out, a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal, what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, George. Next question.OperatorThank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer, you may go ahead, sir.Ittai Kidron -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thanks. I had a question for Gary. I guess, off the press, Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIEM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. So, it seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business, and why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody is trying to fight for footprint?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about, and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier, is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIEM market. So, we have a very strong established market position, and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple of years. We continue to deliver very interesting innovative capability that we think is very high value. So, for example, last week at RSA, we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment and then understand the risks associated with those things. Coupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. So, we feel like while yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. And we've also taken a very different approach than our competitors, and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly all the way through observability. And it's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking the position that we have and driving value. With respect to pricing, we don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day. and the capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. So, we're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Ittai. Next question.OperatorThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research, you may go ahead, sir.Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Thanks for the question. In the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, if we take, I would say, 1 billion to 2 billion of the hit from inventory in 2025, and from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right that you underwrite that the real industry growth is about -- the real networking growth is in that mid-single-digit range that was mentioned in a prior question. And then if that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your analyst day, we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single-digit growth business for Cisco overall? I mean, you're mixing toward Splunk and software and therefore, the math would therefore -- have you guys, on a normalized basis, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single digits in 2026, if that's true. Be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully, you were able to follow that. Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just kidding. You're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco, net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So, I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more. I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our investor day in June in Vegas. So, hopefully, I'll see you there.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Ben. Next question.OperatorThank you. Atif Malik with Citi, you may go ahead, sir.Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last year and a half with natural language assistant, SPL, and also event detection and response. Can you, big picture, talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk You bet. And so, if you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017, and we've had a quarter of a billion -- excuse me, quarter of a million users on that. So, there's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought genAI into the picture, delivering an SPL assistant, SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflow. So, think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. So, we've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live. And the benefit that we're getting, bringing it into Cisco is, Cisco has independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. So, where we benefit from Cisco is the broad, rich data sets that exist across networking. So, think lateral movement, how can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view. And frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think, are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. So, we just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Atif. Michelle, can we move to the last question?OperatorThank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have two as well. First, I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You commented that fiscal '25 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I think it's about $1 billion of opex investment. So, I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those opex investments will lie. And then secondly, last quarter, you characterized the fiscal '24 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal '25? Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Michael, thanks for the question. The year on year -- again, I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are on the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There's some one-time benefits that we had this year in our opex for the core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, frankly, in our variable comp plans, which has been a tough year, and we've come up short of our plan. And so, there's some savings in variable comp for this year in fiscal '24 that, obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. Obviously, we'll do a merit increase as well. So, there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number with the quick math that you just did. So, that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now, if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say it -- what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel, with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back, consumption of all of the inventory that we ship to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we'll work our way through that headwind, mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter, that's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about being more second half of fiscal '25, but for the full year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it's going to do, right? We've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk, and those products are getting good traction. So, that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So, I think all in all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looks like, and we'll give you a better feel for what the longer term looks like at our investor day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Michael. I now want to hand over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sami. And thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. Feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective, as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security, in general, we believe will continue to improve. And obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration, and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. I also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also that we're very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here. And thank you, all, for being with us today.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2024 investor day as part of Cisco Live on June 4th, 2024.

      "Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.35%)Q3 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 4:30 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to Cisco's third-quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, head of investor relations. Sir, you may begin.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third-quarter fiscal year '24 conference call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's head of investor relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. And given our recently closed acquisition of Splunk, we are also joined by Gary Steele, the former CEO of Splunk, which is now a Cisco company. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise.All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sami, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3, with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance. We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions, now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth, powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration, and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned 2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of 8.5 billion in value returned year to date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18th, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over 4 billion in annualized recurring revenue, and adds to our position as one of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations, using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first of its kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments. But now, I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track, as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning, we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4% and, excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year on year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. federal government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remained muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in web scale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we moved through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now, let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year over year, excluding Splunk, as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation and security, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment and software, and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access, continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers, and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on a rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with three of the top four hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our chief customer and partner officer, is departing Cisco, and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of go-to-market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence. And in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role, and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending toward normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it, and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all three. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem, and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was 12.7 billion, down 13% year over year. Splunk contributed 413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post close. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing the Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of one penny $0.01 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was 9 billion, down 19%, and service revenue was 3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, security grew 3%, driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our zero trust offering. Collaboration was flat, driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. And observability was up 27%, driven by growth in ThousandEyes network services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at 29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was 25 billion, up 5%, and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to 6.9 billion, which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at 4.5 billion with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4%, and software subscription revenue was up 6%. Ninety-one percent of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was 38.8 billion, up 21%, due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was 20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was 35.3 billion, up 10%, with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year over year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations, and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year over year. The Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, public sector was up 6%, and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year over year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was 4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of 18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of 27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk. And in line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned 2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including 1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and 1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year to date, we've returned 8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 13.4 billion to 13.6 billion.We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes 950 million to 1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of 53.6 million to 53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top-line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine, and expect to invest in opex in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margins to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal '26 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Scott. Before we start the Q&A portion of the call, I would like to remind analysts to ask one question and a single follow-up question. Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue? Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. Amit Daryanani with Evercore, you may go ahead.Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yes. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion sort of being done and order growth getting back to flat and growing in some of the verticals. Some of your tech -- some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro-environment that's resulting in some positive spending. So, I'd love to understand kind of away from the inventory digestion that this seems like it's happening. What are you seeing from a macro environment, and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks? And then if I could just follow up on a different side, the 1 billion of AI orders that you have -- you know that you see -- that you believe you can get in fiscal '25, can you just talk about is this other wins more coming from the Silicon One side or optical or on the switching solution? Just any clue on kind of where do you expect to get these wins would be helpful. Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Amit. Appreciate the questions. So, from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually slow -- showed slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So, the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. So, we -- and look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter, so that's positive. But we saw the Americas, excluding Splunk, was up 2%, so that was a positive sign. And Europe was flat. So, that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching, both positive. And by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth, so customers are investing in these private data centers, and collaboration being positive, security being high single digits on the order side. But we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the web scale infrastructure. As I said, we've got three out of four that are running our AI Ethernet fabric, and we also had two or three more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these web scale players. So, it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So, that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may go ahead, sir.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to see if you can give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000 customer opportunity for Splunk. Just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollars perspective if you're able to penetrate it. And my follow-up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this 1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. So, I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's explicitly in the back end that there's not some extrapolation to front-end data center applications. So, explicitly back end, and I think, Chuck, you were saying that it is mostly switching in the back end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions. Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind, since I just went on that one. It's $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to in next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly three times that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some stand-alone Silicon One, but mostly systems, and then Optics as well. And then there's -- we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- Cisco has super strong relationships, and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers, and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And, Gary, do you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. So, we're excited about the fact that, basically, we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. And the goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or SPIFF in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. And that's really -- that's one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. And then second to that, obviously, there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have hired more strategic relationships where they can extend our footprint and insist in helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base. And we're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. So, we feel like we're off to a very good start, and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Simon. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America. You may go ahead, sir.Tal Liani -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, guys. I'm going to ask my two questions also together. They're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products, and you have Splunk introduction to the channel. And you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing? Meaning, how long -- security grew again only 3% ex Splunk. How long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas? Or in general, is it something we're going to see early in '25 or later in '25 or '26? If you can give just a sense of timing of all these initiatives. The second part is related to it. If I remove Splunk from the numbers and you give us enough data to completely remove Splunk from '24 and I can take consensus for '25, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for '25 is about 5% because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So, Cisco, ex backlog contribution, should grow 5%. It's higher than before. So, the question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take? And what is the main component of this growth? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tal, thanks for the question. So, let's go with the first question. And I'll say on the organic Cisco security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%. But as I said, our demand was the highest it's been in probably a couple of years, and it was high single digits. So, we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new. Customers are testing, they're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So, you take the orders. And like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable, so that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So, that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit, and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So, I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front, even before Splunk, that we had brought in a new team. We've been building new innovation. The team has built five new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job, and I had always said that in the second half of '24, I expect that you would see an improvement. And then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. Do you want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk You bet. So, one of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. So, last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solutions. So, bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. And this is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly but also Splunk. And as we've described earlier, our integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball three yards at a time, and we're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business. And we feel like we're on a really good track to do that.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So, I would be thinking more back half, but we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a little more about -- we'll know more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because this is the last -- this is -- '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of the supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventory shipments and everything. So, '26 over '25 will be the year where we'll really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples, year-over-year comparisons. And while we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an analyst day in June, and we'll go into more detail there. And, Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer No. I think you said it right. Tal, the fact that you've recognized the backlog work-off, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind, too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember, we had those three consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid to upper teens Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so, in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter, and again, a tough compare in Q1 of '25.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Tal. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. David Vogt with UBS, you may go ahead, sir.David Vogt -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So, maybe, Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. Now, I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in '24, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause core Cisco to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? And so, basically, all of the low single to mid-single-digit growth comes from Splunk. And then from a gross margin perspective, obviously, Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business. Can you maybe walk through -- you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective given the stronger margin profile of Splunk being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year? Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, David. If you remember, Q1 of this current fiscal year, fiscal '24, was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it, excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog, where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So, when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly, Splunk is a positive on that, obviously, adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24, having a nonrepeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember, first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So, if you net that out, that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid single digits in fiscal '25. And we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer term. So, I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5 to 67.5 range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, David. Operator, can we move to the next question?OperatorThank you. Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead.Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on-premise or invest in kind of Cisco security products for preparedness or just impact to budgets. And then maybe second question for Scott. Just as we think about kind of the opex investment that you guys noted for Splunk, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive one year post close? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations -- I think the web scaler is pretty well understood, so I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today. And we actually had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs. I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our global customer advisory board last week in Canada. And I think we had about 60 customers there, and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So, I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side. Sorry. Did you want to add something, Gary?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk No.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead, Scott.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer And in terms of the way to think about the opex comment that I made, we talked, Meta, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this. But we will spend fiscal '25 -- from this point, through fiscal '25 ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right. We have to do channel enablement. We have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration. And this fiscal '25 is the year we'll do that. We said in the first year post acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will. That we'll be accretive in gross margin from Splunk, and we will. And that we'll be accretive in earnings per share in the second year, so think of that as fiscal '26. I know this closed a little bit early, and I think there's this perception that it closed six months early, so those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. So, round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. So, I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal '26 but still being cash flow and gross margin accretive in fiscal '25 as we invest in the integration.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Meta. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. James Fish with Piper Sandler, you may go ahead.James Fish -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hi, guys. I did want to double-click on Meta's question here because this is serious ramp on the opex side to get really earnings going down again in '25, if my math is right, somewhere around 3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go be that much? Should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal '25 with that initial kind of low to mid-single-digit growth rate? Or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so, to really get? And not to layer on the question here, but is some of the opex ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp? Because historically, Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Jim. On the opex ramp, I know we haven't -- the Splunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their opex was headed and layer that into the opex that we had. There is some growth year on year. There's some investment. It's not a substantial ramp-up, though, in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies. They're likely to come more in the second half of the year. But this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. What you said, I think, is spot-on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles, as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk, as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco, and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So, yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year.Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. And I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are six to nine months, and so you're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening. And we're also just seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization where our sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrated accounts. I think you'll start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in. You're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Jim. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan, you may go ahead, sir.Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple as well, if I may. I know you're talking about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers being higher than what you're shipping to, and that implies you'll take a step-up in terms of revenue when that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious on sort of the order trends. You had mentioned you'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal '25. But how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders are starting to sort of compress? And for the second one, just a quick follow-up on the AI order, the 1 billion sort of target here. Just trying to understand if you feel like you need one or two more big wins in terms of customers or land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that 1 million target that you have? Thank you.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott, do you want to take the sequential one?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I will. On the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik. And one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this, is where we see it moving more quickly. We talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates, is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter, which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter, and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So, think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And then on the AI, the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. This is not like -- we didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. They're deals behind the billion, and they're actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and whenever we get it -- when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So, a lot of that is going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So, this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. These are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Samik. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead, sir.Matt Niknam -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks so much. One question, one small follow-up, and I think this has been the theme of the call. On the main question, actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under one turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that that naturally lends itself to. So, I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here. And then just on the follow-up, as we think about low to mid-singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that that creates in fiscal 1Q of next year, just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested? Or is there any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective? Thanks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Do you want to take the first one?Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yeah, we moved, obviously, with the acquisition of Splunk. And this data is out there. We raised about 13.5 billion of term debt that's out there. And we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet but also with commercial paper, with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates, so it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net debt position for the first time certainly in my career and probably the first time here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last two decades here at Cisco. The use of cash, though, we talked about Splunk being cash flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size. It will be. And so, our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's to support growth. Right behind that, if that's 1, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend, and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks, that's been at a steady 1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And, Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect, starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize, obviously, with the caveat that there's a lot of hotspots around the world. There are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So, we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Matt. Operator, next question.OperatorThank you. George Notter with Jefferies, you may go ahead, sir.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, there. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now? Thanks.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship into the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So, we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher costs that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints, and we've lapped those. So, there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out, a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal, what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, George. Next question.OperatorThank you. Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer, you may go ahead, sir.Ittai Kidron -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thanks. I had a question for Gary. I guess, off the press, Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIEM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. So, it seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business, and why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody is trying to fight for footprint?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk Yeah. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about, and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier, is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIEM market. So, we have a very strong established market position, and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple of years. We continue to deliver very interesting innovative capability that we think is very high value. So, for example, last week at RSA, we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment and then understand the risks associated with those things. Coupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. So, we feel like while yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. And we've also taken a very different approach than our competitors, and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly all the way through observability. And it's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking the position that we have and driving value. With respect to pricing, we don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day. and the capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. So, we're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Ittai. Next question.OperatorThank you. Ben Reitzes with Melius Research, you may go ahead, sir.Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Thanks for the question. In the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, if we take, I would say, 1 billion to 2 billion of the hit from inventory in 2025, and from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right that you underwrite that the real industry growth is about -- the real networking growth is in that mid-single-digit range that was mentioned in a prior question. And then if that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your analyst day, we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single-digit growth business for Cisco overall? I mean, you're mixing toward Splunk and software and therefore, the math would therefore -- have you guys, on a normalized basis, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single digits in 2026, if that's true. Be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully, you were able to follow that. Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just kidding. You're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco, net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So, I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more. I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our investor day in June in Vegas. So, hopefully, I'll see you there.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Ben. Next question.OperatorThank you. Atif Malik with Citi, you may go ahead, sir.Atif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last year and a half with natural language assistant, SPL, and also event detection and response. Can you, big picture, talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities?Gary Steele -- Former Chief Executive Officer of Splunk You bet. And so, if you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017, and we've had a quarter of a billion -- excuse me, quarter of a million users on that. So, there's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought genAI into the picture, delivering an SPL assistant, SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflow. So, think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. So, we've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live. And the benefit that we're getting, bringing it into Cisco is, Cisco has independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. So, where we benefit from Cisco is the broad, rich data sets that exist across networking. So, think lateral movement, how can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view. And frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think, are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. So, we just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Atif. Michelle, can we move to the last question?OperatorThank you. Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead, sir.Mike Ng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have two as well. First, I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You commented that fiscal '25 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I think it's about $1 billion of opex investment. So, I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those opex investments will lie. And then secondly, last quarter, you characterized the fiscal '24 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal '25? Thank you.Scott Herren -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Michael, thanks for the question. The year on year -- again, I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are on the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There's some one-time benefits that we had this year in our opex for the core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, frankly, in our variable comp plans, which has been a tough year, and we've come up short of our plan. And so, there's some savings in variable comp for this year in fiscal '24 that, obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. Obviously, we'll do a merit increase as well. So, there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number with the quick math that you just did. So, that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now, if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say it -- what I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel, with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back, consumption of all of the inventory that we ship to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we'll work our way through that headwind, mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter, that's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about being more second half of fiscal '25, but for the full year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it's going to do, right? We've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk, and those products are getting good traction. So, that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So, I think all in all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looks like, and we'll give you a better feel for what the longer term looks like at our investor day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, Michael. I now want to hand over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.Chuck Robbins -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Sami. And thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. Feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective, as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security, in general, we believe will continue to improve. And obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration, and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. I also just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also that we're very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here. And thank you, all, for being with us today.Sami Badri -- Head of Investor Relations As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2024 investor day as part of Cisco Live on June 4th, 2024. Cisco's next quarterly call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year results, will be on Wednesday, August 14th, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

      "Infinera (INFN -0.94%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Infinera Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Amitabh Passi, head of investor relations. You may begin your conference.Amitabh Passi -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, operator, and good afternoon. Welcome to the call, where we'll discuss the preliminary financial results for Infinera's first quarter of fiscal 2024. A copy of the press release issued by Infinera today is available on the investor relations section of the website. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay from our website. Today's call will include financial commentary and metrics based on our preliminary first quarter of fiscal 2024 results. Yesterday, we announced that we currently expect to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 on or before May 21, 2024. As a result, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary said during the call, all financial results discussed today are preliminary, are subject to change, and are based on management's current expectations as of the date of this conference call. Final results will be included in the Form 10-Q.In addition, today's call will include projections and estimates that constitute forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to the matters referenced in the press release and current report on Form 8-K that the company issued today and our financial outlook for the second quarter of 2024. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Infinera's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023, and amended February 29, 2024; and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, as well as subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC from time to time. Please be reminded that all statements are made as of today, and Infinera undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. Today's conference call includes references to non-GAAP financial measures, except for revenue, balance sheet items, and cash flow from operations, which are discussed on a GAAP basis. Pursuant to Regulation G, we've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our preliminary earnings release, which is available on the investor relations section of our website. And finally, as a reminder, we'll allow for plenty of time for Q&A today, but we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, please. I'll now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, David Heard. David. David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Amitabh. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with the highlights for the first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Nancy to cover the financial details of the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter. The first quarter was much like a tale of two cities for us. On one hand, bookings were strong and on plan and up year over year. Strategic deal momentum was unprecedented as we won new network decisions, potentially representing over $1 billion in cumulative multiyear value across some very strategic accounts for us. Margin and EPS were within our outlook range despite the large contribution from lower-margin line systems, which are crucial for laying the groundwork for future high-margin fill. Cash flow generation was healthy, with free cash flow of 16 million in the quarter, continuing the positive trend from the fourth quarter of 2023, where we generated 58 million in free cash flow. We ended Q1 with 192 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no amount drawn against our 200 million-plus ABL. And we released our Q4 2023 and full year 2023 financial results that you've hopefully seen by now. Overall, our Q4 results came in toward the upper end of our prior outlook range. For the full year of 2023, we delivered our sixth consecutive year of revenue growth, gross margin of approximately 40%, and earnings-per-share growth of 92% compared to 2022. With respect to our quarterly close process, we plan to get back on normal cadence after we file our first quarter Form 10-Q, which is expected to occur in the next week. Despite this progress, however, our quarterly revenue came in 4% below the low end of our outlook range and declined 22% on a year-over-year basis, compared to revenue declines already reported in the industry of 30% to 50% in Q1 by many of our optical peers. Our revenue shortfall in the quarter was due to a slower release of book-ship orders to the tune of approximately $25 million, in addition to the pushout of shipments from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. We believe these market dynamics will continue through the second quarter before business conditions start to normalize in the back half of the year, enabling us to get back to year-over-year growth in the second half. The positive news I mentioned earlier is that we continued to win groundbreaking awards in the quarter with some notable customer logos that are expected to have a significant impact on the future trajectory of the company. Our open optical road map aligns well with our customers' need for open and agile architectures that deliver the lowest cost per bit, the lowest power per bit while improving operational efficiencies. Our recent wins reinforce our ability to help customers keep pace with the accelerating traffic demand, support the build-out of deep fiber networks, and efficiently manage evolving data center capacity needs, especially with new applications like artificial intelligence. As a result, we remain laser-focused on our priorities, which are to grow and take market share in the $11 billion-plus systems market, ramp our business in the growing $5 billion market for coherent pluggables, and leverage our vertical integration capabilities to break into the high volume, $2 billion intra-data center segment, driven from the optical payloads of AI. The addition of pluggables and intra-data center products onto our systems portfolio allows the maximum leverage of our U.S.-based fab as we drive significantly higher volumes through it. In fact, the annual PIC volumes associated with embedded solutions that are sold as part of our optical systems business tend to be in the tens of thousands of units. Pluggable volumes are expected to scale to hundreds of thousands of units, and we expect intra-data center volumes to scale into millions of units annually. We believe this dramatic increase in unit volume will drive a tremendous cost advantage across our portfolio in the future, a critical factor in the realization of our long-term business model. Our U.S.-based fab and advanced semiconductor packaging center also provides the added benefit of enhanced supply chain security and resiliency, which is increasingly important to our customers in the U.S. and abroad. Let me dive further into the specifics of the recent strategic wins and the progress to date in Q2, beginning first with the systems business. First, we continue the momentum with hyperscalers and our GX portfolio, including our next-generation open line systems. During the quarter, we won a new GX ICE7-based subsea deal with a major hyperscaler, potentially worth 100 million to 200 million over three years, and we secured a major design win with our GX open line system, potentially worth 200 million to 300 million over three years. In addition, we onboarded another hyperscaler with our ICE6 solution and secured a GX metro and open line system win with a Tier 2 content provider. Second, influenced by the traffic demands of hyperscalers, we continue winning managed optical fiber networks, or MOFN, deals in India, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, with at least three new customers in Q1 supporting multiple hyperscalers. These land-and-expand opportunities start out small. But with the expected growth in these regions, we expect them to become a more significant portion of our revenue in the future. As a reminder, for the full year of 2023, we estimate that our direct and indirect exposure to hyperscalers approach 50% of our product revenue. And third, we secured major wins with our GX systems portfolio with an international wholesale provider in Europe and a major service provider in the U.S. We continue to see bandwidth and connectivity needs increasing across our target markets, including increased marketing of 400-gig capacity services by carriers. We also anticipate initial orders from a design win at a major U.S. service provider customer this quarter as they continue to upgrade their metro networks while pushing to capture higher bandwidth service revenues. These orders would begin shipping in the second half of the year into 2025. Shifting to our pluggables solutions. As you are aware by now, we landed a sizable 800-gig ZR/ZR+ win with a major hyperscaler in Q1. Since we are under strict NDA, we are limited to what we can say about the specifics of this contract, but we estimate this opportunity could generate between 300 million to 700 million in revenue for us over three years, beginning in the second half of 2025. I am also excited to announce that we received our first orders for our 400-gig pluggables from a major U.S. cable MSO this quarter. While these initial orders are of relatively small size, we are excited about the potential ramp of this customer to a $300 million to $400 million opportunity over three years as we address important use cases in the customer's network across both the consumer and enterprise service offerings. Finally, turning to the latest edition of our portfolio, we launched our ICE-D intra-data center solutions ahead of the OFC show in March. These solutions, which leverage our core competency in indium phosphide PICs and our U.S.-based optical semiconductor fab in California, have the potential to reduce power per bit by as much as 75% for AI-centric applications. The elegance of our offering is that it is agnostic to data center architectures and will serve linear pluggable optics, retimed, and half-timed optics. We have test chips available now, are deeply engaged with ecosystem partners, and are working toward landing our leading customer in the second half of the year that could drive significant volume through our fab. As you can see, the momentum we have in our business sets us up well for 2025 and beyond. As evidenced by our OFC show, we are winning business, mindshare, and trust from our customers, suppliers, and partners. We also believe we remain well-positioned for the CHIPS Act funding. In fact, I'm taking this call today from Washington, D.C. As most of the CHIPS Act awards for larger companies have been announced, we expect smaller companies to begin receiving awards in the third and fourth quarter of this year. While the long-term prospects are encouraging, the short-term macro and industry dynamics are more challenging than our expectations coming into the year. We continue to expect a slow first half, with trends improving in the back half, as we focus on getting to delivering year-over-year growth in the second half. As a result, for the full year, we now expect our revenues to be down 1% to 5% compared to 2023. Nancy will walk through the details shortly. After the overall optical systems market, I expect the market to be significantly down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in an overall decline of 7% to 8% for the year. But as we head into 2025, I expect the overall market to normalize and start the next cycle of optical growth, driven by fiber to the curb, massive data center build-outs, AI, and global growth in bandwidth demand. Against this backdrop, we will focus on taking our fair share of design wins and new deals, several of which ramp from the second half of the year and into 2025; deploy what is expected to be a record number of next-generation line systems across new routes, which will drive future higher-margin transponder sales; continue our investments in R&D for systems and pluggables while increasing investments on ICE-D; drive down discretionary spending to keep overall opex flat to down 3% for the year. Given the size and scale of our recent wins, the competitiveness of our portfolio, and the strength of our long-term secular drivers underpinning our business, we believe we can return to our target growth rate of 8% to 12% in 2025, depending on where we end up for 2024. This should result in our earnings per share getting back in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 next year. As I close today, I'd like to reiterate, our recent strategic RFP wins and contracts, along with the size and scale of the -- of our opportunity funnel, give me confidence in our ultimate recovery of the business as we head into 2025 and beyond. The near-term environment is difficult, but I see no change in the long-term drivers of the business and the increasing importance of scale and vertical integration in the industry. I'd like to thank the Infinera team for their unwavering commitment to innovation that matters, execution, our customers, and to one another. I'd also like to thank our partners, customers, and shareholders for their continued support. I couldn't feel better about our strategic position, and I believe we remain well-positioned for the long term. I'll now hand the call over to Nancy to cover the financial details of the quarter and our outlook. Nancy.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by covering our first quarter results and then provide the outlook for the second quarter. As you heard from David, business trends in the first quarter were a bit of a paradox for us. On the one hand, bookings were in line with our expectations, while design win momentum was unprecedented and the strongest the company has ever seen. On the other hand, quarterly revenue of 307 million came in 4% below our outlook range and was down 22% on a year-over-year basis, compared to the 30% to 50% decline reported by many of our peers. As evident from these industry trends, it's been a tough start to the year in the industry. Our Q1 revenue decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes in the U.S., across both our major service provider and ICP customers, due to the slower release of book-ship orders and project pushouts and an overall cautious spending posture from our customers. Geographically, we derived approximately 54% of our Q1 revenue from domestic customers, a lower percentage than the trend of the past two quarters. Q1 gross margin of 36.6% was just below the midpoint of our outlook range and decreased 220 basis points year over year. Compared to the prior year, the primary driver of the lower gross margin in the quarter was the higher contribution of line systems to product mix; and secondarily, the impact of fixed costs under absorption from lower revenue and volumes. While overall company revenue declined in Q1, line system revenue was up approximately 20% compared to the year-ago quarter, setting us up well for future transponder deployments. Operating loss in the quarter was $25.9 million, with an operating margin of negative 8.4%, which was at the lower end of our outlook range and impacted by lower revenue, lower gross margin, and product mix. Operating expenses of $138 million in Q1 were flat year over year and below our outlook range of $143 million to $147 million due to continued cost discipline while we manage our investments for growth. The resulting diluted EPS was a loss of $0.17, compared to earning $0.02 in the year-ago quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. We ended the quarter with $192 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no amount drawn on our $200 million-plus ABL. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $24 million in cash flow from operations and $16 million in free cash flow, continuing the positive trend from Q4, when we generated $58 million in free cash flow. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2024 and our expectations for the rest of the year. As you have heard this afternoon, the near-term operating environment remains very challenging across the industry as our customers continue to work down excess inventory and push out some projects. We expect business dynamics we experienced in Q1 to persist into Q2. And as a result, our contemplated outlook for the second quarter is revenue of $330 million, plus or minus 20 million, implying a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 10% to 15%; gross margin of 39.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points, approximately flat on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range; operating expenses of 138 million to 141 million, modestly up on a year-over-year basis; an operating loss of 3.5%, plus or minus 300 basis points, down on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower revenue. Below the operating income line, we assume $8 million for net interest expense and $4 million for taxes. Finally, we are anticipating a loss of $0.09, plus or minus $0.04 per share, assuming a basic share count of approximately 235 million shares, and our fully diluted share count is profitable of approximately 264 million shares. We expect to utilize cash from operations in Q2, primarily for working capital, and return to generating cash from operations over the second half of the year. I expect the first quarter to mark the low point for us in the year, with a gradual improvement in our financials in Q2 and a more meaningful step-up in the back half, with revenue growth of about 8% to 10% compared to the second half of 2023. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be down between 1% and 5% compared to 2023. While it is early to be talking about 2025, our longer-term planning framework assumes that industry dynamics normalize in 2025 and that we get back to our objective of 8% to 12% revenue growth, depending on where we end 2024. This growth rate in 2025 would serve as the foundation to get us back to the $0.40 to $0.50 EPS range next year, which obviously implies roughly a year shift out in the realization of our dollar-per-share EPS objectives. Despite these near-term considerations, our refreshed portfolio, customer momentum, design wins, contracts signed, RFP activity, and the size and quality of our opportunity funnel give me a lot more confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business. I would like to thank the Infinera team as well for their continued commitment to innovation and execution excellence and our partners, customers, and shareholders for your continued cooperation and support. Operator, I'd now like to open the line for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Samik.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe for the first one, I know you talked about the strong design activity that you had in 1Q. But in terms of those translating into orders, can you give us a bit more sense about what you're seeing in terms of order trends in the quarter related to either the carriers or telco service providers versus the cloud customers? Can you give us a bit more sense there? Thank you, and I have a follow-up.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's OK. As we've mentioned in kind of past earnings calls, the ICPs tend to shop in bulk quantities. We had about 25 million of book-ship orders that normally would have come. The overall booking profile was about to what we expected in terms of dollar value and was, indeed, above one, which isn't bragging given the revenue base. But there was about 25 million, mostly ICP, that pushed out into the back half of the year, as well as we had some implementation of projects at some CSPs that also pushed into the back half of the year. We think this will continue into Q2. But based on the design wins and orders we're pulling in, we expect, you know, that pattern to reverse a bit in the back half, and it's given us more credibility and confidence in our plan for 2025. Did that answer your question?Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Yeah, no, and maybe if I can move to gross margins. Nancy, curious. I mean, you still -- you have a strong gross margin expansion here from 1Q to 2Q, and are we still sort of thinking -- if you can just walk us through that and are we still thinking sort of mid-40s exiting the year? Maybe if you can clarify that. Thank you.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, gross margin, certainly, in Q1, it was impacted by the number of line systems that we deployed. We talked a little bit about this on our last call, but you can think about that as almost a 200-basis-point impact in gross margin from line systems and then about another 100 million from just the lower volume in terms of absorption of fixed costs. As far as exiting the year, you know, if we're down 1% to 5%, I would expect that margins are likely going to be still flat to slightly up with fiscal year '23, and it'll take us a little bit of time to get back into that mid-40s, which is still our target business model.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking the question here. I -- it sounds to me, just looking at the full year guidance, that you expect your September-December results to be very similar to what you had talked about in March and previously. And I just wanted to sort of see what are the key drivers given the softness you saw this quarter. And in your guide, what sort of informing your confidence? And is my arithmetic correct in thinking that you're really expecting the same second half of the year that you anticipated before?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Amitabh.Amitabh Passi -- Head of Investor Relations Yeah. Simon, I think you're right. The second half is contemplated to be very similar to the first half -- sorry, to our prior expectations. And I think David will cover this in more detail, but we did talk about projects being pushed out from the first half to the second half. David talked about the slow release of book-ship in the order of 25 million. We also mentioned that in the last quarter's call. So, part of, I think, what you're seeing in the back half is an expectation that these projects that have been pushed out due to timing come to fruition. But, David, please go ahead and add.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think, Simon, what we are doing is just given the slower book-ship, which is, in our industry, the hardest thing to predict, we're just not expecting those pushed projects to add to what we already had in the back half. So, we're kind of tuning that into our back half plan. And so, it's both the project pushouts, the RFP wins, any line systems we're laying out, that's what we've put into our bottoms-up view for the second half.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst And for my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on customer concentration. Were there any 10% customers in the quarter? And really, more -- of more interest, I think, is what are your expectations for customer concentration for the full year 2024? What are you baking in?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So --Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Let's let Amitabh and Nancy hit that one.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, for customer concentration, there was not a 10% customer in the quarter for Q1. There were a couple that bumped up close to that. But we are still seeing a lot of strength in terms of ICPs in our top 10.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thank you very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few difficulties, so I didn't get every design win that you had. Can you just give us the total of the design wins, you know, over a three-year basis for all the ones that you kind of walked through that you anticipate, you know, starting in '25 and going through '28, what that total number was?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think maybe just to recall it, we can go through the ones for systems and for pluggables so that it's quite clear because I think it's an important point. Ron, do you want to walk through those?Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Sure. Thanks, David. We had a -- in the hyperscaler domain, we had a number of wins. One of them was on ICE7 for a subsea-based win that we see worth $100 million to $200 million over three years. We had a GX open line system for terrestrial applications that, over three years, is worth $200 million to $300 million.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Also with a major hyperscaler.Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Yeah. All of these are with the hyperscalers. A third one with hyperscalers was an ICE6 solution, as well as a GX metro. We didn't talk about a specific number on this, but this is, you know, likely in a similar range between $100 million to $200 million. We also -- and then outside the hyperscaler space, but motivated by hyperscalers, we had a number of MOFN wins, right, the managed optical fiber network. So, these are in places where the hyperscalers don't operate networks. They leverage service providers to do so, typically in the Middle East, in Africa, and in Asia. We had three new wins. These aren't massive wins, but these are what we refer to as land and expand. So, there are opportunities to get into these service providers and expand into other applications within the service providers. On the systems side in the service providers, we had a GX systems portfolio win with a wholesaler in Europe and a major service provider in the U.S. Again, over multiple years in that same time period, this would -- this will be worth $200 million to $300 million. And then if we look at the pluggable wins, this is also a hyperscaler, we had a sizable win in ZR and ZR+ for 800 gig. This is the one that David referred to as under strict NDA, so we can't say a lot about it, but it is worth anywhere between 300 million to 700 million over a three-year period. And then on the on the subsystems side, we had a 400 -- our first 400 gig, not just win, but booking with a major U.S. cable provider. And that cable provider, you know, has the potential, just in a split, you know, decision for that network to spend $300 million to $400 million over the next three years, leveraging both applications that use our subcarrier technology with our 400 gig, as well as point-to-point applications with our 400 gig. Really desirable win in the 400 gig space there.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Ron. So, those are all based on, again, those are either design wins, RFPs, or actual contracts, and again, on the forecast that we're being provided from the customer set. Did that help?Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst That's tremendous. And then my follow-up question is, you know, is there a number of other customers that you're working for? Would you expect more substantial orders on top of that to occur throughout calendar 2024?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think last time when we updated, we had talked about the 800-gig design win as an example, the initial sampling order that we got from the major U.S. MSO that Ron talked about, that happened in Q2, here. And then we also have a U.S. service provider that we had a design win, you know, almost, call it, three quarters ago, and we believe that we'll be receiving the first orders this quarter, that would then be, you know, up for scaling as we get into the back half of the year into '25. So, obviously, that's kind of why we're writing out this kind of short-term bottoming of the optical curve as people finally burn out the inventory. But, you know, ultimately, the traffic needs both in the back half and definitely into '25. This helps us fill out, you know, kind of the capacity curve to substantiate the growth for 2025.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Fantastic. Thanks for the clarity. No other questions. Thank you.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Thanks, Christian.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Mike.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Hey. Hi, Dave. How are you? Hey. You know, the second half outlook that you have. I mean, it's really strong, and it seems to be based on, like, an unprecedented number of design wins, you know, that you can list off. Like we've never heard, you know, this before. Like something new is going on here. And I want to gauge you on the -- like is this -- how much of the second half is the industry and how much is specific to you guys, I don't know, taking share and having these, you know, through these design wins.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer It's really a good question. I mean, look, the industry is tough to gauge, right? When you looked at where we were coming into the year, everybody kind of had optical growing at, you know, low single digits, 1% to 3%. When we look at who's announced so far, right, it appears that, you know, most folks that have announced have been now with us announcing between 22% and 50% year-over-year declines in Q1. You know, now, we think that'll improve for everybody based on everybody's imputed guidance in Q2. And based on what we see for the industry, there will be year-over-year growth in the back half. I mean, I hate to say it, but a really lousy compare when you're at the bottom of the curve for the front half. Now, that being said, I've been at the company six years, and I just haven't seen us in a position with our portfolio where we're able to get this kind of design wins. But don't forget, we still have to, you know, get orders for that, deliver the orders, and execute. So, what we're trying to do for everybody is give you our best view. I think we are taking more than our fair share if you look at our book-to-bill over the last, you know, two years compared to competitors. But again, getting that rolled out and seeing, you know, the recovery start in Q3 is an important aspect. A lot of the schedules for these products for the back half and especially into 2025, you know, are supported by a lot of the traffic growth, you know, that we see in between data centers and for new technology insertion.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Great. And, you know, particularly in the ICP hyperscale market, but I think also in metro, it feels like we've gained a lot of share in the last year I'd say. But have you seen the -- any numbers come out to kind of quantify whether that feeling is right and you have gained share in metro DCI?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Have not yet seen anything, you know, come out. And I think that's because the industry is still -- again, when I mentioned those decline numbers for Q1, you know, for a market that was going to grow 1% to 3%, I just think you're seeing a bottoming of a curve in the front half as people work through the final inventory and reload for 400-gig networks in the metro, the 800-gig networks and the high capacity networks for, you know, the next lift up of the pluggable -- you know, the pluggable to hit. As well as subsea, they're laying, you know, a record number of cables out across the world. So, you know, typically, you don't get analysts that then very quickly calculate overall optical looks like maybe a decline 7% or 8% this year. That's our calculation based on what we see today. I'm sure the analysts will come out with a market share, but it's usually a looking-back figure.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. This is Karan Juvekar on for Meta.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst The first question is just more of a clarification question. I think you mentioned that the 25 million of the book-ship pushouts were mostly on the ICP side.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Sure.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Did I hear that correctly? And if so --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer You did.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Was that a surprise to you, guys? I guess any detail on sort of how or [Inaudible]David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Well, yeah, no, I -- obviously, our contemplated midpoint of the range was higher than what we got. And that's not -- you know, our job as leaders of the company and executives and stewards of the shareholder is to give the best view of what we see. So, obviously, that shifting out was a bit surprising, and we continue to see that happening in Q2. Again, some, you know, of that is actual book-ship business and some are projects that are just being delayed as people try to kind of clean up things on their own financials in the front half, and then, you know, we see things being scheduled in the second half. But yeah, primarily on the ICP front. And if you look at our ICP numbers year over year, quarter over quarter, that's why you see a little bit more of a decline there. And yes, that was -- that wasn't something we had planned.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. And then second question for me, I guess traction on the pluggables win that you had last quarter, any details around there, and was this one of the pushouts that you saw in the quarter? And if so, does that impact the gross margins, just given it's a more vertically integrated product? Appreciate that you have an NDA so you may not be able to disclose much, but --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Just to be clear -- yeah, I want to be crystal clear. So, the 800-gig wouldn't start until -- as we talked about on our last call, until we're in the mid of 2025. So, that had no impact on our business in Q1 and Q2, although those -- that number that we gave is, again, based on as we engage on the contract and look at the forecasts that we've contemplated to be able to drive the right capacity through our fabs. That 300 to 700 is something we hadn't talked about prior. The new win in the -- or the design win in -- with the MSO in North America is something new here in Q2, meaning the first order we have. The ability to then scale that to the numbers Ron talked about, again, would begin to happen as we get into the back half of the year. So, that was also not contemplated. That's not an excuse code for the front half dip that both the industry is experiencing and we're experiencing.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. I just wanted to come back on the roster of content provider wins you mentioned. Just to be clear, are these all incremental to the existing run rates of business you're doing with these customers?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think, for the most part, the ICE7 subsea win is incremental. The hyperscaler OLS win for a new line system that we just announced in Q1 is, indeed, incremental on the systems side of things, and certainly the 800-gig win. So, those were the three largest that we talked about. The -- moving somebody over to ICE6 is actually, you know, an existing customer that we have that's moving on to the ICE6 platform.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. OK. And then for these wins, I assume then these are all contracted with, you know, the dollar values you guys have outlined, specified, or at least unit volumes that translate into those kinds of dollars specified, or I guess I just want to make sure that these are --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah --George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Firm pieces of business that are in backlog now. And I guess I would have expected the bookings to be up more also given the strength here. I'm just trying to put it all together and think about the second half of the year and that ramp. Thanks.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer No, George, it's a good question, and I think we were pretty specific in our language here. You know, these design wins or RFP wins, when you win them, it's great. And when you -- you know, in many cases, you sign a contract. But then the volumes are based on the forecast that they then roll out. So, what we've given you is as we've negotiated these RFPs, these design wins, and price them, as well as the pluggable contract that we talked about, we get volumes, you know, kind of low range, medium range, high range. It's actually low and high from the customers. These are not hard-programmed volume to roll out in Quarter X, Y, and Z. That would be great because it would be much easier to do the quarterly predictions going forward. So, these are -- as we said, that should be worth these ranges, right, and that's based on the forecast we've gotten from the client that we've landed those deals at.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And is that a big element of the second half ramp? I assume it is given the conversation.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's a reasonable portion of the second half ramp. Many of them on the line system, the MOFN side, and then the pushouts of the ICP from Q1 and Q2. I mean, that's material to the second half. And when you look at the pluggable, the OLS win and the ICE7 win, that's more primary to 2025.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, George.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Kang with B. Riley. Please go ahead.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is regarding the inventory situation. Just exactly how much excess inventories are out there, and are we pretty close or we still got maybe a few more quarters to go?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Well, certainly, there was enough to prevent 25 million of book-ship in the quarter. And, you know, call it, an equal number for Q2, as well as continued project pushouts. But we do think that things are beginning to thin down. And based on the RFP activity and the engagement we're having on both the ICP and the CSP side, you know, we believe things are narrowing down to where the second half -- there should be, again, that year-over-year growth, not just first half over second half growth, because this is, I think, a trough that you'll see in the industry that will begin to pick up in Q3 and Q4.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Got it. And then regarding all these multiple design wins you talked about, you know, ranging from, you know, $100 million to $300 million, are these, just for clarification, hard contracts where, you know, there's like a minimum, you know, amount or it's just forecast from these customers?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer No, these are -- I mean, look, these are all wins that then purchase orders are issued against, right? Either contracts or RFP wins or design wins where you then have quantities off against that. Now, part of that process we go through what volume over what period of time. And that's why there's such a wide range of we try to put a low and a high. And that's just to better educate folks on, you know, why we feel good about 2025 moving forward.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst And when would they start to, you know, hit your like backlog then?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I mean, as you start to get out toward the end of this year, I think you would start to see that hit the backlog. That's, you know, kind of what would be normalized in a view of the growth rates we have in for Q3 and Q4 and for 2025.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to David Heard for closing remarks.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, certainly, as we mentioned, the start to the year was slower than expected as carriers and ICPs kind of held on to their orders and ran their networks a bit hotter than I think we all expected, and you'll see that going across the industry. But they are planning on expanding those 400-gig services and 800-gig services for high-capacity routes. As I said, you know, we're not the overall market analyst, but as we calculate, that probably says that there's a market decline in the front half. That's kind of temporary in nature, call it, digestion finalization of 20%, followed by growth in the back half, albeit still we're not pushing anything -- we're not pushing everything that was missed in the front half to the second half, for an overall decline in the optical market that's 7% to 8%. But the traffic generation in 400-gig subsea high-capacity routes and then ultimately inside the data center are going to drive, I think, the optical world to go back to that normalized next cycle on AI as we get into 2025. So, certainly, these RFP wins and, you know, fair questions, guys, on the -- it's not hardcoded contract value, but, you know, in the company's history, we just have not seen this kind of potential value of lining a brand new line system into ICPs, ICE7 wins already that are significant in nature, as well as on the pluggables side, which is, I think, going to drive a huge cost benefit for us, you know, for our long-term model. So, we all know optical is becoming more important to the network outside and inside the data center. And I think our strategy for VI is well positioned for the next optical cycle. So, I know the news on, you know, the Q1, you know, and the Q2 outlook well in line with the optical industry or a little bit better is not great. The prospects on that second half growth and even more importantly into 2025 is very, very strong. So, we'll continue to keep our heads down and focusing on execution and taking more than our fair share, driving operating efficiencies, and keeping transparent with what we see in the market as it develops. So, appreciate the thoughtful questions and engagement, and we'll be talking to you soon. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Amitabh Passi -- Head of Investor RelationsDavid Heard -- Chief Executive OfficerNancy Erba -- Chief Financial OfficerSamik Chatterjee -- J.P.

Pursuant to Regulation G, we've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our preliminary earnings release, which is available on the investor relations section of our website. And finally, as a reminder, we'll allow for plenty of time for Q&A today, but we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, please. I'll now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, David Heard. David. David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Amitabh. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with the highlights for the first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Nancy to cover the financial details of the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter. The first quarter was much like a tale of two cities for us. On one hand, bookings were strong and on plan and up year over year. Strategic deal momentum was unprecedented as we won new network decisions, potentially representing over $1 billion in cumulative multiyear value across some very strategic accounts for us. Margin and EPS were within our outlook range despite the large contribution from lower-margin line systems, which are crucial for laying the groundwork for future high-margin fill. Cash flow generation was healthy, with free cash flow of 16 million in the quarter, continuing the positive trend from the fourth quarter of 2023, where we generated 58 million in free cash flow. We ended Q1 with 192 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no amount drawn against our 200 million-plus ABL. And we released our Q4 2023 and full year 2023 financial results that you've hopefully seen by now. Overall, our Q4 results came in toward the upper end of our prior outlook range. For the full year of 2023, we delivered our sixth consecutive year of revenue growth, gross margin of approximately 40%, and earnings-per-share growth of 92% compared to 2022. With respect to our quarterly close process, we plan to get back on normal cadence after we file our first quarter Form 10-Q, which is expected to occur in the next week. Despite this progress, however, our quarterly revenue came in 4% below the low end of our outlook range and declined 22% on a year-over-year basis, compared to revenue declines already reported in the industry of 30% to 50% in Q1 by many of our optical peers. Our revenue shortfall in the quarter was due to a slower release of book-ship orders to the tune of approximately $25 million, in addition to the pushout of shipments from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. We believe these market dynamics will continue through the second quarter before business conditions start to normalize in the back half of the year, enabling us to get back to year-over-year growth in the second half. The positive news I mentioned earlier is that we continued to win groundbreaking awards in the quarter with some notable customer logos that are expected to have a significant impact on the future trajectory of the company. Our open optical road map aligns well with our customers' need for open and agile architectures that deliver the lowest cost per bit, the lowest power per bit while improving operational efficiencies. Our recent wins reinforce our ability to help customers keep pace with the accelerating traffic demand, support the build-out of deep fiber networks, and efficiently manage evolving data center capacity needs, especially with new applications like artificial intelligence. As a result, we remain laser-focused on our priorities, which are to grow and take market share in the $11 billion-plus systems market, ramp our business in the growing $5 billion market for coherent pluggables, and leverage our vertical integration capabilities to break into the high volume, $2 billion intra-data center segment, driven from the optical payloads of AI. The addition of pluggables and intra-data center products onto our systems portfolio allows the maximum leverage of our U.S.-based fab as we drive significantly higher volumes through it. In fact, the annual PIC volumes associated with embedded solutions that are sold as part of our optical systems business tend to be in the tens of thousands of units. Pluggable volumes are expected to scale to hundreds of thousands of units, and we expect intra-data center volumes to scale into millions of units annually. We believe this dramatic increase in unit volume will drive a tremendous cost advantage across our portfolio in the future, a critical factor in the realization of our long-term business model. Our U.S.-based fab and advanced semiconductor packaging center also provides the added benefit of enhanced supply chain security and resiliency, which is increasingly important to our customers in the U.S. and abroad. Let me dive further into the specifics of the recent strategic wins and the progress to date in Q2, beginning first with the systems business. First, we continue the momentum with hyperscalers and our GX portfolio, including our next-generation open line systems. During the quarter, we won a new GX ICE7-based subsea deal with a major hyperscaler, potentially worth 100 million to 200 million over three years, and we secured a major design win with our GX open line system, potentially worth 200 million to 300 million over three years. In addition, we onboarded another hyperscaler with our ICE6 solution and secured a GX metro and open line system win with a Tier 2 content provider. Second, influenced by the traffic demands of hyperscalers, we continue winning managed optical fiber networks, or MOFN, deals in India, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, with at least three new customers in Q1 supporting multiple hyperscalers. These land-and-expand opportunities start out small. But with the expected growth in these regions, we expect them to become a more significant portion of our revenue in the future. As a reminder, for the full year of 2023, we estimate that our direct and indirect exposure to hyperscalers approach 50% of our product revenue. And third, we secured major wins with our GX systems portfolio with an international wholesale provider in Europe and a major service provider in the U.S. We continue to see bandwidth and connectivity needs increasing across our target markets, including increased marketing of 400-gig capacity services by carriers. We also anticipate initial orders from a design win at a major U.S. service provider customer this quarter as they continue to upgrade their metro networks while pushing to capture higher bandwidth service revenues. These orders would begin shipping in the second half of the year into 2025. Shifting to our pluggables solutions. As you are aware by now, we landed a sizable 800-gig ZR/ZR+ win with a major hyperscaler in Q1. Since we are under strict NDA, we are limited to what we can say about the specifics of this contract, but we estimate this opportunity could generate between 300 million to 700 million in revenue for us over three years, beginning in the second half of 2025. I am also excited to announce that we received our first orders for our 400-gig pluggables from a major U.S. cable MSO this quarter. While these initial orders are of relatively small size, we are excited about the potential ramp of this customer to a $300 million to $400 million opportunity over three years as we address important use cases in the customer's network across both the consumer and enterprise service offerings. Finally, turning to the latest edition of our portfolio, we launched our ICE-D intra-data center solutions ahead of the OFC show in March. These solutions, which leverage our core competency in indium phosphide PICs and our U.S.-based optical semiconductor fab in California, have the potential to reduce power per bit by as much as 75% for AI-centric applications. The elegance of our offering is that it is agnostic to data center architectures and will serve linear pluggable optics, retimed, and half-timed optics. We have test chips available now, are deeply engaged with ecosystem partners, and are working toward landing our leading customer in the second half of the year that could drive significant volume through our fab. As you can see, the momentum we have in our business sets us up well for 2025 and beyond. As evidenced by our OFC show, we are winning business, mindshare, and trust from our customers, suppliers, and partners. We also believe we remain well-positioned for the CHIPS Act funding. In fact, I'm taking this call today from Washington, D.C. As most of the CHIPS Act awards for larger companies have been announced, we expect smaller companies to begin receiving awards in the third and fourth quarter of this year. While the long-term prospects are encouraging, the short-term macro and industry dynamics are more challenging than our expectations coming into the year. We continue to expect a slow first half, with trends improving in the back half, as we focus on getting to delivering year-over-year growth in the second half. As a result, for the full year, we now expect our revenues to be down 1% to 5% compared to 2023. Nancy will walk through the details shortly. After the overall optical systems market, I expect the market to be significantly down in the first half and up in the second half of the year, resulting in an overall decline of 7% to 8% for the year. But as we head into 2025, I expect the overall market to normalize and start the next cycle of optical growth, driven by fiber to the curb, massive data center build-outs, AI, and global growth in bandwidth demand. Against this backdrop, we will focus on taking our fair share of design wins and new deals, several of which ramp from the second half of the year and into 2025; deploy what is expected to be a record number of next-generation line systems across new routes, which will drive future higher-margin transponder sales; continue our investments in R&D for systems and pluggables while increasing investments on ICE-D; drive down discretionary spending to keep overall opex flat to down 3% for the year. Given the size and scale of our recent wins, the competitiveness of our portfolio, and the strength of our long-term secular drivers underpinning our business, we believe we can return to our target growth rate of 8% to 12% in 2025, depending on where we end up for 2024. This should result in our earnings per share getting back in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 next year. As I close today, I'd like to reiterate, our recent strategic RFP wins and contracts, along with the size and scale of the -- of our opportunity funnel, give me confidence in our ultimate recovery of the business as we head into 2025 and beyond. The near-term environment is difficult, but I see no change in the long-term drivers of the business and the increasing importance of scale and vertical integration in the industry. I'd like to thank the Infinera team for their unwavering commitment to innovation that matters, execution, our customers, and to one another. I'd also like to thank our partners, customers, and shareholders for their continued support. I couldn't feel better about our strategic position, and I believe we remain well-positioned for the long term. I'll now hand the call over to Nancy to cover the financial details of the quarter and our outlook. Nancy.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by covering our first quarter results and then provide the outlook for the second quarter. As you heard from David, business trends in the first quarter were a bit of a paradox for us. On the one hand, bookings were in line with our expectations, while design win momentum was unprecedented and the strongest the company has ever seen. On the other hand, quarterly revenue of 307 million came in 4% below our outlook range and was down 22% on a year-over-year basis, compared to the 30% to 50% decline reported by many of our peers. As evident from these industry trends, it's been a tough start to the year in the industry. Our Q1 revenue decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes in the U.S., across both our major service provider and ICP customers, due to the slower release of book-ship orders and project pushouts and an overall cautious spending posture from our customers. Geographically, we derived approximately 54% of our Q1 revenue from domestic customers, a lower percentage than the trend of the past two quarters. Q1 gross margin of 36.6% was just below the midpoint of our outlook range and decreased 220 basis points year over year. Compared to the prior year, the primary driver of the lower gross margin in the quarter was the higher contribution of line systems to product mix; and secondarily, the impact of fixed costs under absorption from lower revenue and volumes. While overall company revenue declined in Q1, line system revenue was up approximately 20% compared to the year-ago quarter, setting us up well for future transponder deployments. Operating loss in the quarter was $25.9 million, with an operating margin of negative 8.4%, which was at the lower end of our outlook range and impacted by lower revenue, lower gross margin, and product mix. Operating expenses of $138 million in Q1 were flat year over year and below our outlook range of $143 million to $147 million due to continued cost discipline while we manage our investments for growth. The resulting diluted EPS was a loss of $0.17, compared to earning $0.02 in the year-ago quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. We ended the quarter with $192 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no amount drawn on our $200 million-plus ABL. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $24 million in cash flow from operations and $16 million in free cash flow, continuing the positive trend from Q4, when we generated $58 million in free cash flow. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2024 and our expectations for the rest of the year. As you have heard this afternoon, the near-term operating environment remains very challenging across the industry as our customers continue to work down excess inventory and push out some projects. We expect business dynamics we experienced in Q1 to persist into Q2. And as a result, our contemplated outlook for the second quarter is revenue of $330 million, plus or minus 20 million, implying a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 10% to 15%; gross margin of 39.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points, approximately flat on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range; operating expenses of 138 million to 141 million, modestly up on a year-over-year basis; an operating loss of 3.5%, plus or minus 300 basis points, down on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower revenue. Below the operating income line, we assume $8 million for net interest expense and $4 million for taxes. Finally, we are anticipating a loss of $0.09, plus or minus $0.04 per share, assuming a basic share count of approximately 235 million shares, and our fully diluted share count is profitable of approximately 264 million shares. We expect to utilize cash from operations in Q2, primarily for working capital, and return to generating cash from operations over the second half of the year. I expect the first quarter to mark the low point for us in the year, with a gradual improvement in our financials in Q2 and a more meaningful step-up in the back half, with revenue growth of about 8% to 10% compared to the second half of 2023. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be down between 1% and 5% compared to 2023. While it is early to be talking about 2025, our longer-term planning framework assumes that industry dynamics normalize in 2025 and that we get back to our objective of 8% to 12% revenue growth, depending on where we end 2024. This growth rate in 2025 would serve as the foundation to get us back to the $0.40 to $0.50 EPS range next year, which obviously implies roughly a year shift out in the realization of our dollar-per-share EPS objectives. Despite these near-term considerations, our refreshed portfolio, customer momentum, design wins, contracts signed, RFP activity, and the size and quality of our opportunity funnel give me a lot more confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business. I would like to thank the Infinera team as well for their continued commitment to innovation and execution excellence and our partners, customers, and shareholders for your continued cooperation and support. Operator, I'd now like to open the line for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Samik.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe for the first one, I know you talked about the strong design activity that you had in 1Q. But in terms of those translating into orders, can you give us a bit more sense about what you're seeing in terms of order trends in the quarter related to either the carriers or telco service providers versus the cloud customers? Can you give us a bit more sense there? Thank you, and I have a follow-up.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's OK. As we've mentioned in kind of past earnings calls, the ICPs tend to shop in bulk quantities. We had about 25 million of book-ship orders that normally would have come. The overall booking profile was about to what we expected in terms of dollar value and was, indeed, above one, which isn't bragging given the revenue base. But there was about 25 million, mostly ICP, that pushed out into the back half of the year, as well as we had some implementation of projects at some CSPs that also pushed into the back half of the year. We think this will continue into Q2. But based on the design wins and orders we're pulling in, we expect, you know, that pattern to reverse a bit in the back half, and it's given us more credibility and confidence in our plan for 2025. Did that answer your question?Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Yeah, no, and maybe if I can move to gross margins. Nancy, curious. I mean, you still -- you have a strong gross margin expansion here from 1Q to 2Q, and are we still sort of thinking -- if you can just walk us through that and are we still thinking sort of mid-40s exiting the year? Maybe if you can clarify that. Thank you.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, gross margin, certainly, in Q1, it was impacted by the number of line systems that we deployed. We talked a little bit about this on our last call, but you can think about that as almost a 200-basis-point impact in gross margin from line systems and then about another 100 million from just the lower volume in terms of absorption of fixed costs. As far as exiting the year, you know, if we're down 1% to 5%, I would expect that margins are likely going to be still flat to slightly up with fiscal year '23, and it'll take us a little bit of time to get back into that mid-40s, which is still our target business model.Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking the question here. I -- it sounds to me, just looking at the full year guidance, that you expect your September-December results to be very similar to what you had talked about in March and previously. And I just wanted to sort of see what are the key drivers given the softness you saw this quarter. And in your guide, what sort of informing your confidence? And is my arithmetic correct in thinking that you're really expecting the same second half of the year that you anticipated before?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Amitabh.Amitabh Passi -- Head of Investor Relations Yeah. Simon, I think you're right. The second half is contemplated to be very similar to the first half -- sorry, to our prior expectations. And I think David will cover this in more detail, but we did talk about projects being pushed out from the first half to the second half. David talked about the slow release of book-ship in the order of 25 million. We also mentioned that in the last quarter's call. So, part of, I think, what you're seeing in the back half is an expectation that these projects that have been pushed out due to timing come to fruition. But, David, please go ahead and add.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think, Simon, what we are doing is just given the slower book-ship, which is, in our industry, the hardest thing to predict, we're just not expecting those pushed projects to add to what we already had in the back half. So, we're kind of tuning that into our back half plan. And so, it's both the project pushouts, the RFP wins, any line systems we're laying out, that's what we've put into our bottoms-up view for the second half.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst And for my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on customer concentration. Were there any 10% customers in the quarter? And really, more -- of more interest, I think, is what are your expectations for customer concentration for the full year 2024? What are you baking in?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So --Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Let's let Amitabh and Nancy hit that one.Nancy Erba -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, for customer concentration, there was not a 10% customer in the quarter for Q1. There were a couple that bumped up close to that. But we are still seeing a lot of strength in terms of ICPs in our top 10.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thank you very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few difficulties, so I didn't get every design win that you had. Can you just give us the total of the design wins, you know, over a three-year basis for all the ones that you kind of walked through that you anticipate, you know, starting in '25 and going through '28, what that total number was?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think maybe just to recall it, we can go through the ones for systems and for pluggables so that it's quite clear because I think it's an important point. Ron, do you want to walk through those?Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Sure. Thanks, David. We had a -- in the hyperscaler domain, we had a number of wins. One of them was on ICE7 for a subsea-based win that we see worth $100 million to $200 million over three years. We had a GX open line system for terrestrial applications that, over three years, is worth $200 million to $300 million.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Also with a major hyperscaler.Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Yeah. All of these are with the hyperscalers. A third one with hyperscalers was an ICE6 solution, as well as a GX metro. We didn't talk about a specific number on this, but this is, you know, likely in a similar range between $100 million to $200 million. We also -- and then outside the hyperscaler space, but motivated by hyperscalers, we had a number of MOFN wins, right, the managed optical fiber network. So, these are in places where the hyperscalers don't operate networks. They leverage service providers to do so, typically in the Middle East, in Africa, and in Asia. We had three new wins. These aren't massive wins, but these are what we refer to as land and expand. So, there are opportunities to get into these service providers and expand into other applications within the service providers. On the systems side in the service providers, we had a GX systems portfolio win with a wholesaler in Europe and a major service provider in the U.S. Again, over multiple years in that same time period, this would -- this will be worth $200 million to $300 million. And then if we look at the pluggable wins, this is also a hyperscaler, we had a sizable win in ZR and ZR+ for 800 gig. This is the one that David referred to as under strict NDA, so we can't say a lot about it, but it is worth anywhere between 300 million to 700 million over a three-year period. And then on the on the subsystems side, we had a 400 -- our first 400 gig, not just win, but booking with a major U.S. cable provider. And that cable provider, you know, has the potential, just in a split, you know, decision for that network to spend $300 million to $400 million over the next three years, leveraging both applications that use our subcarrier technology with our 400 gig, as well as point-to-point applications with our 400 gig. Really desirable win in the 400 gig space there.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Ron. So, those are all based on, again, those are either design wins, RFPs, or actual contracts, and again, on the forecast that we're being provided from the customer set. Did that help?Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst That's tremendous. And then my follow-up question is, you know, is there a number of other customers that you're working for? Would you expect more substantial orders on top of that to occur throughout calendar 2024?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think last time when we updated, we had talked about the 800-gig design win as an example, the initial sampling order that we got from the major U.S. MSO that Ron talked about, that happened in Q2, here. And then we also have a U.S. service provider that we had a design win, you know, almost, call it, three quarters ago, and we believe that we'll be receiving the first orders this quarter, that would then be, you know, up for scaling as we get into the back half of the year into '25. So, obviously, that's kind of why we're writing out this kind of short-term bottoming of the optical curve as people finally burn out the inventory. But, you know, ultimately, the traffic needs both in the back half and definitely into '25. This helps us fill out, you know, kind of the capacity curve to substantiate the growth for 2025.Christian Schwab -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Fantastic. Thanks for the clarity. No other questions. Thank you.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.Ron Johnson -- Senior Vice President and General Manager,Optical Subsystems and Global Engineering Thanks, Christian.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Mike.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Hey. Hi, Dave. How are you? Hey. You know, the second half outlook that you have. I mean, it's really strong, and it seems to be based on, like, an unprecedented number of design wins, you know, that you can list off. Like we've never heard, you know, this before. Like something new is going on here. And I want to gauge you on the -- like is this -- how much of the second half is the industry and how much is specific to you guys, I don't know, taking share and having these, you know, through these design wins.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer It's really a good question. I mean, look, the industry is tough to gauge, right? When you looked at where we were coming into the year, everybody kind of had optical growing at, you know, low single digits, 1% to 3%. When we look at who's announced so far, right, it appears that, you know, most folks that have announced have been now with us announcing between 22% and 50% year-over-year declines in Q1. You know, now, we think that'll improve for everybody based on everybody's imputed guidance in Q2. And based on what we see for the industry, there will be year-over-year growth in the back half. I mean, I hate to say it, but a really lousy compare when you're at the bottom of the curve for the front half. Now, that being said, I've been at the company six years, and I just haven't seen us in a position with our portfolio where we're able to get this kind of design wins. But don't forget, we still have to, you know, get orders for that, deliver the orders, and execute. So, what we're trying to do for everybody is give you our best view. I think we are taking more than our fair share if you look at our book-to-bill over the last, you know, two years compared to competitors. But again, getting that rolled out and seeing, you know, the recovery start in Q3 is an important aspect. A lot of the schedules for these products for the back half and especially into 2025, you know, are supported by a lot of the traffic growth, you know, that we see in between data centers and for new technology insertion.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Great. And, you know, particularly in the ICP hyperscale market, but I think also in metro, it feels like we've gained a lot of share in the last year I'd say. But have you seen the -- any numbers come out to kind of quantify whether that feeling is right and you have gained share in metro DCI?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Have not yet seen anything, you know, come out. And I think that's because the industry is still -- again, when I mentioned those decline numbers for Q1, you know, for a market that was going to grow 1% to 3%, I just think you're seeing a bottoming of a curve in the front half as people work through the final inventory and reload for 400-gig networks in the metro, the 800-gig networks and the high capacity networks for, you know, the next lift up of the pluggable -- you know, the pluggable to hit. As well as subsea, they're laying, you know, a record number of cables out across the world. So, you know, typically, you don't get analysts that then very quickly calculate overall optical looks like maybe a decline 7% or 8% this year. That's our calculation based on what we see today. I'm sure the analysts will come out with a market share, but it's usually a looking-back figure.Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks very much.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. This is Karan Juvekar on for Meta.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Hey.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst The first question is just more of a clarification question. I think you mentioned that the 25 million of the book-ship pushouts were mostly on the ICP side.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Sure.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Did I hear that correctly? And if so --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer You did.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Was that a surprise to you, guys? I guess any detail on sort of how or [Inaudible]David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Well, yeah, no, I -- obviously, our contemplated midpoint of the range was higher than what we got. And that's not -- you know, our job as leaders of the company and executives and stewards of the shareholder is to give the best view of what we see. So, obviously, that shifting out was a bit surprising, and we continue to see that happening in Q2. Again, some, you know, of that is actual book-ship business and some are projects that are just being delayed as people try to kind of clean up things on their own financials in the front half, and then, you know, we see things being scheduled in the second half. But yeah, primarily on the ICP front. And if you look at our ICP numbers year over year, quarter over quarter, that's why you see a little bit more of a decline there. And yes, that was -- that wasn't something we had planned.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. And then second question for me, I guess traction on the pluggables win that you had last quarter, any details around there, and was this one of the pushouts that you saw in the quarter? And if so, does that impact the gross margins, just given it's a more vertically integrated product? Appreciate that you have an NDA so you may not be able to disclose much, but --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Just to be clear -- yeah, I want to be crystal clear. So, the 800-gig wouldn't start until -- as we talked about on our last call, until we're in the mid of 2025. So, that had no impact on our business in Q1 and Q2, although those -- that number that we gave is, again, based on as we engage on the contract and look at the forecasts that we've contemplated to be able to drive the right capacity through our fabs. That 300 to 700 is something we hadn't talked about prior. The new win in the -- or the design win in -- with the MSO in North America is something new here in Q2, meaning the first order we have. The ability to then scale that to the numbers Ron talked about, again, would begin to happen as we get into the back half of the year. So, that was also not contemplated. That's not an excuse code for the front half dip that both the industry is experiencing and we're experiencing.Karan Juvekar -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. I just wanted to come back on the roster of content provider wins you mentioned. Just to be clear, are these all incremental to the existing run rates of business you're doing with these customers?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think, for the most part, the ICE7 subsea win is incremental. The hyperscaler OLS win for a new line system that we just announced in Q1 is, indeed, incremental on the systems side of things, and certainly the 800-gig win. So, those were the three largest that we talked about. The -- moving somebody over to ICE6 is actually, you know, an existing customer that we have that's moving on to the ICE6 platform.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. OK. And then for these wins, I assume then these are all contracted with, you know, the dollar values you guys have outlined, specified, or at least unit volumes that translate into those kinds of dollars specified, or I guess I just want to make sure that these are --David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah --George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Firm pieces of business that are in backlog now. And I guess I would have expected the bookings to be up more also given the strength here. I'm just trying to put it all together and think about the second half of the year and that ramp. Thanks.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer No, George, it's a good question, and I think we were pretty specific in our language here. You know, these design wins or RFP wins, when you win them, it's great. And when you -- you know, in many cases, you sign a contract. But then the volumes are based on the forecast that they then roll out. So, what we've given you is as we've negotiated these RFPs, these design wins, and price them, as well as the pluggable contract that we talked about, we get volumes, you know, kind of low range, medium range, high range. It's actually low and high from the customers. These are not hard-programmed volume to roll out in Quarter X, Y, and Z. That would be great because it would be much easier to do the quarterly predictions going forward. So, these are -- as we said, that should be worth these ranges, right, and that's based on the forecast we've gotten from the client that we've landed those deals at.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And is that a big element of the second half ramp? I assume it is given the conversation.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's a reasonable portion of the second half ramp. Many of them on the line system, the MOFN side, and then the pushouts of the ICP from Q1 and Q2. I mean, that's material to the second half. And when you look at the pluggable, the OLS win and the ICE7 win, that's more primary to 2025.George Notter -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, George.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Kang with B. Riley. Please go ahead.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is regarding the inventory situation. Just exactly how much excess inventories are out there, and are we pretty close or we still got maybe a few more quarters to go?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Well, certainly, there was enough to prevent 25 million of book-ship in the quarter. And, you know, call it, an equal number for Q2, as well as continued project pushouts. But we do think that things are beginning to thin down. And based on the RFP activity and the engagement we're having on both the ICP and the CSP side, you know, we believe things are narrowing down to where the second half -- there should be, again, that year-over-year growth, not just first half over second half growth, because this is, I think, a trough that you'll see in the industry that will begin to pick up in Q3 and Q4.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Got it. And then regarding all these multiple design wins you talked about, you know, ranging from, you know, $100 million to $300 million, are these, just for clarification, hard contracts where, you know, there's like a minimum, you know, amount or it's just forecast from these customers?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer No, these are -- I mean, look, these are all wins that then purchase orders are issued against, right? Either contracts or RFP wins or design wins where you then have quantities off against that. Now, part of that process we go through what volume over what period of time. And that's why there's such a wide range of we try to put a low and a high. And that's just to better educate folks on, you know, why we feel good about 2025 moving forward.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst And when would they start to, you know, hit your like backlog then?David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I mean, as you start to get out toward the end of this year, I think you would start to see that hit the backlog. That's, you know, kind of what would be normalized in a view of the growth rates we have in for Q3 and Q4 and for 2025.Dave Kang -- B. Riley Securities -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to David Heard for closing remarks.David Heard -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, certainly, as we mentioned, the start to the year was slower than expected as carriers and ICPs kind of held on to their orders and ran their networks a bit hotter than I think we all expected, and you'll see that going across the industry. But they are planning on expanding those 400-gig services and 800-gig services for high-capacity routes. As I said, you know, we're not the overall market analyst, but as we calculate, that probably says that there's a market decline in the front half. That's kind of temporary in nature, call it, digestion finalization of 20%, followed by growth in the back half, albeit still we're not pushing anything -- we're not pushing everything that was missed in the front half to the second half, for an overall decline in the optical market that's 7% to 8%. But the traffic generation in 400-gig subsea high-capacity routes and then ultimately inside the data center are going to drive, I think, the optical world to go back to that normalized next cycle on AI as we get into 2025. So, certainly, these RFP wins and, you know, fair questions, guys, on the -- it's not hardcoded contract value, but, you know, in the company's history, we just have not seen this kind of potential value of lining a brand new line system into ICPs, ICE7 wins already that are significant in nature, as well as on the pluggables side, which is, I think, going to drive a huge cost benefit for us, you know, for our long-term model. So, we all know optical is becoming more important to the network outside and inside the data center. And I think our strategy for VI is well positioned for the next optical cycle. So, I know the news on, you know, the Q1, you know, and the Q2 outlook well in line with the optical industry or a little bit better is not great. The prospects on that second half growth and even more importantly into 2025 is very, very strong. So, we'll continue to keep our heads down and focusing on execution and taking more than our fair share, driving operating efficiencies, and keeping transparent with what we see in the market as it develops. So, appreciate the thoughtful questions and engagement, and we'll be talking to you soon. Thanks, everybody. Have a great night.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Amitabh Passi -- Head of Investor RelationsDavid Heard -- Chief Executive OfficerNancy Erba -- Chief Financial OfficerSamik Chatterjee -- J.P.

      "VOXX International Corporation (VOXX)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VOXX International fiscal 2024 fourth quarter results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glenn Wiener. Sir, please begin.Glenn Wiener -- Investor Relations Thank you, Howard. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and year-end results conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-K and we issued our press, and both documents can be found in the investor relations section of the web site at www.voxxintl.com, and we'll be posting our updated investor presentation within the week. Speaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, chief executive officer; Loriann Shelton, chief financial officer and chief operating officer. As you may recall, Loriann took the reins as CFO in addition to her role as COO effective March 1st at the start of the company's fiscal year, and I would personally like to welcome Loriann to today's call. Welcome. And before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements.And I'd like to point you to the risk factors associated with our business, which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 29, 2024. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Pat. Pat? Pat Lavelle -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into our results and any business commentary, I wanted to pick up on where Glenn left off and formally welcome Loriann to today's call as it's her first as chief financial officer. I've worked with Loriann for over 30 years and she is simply the best at what she does. She knows our business inside and out, and I believe the investors will enjoy working with her as we all do at VOXX. Whoever is typing, if you can stop. Simply put, fiscal 2024 was even tougher than fiscal 2023 and the challenges we faced are reflected in our results. Like nearly every company serving our markets, we continue to feel the impact of a very challenging global economy. As we prepared for today's call, I look back on my remarks from last year. I said OEM customers shutting down production and retailers cutting back on orders, inflation and fears of recessions globally, gradual improvement in the supply chain but with higher cost of inventory, chip scarcity, which was expected to improve and an expected tough first half with the potential to improve with some possible easing by the Fed. Unfortunately, the issues we spoke of last May are almost the same we face today and we're expecting more of the same as we enter fiscal 2025. According to the latest index of consumer sentiment last week, there has been a significant drop in confidence. Consumer sentiment dropped to 67.4 from 77 in April, and this May's report was the lowest in six months. Even more alarming was the jump in year ahead inflation expectations to 3.5% from 3.2% and long run inflation expectations edging up to 3.1% from 3%. As you can see, inflation is still a major concern. Both customers and consumers are being cautious, as are we. And that is why we continue to take steps to restructure our business and bring VOXX back to profitability. Let me first quickly recap some of the annual financial comparisons followed by a more detailed update on our business segments. Loriann will then recap the quarter and talk more about our realignment plans, the steps we've taken and those upcoming, and then we'll open it up for questions. On a consolidated basis, net sales of approximately $469 million were down 12.2% year over year. Gross margins were down 80 basis points and the operating expenses improved a little over 2%. We recorded $14.2 million of noncash impairment charges on intangibles and restructuring expenses of $2.1 million. When accounting for these charges, as well as goodwill impairment charges and restructuring charges in fiscal '23, our year-over-year expenses declined closer to 7%. The result, however, was an operating loss of $44 million and a net loss attributable to VOXX of $40.9 million. And lastly, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of 3.4 million, which was down $6.3 million compared to fiscal '23. This marks two years of losses after two years of growth and profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. While this upcoming year again will be challenging, we believe we are taking the right steps to return VOXX to profitability. We plan to cut at minimum an additional 5% to 10% of our total overhead without affecting our ability to effectively serve our customers. Not only will we be cutting costs but we're also reviewing all products and programs, which I will cover in more detail during my market segments. Our programs are about rightsizing the company based on the projections that we see for this year. So, I'll start with the Automotive segment. Automotive segment sales of approximately $142 million were almost $32.5 million or approximately 19%. On the OEM side, sales declined by $14.7 million with a miss entirely in the rear seat entertainment category driven by several factors. The Nissan program ended this past year as scheduled. Another program saw volumes drop significantly despite customer projections, and all experienced starts and stops throughout the year. All of this took a big toll on not only sales but gross margins and absorption rates as well. On the other hand, our security, lighting, and safety business was up in fiscal 2025. Despite another warm winter season, we saw sales of OEM remote starts and security products grow, aided by new business with Ford that launched in the EMEA, and a number of new programs in our lighting and safety business that we've been awarded since our acquisition. We experienced the most severe OEM challenges during the second half as our business was almost cut in half during the Q3 due to the UAW strike, as well as production rates that simply have not kept up with projected customer take rates. We adjusted by reducing overhead, both headcount and expenses, in addition to moving certain OEM manufacturing to Mexico. But when your business is impacted this much, more drastic and prudent steps are needed and that's what we're in the process of doing. VOXX has been the market leader in rear seat entertainment for several decades. This is a niche market and we have taken advantages of our global relationships, as well as our strong engineering capabilities to maintain our market dominance. We intend to continue in RSE, but not at a loss or where profits are minimal and volumes fluctuate so rapidly. Not all of this is customer driven though. It's also heavily market and supply chain driven. It's just the nature of the environment we're operating in. But after months of negotiation and after what we feel is our best efforts to renegotiate based on revised lower volumes, we have decided to exit our rear seat entertainment business with Stellantis. This was not an easy decision, it was not taken lightly, but a lot has changed since we began with them in 2019. And we have reached the point where rising cost and lower volume has put us in a position where we can't agree on the right structure going forward. We can no longer support tying up precious working capital to secure inventory that produces no margin. Additionally, it's no secret Stellantis is having supply chain issues of its own with plant closures and lawsuits ongoing as they too try to combat inflation, which makes a change right now even more prudent. As for Ford, they, too, have faced similar industry wide challenges, but we've been working through them and fully intend to support Ford as we have in the past. The current RSE programs for the Expedition and the Navigator expire soon and shortly thereafter, we'll be launching on a new program for the 25 models. Our RSE program with Nissan has come to its scheduled end. However, we continue to work with Nissan on a new lighting program that just launched. We are also working on a lighting program with Ford and we have various other programs across our OEM business. We also have the United States Postal Service Business starting later this fiscal year. In summary, while our OEM business may be smaller than we had projected several years back, based on all the contract awards, we believe that the business we're maintaining going forward should be more consistent and profitable. Our automotive aftermarket business was down $17.7 million with the miss predominantly in the remote start category. Some aftermarket categories and product lines were up for the year, such as collision avoidance, car link, car connection and satellite radio, but the aftermarket overall was challenged in fiscal 2024 due to a number of reasons. One, the retail environment and the consumer. The changes in the way car dealers were operating this past year. And then there's car inflation, interest rates and the state of the domestic economy. As we look ahead into fiscal '25, inventory provisions in the aftermarket are far less of a challenge than at this time last year and that should help offset some of the projected economic softness. The first half will be tight on the OEM side simply given the volume of programs now and what's transitioning, but we should see a sizable ramp in the second half of the year. Sales should come in roughly in line with fiscal '24, maybe with some upside and gross margins should improve as well. Building in the second half consistent with the start of new OEM programs, we fully expect our Automotive segment to be profitable. As far as the consumer segment, we reported net sales of approximately 327 million, down roughly 31 million or 8.7%. Premium Audio sales declined by 36.6 million and other CE product sales grew by 5.5 million. Within Premium Audio, while sales were off for the year both domestically and internationally, in the Americas, they stabilized in the second half on the heels of several new product launches and new categories. And as I mentioned last quarter, I believe we are gaining market share. While industry wide premium audio sales continue to be on decline, we have either maintained or increased share domestically and we have a host of new products coming to market. Internationally, our business was down with the biggest impact in Asia. As we enter fiscal 2025, we are planning for two things. One is growth from new products. And two, is a very challenging retail environment, most likely consistent with what we've experienced as of late. I'll expand a little further as to what we're doing. First, we have a new soundbar offering led by our Klipsch Flexus sound system powered by Onkyo. We have begun delivery of our Flexus 100 and 200 systems and the Flexus 300 is scheduled for Q2 at a retail of $1,000. Our new Klipsch Music City broadcast bluetooth speakers are doing very well with three new models recently launched, the Klipsch Detroit, which is the flagship model and the Klipsch Austin and Nashville. Our first line of party speakers were launched in September of 2023, and we have several new models coming to market in the second half of this year. And as I mentioned previously, party speakers are one of the hottest categories in audio. There are a lot of new products that were launched or that we'll be launching moving into the second and third quarters, and we're expecting these products and categories to generate strong growth and better gross margins. The economy. Credit card debts are at all-time highs. Discretionary spending is down. Inflation is a major concern. We have uncertain elections upcoming and mounting geopolitical tension that could go on and on. The Fed not easing rates could have the biggest impact as it directly affects customers buying, consumers purchasing and the cost of doing business. And therefore, we are adjusting operations and overhead working to enhance margins and improve working capital within the segment based on our current economic outlook. As for other CE products, sales were up for the year, yet we faced the same challenges at retail. And why were they up? It's similar to my Q3 remarks. Two categories drove the growth. The first, our RCA hearing aids launched initially in fiscal 2024 with new and vastly improved models in the market this year. The second and more meaningful, the solar power balcony products launched in Germany earlier in the year, VOXX Germany sales were up close to 35% year over year. In more normalized times, I would probably be guiding to growth for the consumer segment in fiscal '25, but I would be remiss given the global economy, the audio market, the unknown with respect to inflation and any action or inaction by the Fed. I expect continued puts and takes. The regular pass of loudspeaker may drop a bit, but we will still see growth in new products in the sound bars, party speakers, and our new music series. The big thing is what we are doing to control inventory, improve margins, and lower cost to increase profitability. Moving on to biometrics. The big news on a go-forward basis was our March 7th release announcing a 50-50 joint venture between EyeLock and GalvanEyes Partners, forming a new company, BioCenturion LLC. The premise behind this move is simple, combine resources to create a more streamlined, focused, and nimble company to realize value while at the same time removing the working capital needs and losses incurred by VOXX. We're still sharing in the upside but our focus moving forward and where our resources will be allocated will be on our automotive and consumer segments. BioCenturion brings together each company's respective strengths in sales, marketing, business development, and R&D, and will be run by Allen Ibaugh who has experience with both entities. GalvanEyes will serve as the managing member responsible for all expenses and working capital needs over the next two years. After which, we'll evaluate the best path forward. If there is a capital event prior to the first $45 million, we'll get preferential distribution rights of 77% to EyeLock and 23% to GalvanEyes, and the remaining portion would be split evenly. We still very much believe in EyeLock and its future. The technology works very well. And there are deals on the horizon which we believe will change the landscape. With this move, we still share any upside without the financial or operational burden. I'd like to make a few comments with respect to our plans this year before I turn the call over to Loriann. With the losses of the past two years, our view of the economy near term and with the Seaguard ruling and final payout, we must conserve cash and return VOXX to profitability. And by conserving cash, what I really mean is monetizing capital. Of course, we will be cutting in every area where we can from an operational perspective. We will also be looking to remove redundancies throughout the organization, enhance our supply chain and operational support capabilities further and evaluating all products and programs to ensure they have more longevity and stronger margins and margin protection. When you look at VOXX, we have a lot of assets. We have assets in real estate, assets in our brands, assets in our respective groups and businesses. As part of restructuring, we're tackling every area of our business to ensure that we return to profitability sooner rather than later. And we are exploring all alternatives to reduce working capital needs further so that we can focus on our more growth oriented profitable business. Although sales have declined year over year, it is not due to lost market share. In Automotive, we in fact have increased the number of OEM customers we have worked with over the past two years. In the aftermarket, we maintain nine of the top 10 selling brands of remote start and security, and our market share is intact and stable. In our consumer business, we maintain number one market share in passive loudspeakers and reception products in North America and have made inroads into new accounts we have not done business with in the past. Unfortunately, we have had to stop selling in markets in Europe due to the war in Ukraine, like Russia and Belarus, and sales to the Ukraine, the Baltics and especially Poland have been impacted. We believe as the U.S. economy picks up, car sales grow, consumers return to more normal buying patterns and inflation eases, we will see a resurgence of our normal business on top of the new customers, categories and products we will bring to market in fiscal 2025. And with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori. Loriann?Loriann Shelton -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Pat. I appreciate the kind words. And good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be joining you on today's call. I look forward to working with our investors and communicating the VOXX story. I've been with the company for most of my adult life holding many positions, most importantly COO with the oversight of the shared services groups. So, my team touches virtually all aspects of our business. While we have our fair share of challenges to deal with, namely the economy first and foremost, we also have opportunities to strengthen our business and make sure we can weather whatever is thrown at us. We've been resilient and we've gotten through everyday, and this period will be no different. As for today, I won't review the financials as Pat covered the year and talked to our business segments, and the environment we're operating in. What I thought I would like to do today is quickly do some financial housekeeping on our year end results, talk a little bit about the quarter and then focus more on our balance sheet and what we are doing to strengthen it along with our performance. To start with respect to fiscal 2024, I wanted to provide a little more color around the intangible asset impairment charges. Throughout the year, we rely on our projections, our customers' projections, market conditions, the economy, competition, price adjustments, and things like these to help us value the carrying value of our assets. At fiscal 2024 year-end, our intangible assets stood at 68.8 million. The impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter and in our year end financial statements relate to four indefinite lives intangible assets that totaled 14.2 million. As a result of ongoing conversations with our customers and following meetings at CEs this past January, we lowered our long term projections with certain CE trade names resulting in these impairments this fiscal year. This compares to $1.3 million of intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023, both of which are noncash charges and are reflected in our P&L under operating expenses. This, of course, resulted in operating losses for both fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and fiscal year. We also incurred restructuring charges in fiscal 2024 of 2.1 million compared to approximately 900,000 in fiscal '23. This past year's restructuring cost primarily relates to severance expenses associated with headcount reductions in our fiscal 2024 second quarter, along with expenses related to our OEM production relocation from Florida to Mexico, which began in fiscal '23 and charges will continue through this fiscal year. We continue to analyze all aspects of our infrastructure and eliminate duplication throughout the organization. Our purchasing and inventory teams cleaned up our inventory, remove obsolete end of life and excess inventories, all done with goals to generate more profitable sales on lower overhead. A lot of our planning was also stented on lower and future working capital needs. I must caution everyone that while we did a lot to lower operating expenses in fiscal '24, which were down close to 7% when accounting for impairment and restructuring charges, more will be done in fiscal '25 in light of the current and near term business environment. There will be a lot of changes and not everything will occur at once. We have people and customers to consider, orders in process and in the pipelines that needs to be fulfilled over time. The plans we put in place will be executed with our customers' needs in mind above all. VOXX has been around for a long time for many reasons and one of them is integrity. We have always shown that we can adjust better than the competition and that it's important to our customers and to our market longevity. Same with fiscal 2024 and moving to gross margins. We took several inventory write offs, which impacted both the fourth quarter and fiscal year for both consolidated gross margins and our Automotive segment. In Automotive, where we reported gross margins of 21.1% compared to 24.3% for the year, we incurred an inventory write down of approximately $3.8 million, about a 270 basis-point impact to margin. This accounts for both slow moving or excess goods from our OEM manufacturing transition. I just wanted to point this out as it's a big impact but also puts us in a better position moving into fiscal 2025. One other point which Pat alluded to, to which should help you think about the automotive margins going forward, we expect to have lower margins in the first half as we exit lower margin OEM business. We then have new models coming online at more historical margin levels. On the consumer side, our inventory is in a good position with new products in market and number of new ones coming to market toward the end of our second quarter and into third. Here, too, you may start to see some margin pickup in the second half of the year, all things being equal, of course. Moving on to the quarter. As you can see our results in our press release, and I'd be more than happy to address any questions during the Q&A portion of our call or following. Let me briefly recap results as I'd like to spend a few minutes on our go-forward plans. Fourth quarter comparisons. Net sales of just 108 million were down 28.4 million or 20.8%. The automotive segment was down 16.9 million with the bigger miss in OEM. The consumer segment was down 11.4 million with both Premium Audio and other CE roughly evenly. Gross margins were down 550 basis points, which includes the impact of the inventory write downs, thus, the decline was not as great. Operating expenses were up 300,000, including the impairment of restructuring charges but excluding all charges as well as acquisition costs, operating expenses improved by over 13%. The result, an operating loss of 26.4 million compared to an operating loss of 12.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of 6.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of 4 million. As for VOXX today and what we are working on, as part of our fiscal 2025 realignment plans, we are looking at everything with a focus on reducing costs in light of a relatively flat sales year while preparing for worse. We are really looking to get leaner but not again at the expense of the customer. There's only so much you can remove from a functional perspective without losing skills and knowledge. So, we are focused equally on process. How we can improve process to do more with less is key to this technology. We're looking to automate more functions across all departments to free up not only cost but resources. Resources that can be used to enhance output or resale so that can be leveraged to support other areas of the business. We're looking at each department and location, how they function and where we can better share resources. We're looking at our operations, distribution and supply chain, looking to control costs on our end where we can, while at the same time working with partners to find more cost effective ways of getting the job done. We're also looking closely at each segment, group and/or business unit at sales, margin and expenses at contracts, agreements and future business. We're looking at profitability by brand, by product line, by customer, and SKU. Everything that will enhance profitability, while at the same time, lower our working capital needs and improve our balance sheet. With respect to our balance sheet, as of year-end, our cash and cash equivalents stood at 11 million and our total debt stood at 73.3 million, which takes into account the final payouts related to Seaguard settlement that is behind us now. Total debt is principally made up of outstanding borrowings on our senior secured credit facility with committed availability of up to 165 million. Our excess borrowing availability as of February 29, 2024 was 55.3 million, and we have sufficient working capital and availability to fund our business and meet all obligations. We are focused on generating cash from operations and cash through efficiencies and monetization to generate the best ROI on our capital. With that, I would like to thank you all. We're now ready to open up the call for questions.Glenn Wiener -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lori. Operator, if there are any questions?

      "VOXX International Corporation (VOXX)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VOXX International fiscal 2024 fourth quarter results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Glenn Wiener. Sir, please begin.Glenn Wiener -- Investor Relations Thank you, Howard. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and year-end results conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-K and we issued our press, and both documents can be found in the investor relations section of the web site at www.voxxintl.com, and we'll be posting our updated investor presentation within the week. Speaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, chief executive officer; Loriann Shelton, chief financial officer and chief operating officer. As you may recall, Loriann took the reins as CFO in addition to her role as COO effective March 1st at the start of the company's fiscal year, and I would personally like to welcome Loriann to today's call. Welcome. And before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements.And I'd like to point you to the risk factors associated with our business, which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 29, 2024. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Pat. Pat? Pat Lavelle -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I get into our results and any business commentary, I wanted to pick up on where Glenn left off and formally welcome Loriann to today's call as it's her first as chief financial officer. I've worked with Loriann for over 30 years and she is simply the best at what she does. She knows our business inside and out, and I believe the investors will enjoy working with her as we all do at VOXX. Whoever is typing, if you can stop. Simply put, fiscal 2024 was even tougher than fiscal 2023 and the challenges we faced are reflected in our results. Like nearly every company serving our markets, we continue to feel the impact of a very challenging global economy. As we prepared for today's call, I look back on my remarks from last year. I said OEM customers shutting down production and retailers cutting back on orders, inflation and fears of recessions globally, gradual improvement in the supply chain but with higher cost of inventory, chip scarcity, which was expected to improve and an expected tough first half with the potential to improve with some possible easing by the Fed. Unfortunately, the issues we spoke of last May are almost the same we face today and we're expecting more of the same as we enter fiscal 2025. According to the latest index of consumer sentiment last week, there has been a significant drop in confidence. Consumer sentiment dropped to 67.4 from 77 in April, and this May's report was the lowest in six months. Even more alarming was the jump in year ahead inflation expectations to 3.5% from 3.2% and long run inflation expectations edging up to 3.1% from 3%. As you can see, inflation is still a major concern. Both customers and consumers are being cautious, as are we. And that is why we continue to take steps to restructure our business and bring VOXX back to profitability. Let me first quickly recap some of the annual financial comparisons followed by a more detailed update on our business segments. Loriann will then recap the quarter and talk more about our realignment plans, the steps we've taken and those upcoming, and then we'll open it up for questions. On a consolidated basis, net sales of approximately $469 million were down 12.2% year over year. Gross margins were down 80 basis points and the operating expenses improved a little over 2%. We recorded $14.2 million of noncash impairment charges on intangibles and restructuring expenses of $2.1 million. When accounting for these charges, as well as goodwill impairment charges and restructuring charges in fiscal '23, our year-over-year expenses declined closer to 7%. The result, however, was an operating loss of $44 million and a net loss attributable to VOXX of $40.9 million. And lastly, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of 3.4 million, which was down $6.3 million compared to fiscal '23. This marks two years of losses after two years of growth and profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. While this upcoming year again will be challenging, we believe we are taking the right steps to return VOXX to profitability. We plan to cut at minimum an additional 5% to 10% of our total overhead without affecting our ability to effectively serve our customers. Not only will we be cutting costs but we're also reviewing all products and programs, which I will cover in more detail during my market segments. Our programs are about rightsizing the company based on the projections that we see for this year. So, I'll start with the Automotive segment. Automotive segment sales of approximately $142 million were almost $32.5 million or approximately 19%. On the OEM side, sales declined by $14.7 million with a miss entirely in the rear seat entertainment category driven by several factors. The Nissan program ended this past year as scheduled. Another program saw volumes drop significantly despite customer projections, and all experienced starts and stops throughout the year. All of this took a big toll on not only sales but gross margins and absorption rates as well. On the other hand, our security, lighting, and safety business was up in fiscal 2025. Despite another warm winter season, we saw sales of OEM remote starts and security products grow, aided by new business with Ford that launched in the EMEA, and a number of new programs in our lighting and safety business that we've been awarded since our acquisition. We experienced the most severe OEM challenges during the second half as our business was almost cut in half during the Q3 due to the UAW strike, as well as production rates that simply have not kept up with projected customer take rates. We adjusted by reducing overhead, both headcount and expenses, in addition to moving certain OEM manufacturing to Mexico. But when your business is impacted this much, more drastic and prudent steps are needed and that's what we're in the process of doing. VOXX has been the market leader in rear seat entertainment for several decades. This is a niche market and we have taken advantages of our global relationships, as well as our strong engineering capabilities to maintain our market dominance. We intend to continue in RSE, but not at a loss or where profits are minimal and volumes fluctuate so rapidly. Not all of this is customer driven though. It's also heavily market and supply chain driven. It's just the nature of the environment we're operating in. But after months of negotiation and after what we feel is our best efforts to renegotiate based on revised lower volumes, we have decided to exit our rear seat entertainment business with Stellantis. This was not an easy decision, it was not taken lightly, but a lot has changed since we began with them in 2019. And we have reached the point where rising cost and lower volume has put us in a position where we can't agree on the right structure going forward. We can no longer support tying up precious working capital to secure inventory that produces no margin. Additionally, it's no secret Stellantis is having supply chain issues of its own with plant closures and lawsuits ongoing as they too try to combat inflation, which makes a change right now even more prudent. As for Ford, they, too, have faced similar industry wide challenges, but we've been working through them and fully intend to support Ford as we have in the past. The current RSE programs for the Expedition and the Navigator expire soon and shortly thereafter, we'll be launching on a new program for the 25 models. Our RSE program with Nissan has come to its scheduled end. However, we continue to work with Nissan on a new lighting program that just launched. We are also working on a lighting program with Ford and we have various other programs across our OEM business. We also have the United States Postal Service Business starting later this fiscal year. In summary, while our OEM business may be smaller than we had projected several years back, based on all the contract awards, we believe that the business we're maintaining going forward should be more consistent and profitable. Our automotive aftermarket business was down $17.7 million with the miss predominantly in the remote start category. Some aftermarket categories and product lines were up for the year, such as collision avoidance, car link, car connection and satellite radio, but the aftermarket overall was challenged in fiscal 2024 due to a number of reasons. One, the retail environment and the consumer. The changes in the way car dealers were operating this past year. And then there's car inflation, interest rates and the state of the domestic economy. As we look ahead into fiscal '25, inventory provisions in the aftermarket are far less of a challenge than at this time last year and that should help offset some of the projected economic softness. The first half will be tight on the OEM side simply given the volume of programs now and what's transitioning, but we should see a sizable ramp in the second half of the year. Sales should come in roughly in line with fiscal '24, maybe with some upside and gross margins should improve as well. Building in the second half consistent with the start of new OEM programs, we fully expect our Automotive segment to be profitable. As far as the consumer segment, we reported net sales of approximately 327 million, down roughly 31 million or 8.7%. Premium Audio sales declined by 36.6 million and other CE product sales grew by 5.5 million. Within Premium Audio, while sales were off for the year both domestically and internationally, in the Americas, they stabilized in the second half on the heels of several new product launches and new categories. And as I mentioned last quarter, I believe we are gaining market share. While industry wide premium audio sales continue to be on decline, we have either maintained or increased share domestically and we have a host of new products coming to market. Internationally, our business was down with the biggest impact in Asia. As we enter fiscal 2025, we are planning for two things. One is growth from new products. And two, is a very challenging retail environment, most likely consistent with what we've experienced as of late. I'll expand a little further as to what we're doing. First, we have a new soundbar offering led by our Klipsch Flexus sound system powered by Onkyo. We have begun delivery of our Flexus 100 and 200 systems and the Flexus 300 is scheduled for Q2 at a retail of $1,000. Our new Klipsch Music City broadcast bluetooth speakers are doing very well with three new models recently launched, the Klipsch Detroit, which is the flagship model and the Klipsch Austin and Nashville. Our first line of party speakers were launched in September of 2023, and we have several new models coming to market in the second half of this year. And as I mentioned previously, party speakers are one of the hottest categories in audio. There are a lot of new products that were launched or that we'll be launching moving into the second and third quarters, and we're expecting these products and categories to generate strong growth and better gross margins. The economy. Credit card debts are at all-time highs. Discretionary spending is down. Inflation is a major concern. We have uncertain elections upcoming and mounting geopolitical tension that could go on and on. The Fed not easing rates could have the biggest impact as it directly affects customers buying, consumers purchasing and the cost of doing business. And therefore, we are adjusting operations and overhead working to enhance margins and improve working capital within the segment based on our current economic outlook. As for other CE products, sales were up for the year, yet we faced the same challenges at retail. And why were they up? It's similar to my Q3 remarks. Two categories drove the growth. The first, our RCA hearing aids launched initially in fiscal 2024 with new and vastly improved models in the market this year. The second and more meaningful, the solar power balcony products launched in Germany earlier in the year, VOXX Germany sales were up close to 35% year over year. In more normalized times, I would probably be guiding to growth for the consumer segment in fiscal '25, but I would be remiss given the global economy, the audio market, the unknown with respect to inflation and any action or inaction by the Fed. I expect continued puts and takes. The regular pass of loudspeaker may drop a bit, but we will still see growth in new products in the sound bars, party speakers, and our new music series. The big thing is what we are doing to control inventory, improve margins, and lower cost to increase profitability. Moving on to biometrics. The big news on a go-forward basis was our March 7th release announcing a 50-50 joint venture between EyeLock and GalvanEyes Partners, forming a new company, BioCenturion LLC. The premise behind this move is simple, combine resources to create a more streamlined, focused, and nimble company to realize value while at the same time removing the working capital needs and losses incurred by VOXX. We're still sharing in the upside but our focus moving forward and where our resources will be allocated will be on our automotive and consumer segments. BioCenturion brings together each company's respective strengths in sales, marketing, business development, and R&D, and will be run by Allen Ibaugh who has experience with both entities. GalvanEyes will serve as the managing member responsible for all expenses and working capital needs over the next two years. After which, we'll evaluate the best path forward. If there is a capital event prior to the first $45 million, we'll get preferential distribution rights of 77% to EyeLock and 23% to GalvanEyes, and the remaining portion would be split evenly. We still very much believe in EyeLock and its future. The technology works very well. And there are deals on the horizon which we believe will change the landscape. With this move, we still share any upside without the financial or operational burden. I'd like to make a few comments with respect to our plans this year before I turn the call over to Loriann. With the losses of the past two years, our view of the economy near term and with the Seaguard ruling and final payout, we must conserve cash and return VOXX to profitability. And by conserving cash, what I really mean is monetizing capital. Of course, we will be cutting in every area where we can from an operational perspective. We will also be looking to remove redundancies throughout the organization, enhance our supply chain and operational support capabilities further and evaluating all products and programs to ensure they have more longevity and stronger margins and margin protection. When you look at VOXX, we have a lot of assets. We have assets in real estate, assets in our brands, assets in our respective groups and businesses. As part of restructuring, we're tackling every area of our business to ensure that we return to profitability sooner rather than later. And we are exploring all alternatives to reduce working capital needs further so that we can focus on our more growth oriented profitable business. Although sales have declined year over year, it is not due to lost market share. In Automotive, we in fact have increased the number of OEM customers we have worked with over the past two years. In the aftermarket, we maintain nine of the top 10 selling brands of remote start and security, and our market share is intact and stable. In our consumer business, we maintain number one market share in passive loudspeakers and reception products in North America and have made inroads into new accounts we have not done business with in the past. Unfortunately, we have had to stop selling in markets in Europe due to the war in Ukraine, like Russia and Belarus, and sales to the Ukraine, the Baltics and especially Poland have been impacted. We believe as the U.S. economy picks up, car sales grow, consumers return to more normal buying patterns and inflation eases, we will see a resurgence of our normal business on top of the new customers, categories and products we will bring to market in fiscal 2025. And with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori. Loriann?Loriann Shelton -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Pat. I appreciate the kind words. And good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be joining you on today's call. I look forward to working with our investors and communicating the VOXX story. I've been with the company for most of my adult life holding many positions, most importantly COO with the oversight of the shared services groups. So, my team touches virtually all aspects of our business. While we have our fair share of challenges to deal with, namely the economy first and foremost, we also have opportunities to strengthen our business and make sure we can weather whatever is thrown at us. We've been resilient and we've gotten through everyday, and this period will be no different. As for today, I won't review the financials as Pat covered the year and talked to our business segments, and the environment we're operating in. What I thought I would like to do today is quickly do some financial housekeeping on our year end results, talk a little bit about the quarter and then focus more on our balance sheet and what we are doing to strengthen it along with our performance. To start with respect to fiscal 2024, I wanted to provide a little more color around the intangible asset impairment charges. Throughout the year, we rely on our projections, our customers' projections, market conditions, the economy, competition, price adjustments, and things like these to help us value the carrying value of our assets. At fiscal 2024 year-end, our intangible assets stood at 68.8 million. The impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter and in our year end financial statements relate to four indefinite lives intangible assets that totaled 14.2 million. As a result of ongoing conversations with our customers and following meetings at CEs this past January, we lowered our long term projections with certain CE trade names resulting in these impairments this fiscal year. This compares to $1.3 million of intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023, both of which are noncash charges and are reflected in our P&L under operating expenses. This, of course, resulted in operating losses for both fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and fiscal year. We also incurred restructuring charges in fiscal 2024 of 2.1 million compared to approximately 900,000 in fiscal '23. This past year's restructuring cost primarily relates to severance expenses associated with headcount reductions in our fiscal 2024 second quarter, along with expenses related to our OEM production relocation from Florida to Mexico, which began in fiscal '23 and charges will continue through this fiscal year. We continue to analyze all aspects of our infrastructure and eliminate duplication throughout the organization. Our purchasing and inventory teams cleaned up our inventory, remove obsolete end of life and excess inventories, all done with goals to generate more profitable sales on lower overhead. A lot of our planning was also stented on lower and future working capital needs. I must caution everyone that while we did a lot to lower operating expenses in fiscal '24, which were down close to 7% when accounting for impairment and restructuring charges, more will be done in fiscal '25 in light of the current and near term business environment. There will be a lot of changes and not everything will occur at once. We have people and customers to consider, orders in process and in the pipelines that needs to be fulfilled over time. The plans we put in place will be executed with our customers' needs in mind above all. VOXX has been around for a long time for many reasons and one of them is integrity. We have always shown that we can adjust better than the competition and that it's important to our customers and to our market longevity. Same with fiscal 2024 and moving to gross margins. We took several inventory write offs, which impacted both the fourth quarter and fiscal year for both consolidated gross margins and our Automotive segment. In Automotive, where we reported gross margins of 21.1% compared to 24.3% for the year, we incurred an inventory write down of approximately $3.8 million, about a 270 basis-point impact to margin. This accounts for both slow moving or excess goods from our OEM manufacturing transition. I just wanted to point this out as it's a big impact but also puts us in a better position moving into fiscal 2025. One other point which Pat alluded to, to which should help you think about the automotive margins going forward, we expect to have lower margins in the first half as we exit lower margin OEM business. We then have new models coming online at more historical margin levels. On the consumer side, our inventory is in a good position with new products in market and number of new ones coming to market toward the end of our second quarter and into third. Here, too, you may start to see some margin pickup in the second half of the year, all things being equal, of course. Moving on to the quarter. As you can see our results in our press release, and I'd be more than happy to address any questions during the Q&A portion of our call or following. Let me briefly recap results as I'd like to spend a few minutes on our go-forward plans. Fourth quarter comparisons. Net sales of just 108 million were down 28.4 million or 20.8%. The automotive segment was down 16.9 million with the bigger miss in OEM. The consumer segment was down 11.4 million with both Premium Audio and other CE roughly evenly. Gross margins were down 550 basis points, which includes the impact of the inventory write downs, thus, the decline was not as great. Operating expenses were up 300,000, including the impairment of restructuring charges but excluding all charges as well as acquisition costs, operating expenses improved by over 13%. The result, an operating loss of 26.4 million compared to an operating loss of 12.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of 6.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of 4 million. As for VOXX today and what we are working on, as part of our fiscal 2025 realignment plans, we are looking at everything with a focus on reducing costs in light of a relatively flat sales year while preparing for worse. We are really looking to get leaner but not again at the expense of the customer. There's only so much you can remove from a functional perspective without losing skills and knowledge. So, we are focused equally on process. How we can improve process to do more with less is key to this technology. We're looking to automate more functions across all departments to free up not only cost but resources. Resources that can be used to enhance output or resale so that can be leveraged to support other areas of the business. We're looking at each department and location, how they function and where we can better share resources. We're looking at our operations, distribution and supply chain, looking to control costs on our end where we can, while at the same time working with partners to find more cost effective ways of getting the job done. We're also looking closely at each segment, group and/or business unit at sales, margin and expenses at contracts, agreements and future business. We're looking at profitability by brand, by product line, by customer, and SKU. Everything that will enhance profitability, while at the same time, lower our working capital needs and improve our balance sheet. With respect to our balance sheet, as of year-end, our cash and cash equivalents stood at 11 million and our total debt stood at 73.3 million, which takes into account the final payouts related to Seaguard settlement that is behind us now. Total debt is principally made up of outstanding borrowings on our senior secured credit facility with committed availability of up to 165 million. Our excess borrowing availability as of February 29, 2024 was 55.3 million, and we have sufficient working capital and availability to fund our business and meet all obligations. We are focused on generating cash from operations and cash through efficiencies and monetization to generate the best ROI on our capital. With that, I would like to thank you all. We're now ready to open up the call for questions.Glenn Wiener -- Investor Relations Thank you, Lori. Operator, if there are any questions?

      "Dynatrace (DT -0.76%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGreetings and welcome to the Dynatrace fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Noelle Faris, vice president of investor relations for Dynatrace. Thank you. You may begin.Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor Relations Good morning and thank you for joining Dynatrace's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, chief executive officer; and Jim Benson, chief financial officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance, and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our upcoming annual report on Form 10-K that we plan to file later this month. The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on May 15, 2024. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events, or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth rate, and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call.To see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the financial results section of our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Rick McConnell. Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Dynatrace delivered a very strong finish to fiscal 2024, having achieved several noteworthy milestones and accomplishments. We surpassed $1.5 billion in ARR, representing 50% growth compared to the $1 billion level two years ago. We landed our first nine-figure TCV deal. We closed our largest new logo ever, a nearly eight-figure ACV deal. Top analyst firms named Dynatrace a leader nine times in reports on observability and AIOps over the past year. Entering fiscal 2024, we added approximately 300 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin from fiscal 2023, plus grew pre-tax free cash flow margins by 200 basis points. There are three key themes I'd like to highlight as we begin today's call. First, we are confident that our end-to-end platform is a meaningful differentiator in the expanding observability market. Second, we are benefiting from the evolution toward larger, more strategic observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives, and we expect this trend to persist. And third, we continue to execute with a business model that is well-balanced in growth and profitability. Jim will share more details about our Q4 and FY '24 performance, fiscal 2025 guidance, and the share repurchase program we announced earlier today in a moment. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some of the key wins in the quarter, the market opportunity, investments in ongoing platform innovation, and our go-to-market evolution. Starting with some notable wins. Last quarter, we shared that we were seeing increased demand for large strategic deals in which customers were looking to make broader observability architecture decisions. Our thesis was that Dynatrace is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend given our proven track record of helping customers eliminate siloed tools, significantly improve software performance and user experience, reduce cost, and drive organizational innovation and productivity. Our Q4 results showed that this thesis played out as we had expected. We successfully closed numerous platform consolidation deals, contributing to a record 18 seven-figure ACV wins in the quarter. Among these were the following. We won a nine-figure multiyear TCV expansion with a top 20 global financial institution. In a POC, the customer found Dynatrace to have the most advanced offering for cloud and container environments, resulting in dramatically reduced time and cost to prevent and resolve incidents. I'm also very pleased that this deal was closed in conjunction with Accenture. We won a mid-eight-figure TCV expansion deal with a Fortune 50 corporation. This company is in the process of moving to the cloud and selected Dynatrace to displace their existing monitoring solutions. As part of their digital transformation efforts, they are aiming to have 70% of their applications and 75% of their data in public or private clouds by the end of the year. Dynatrace's end-to-end observability platform was selected to provide a view across their entire hybrid and multi-cloud environment. We landed a nearly eight-figure ACV new logo with one of the world's largest airlines. It is yet another tool consolidation win, but what ultimately led to this selection was our focus on their business transformation initiatives and how Dynatrace could help them seamlessly transport more than half a million passengers every day. And we won a seven-figure expansion deal with a large healthcare company that is seeking to enable its developers to focus on innovation rather than performance issues or vulnerabilities. Dynatrace's real-time vulnerability analytics and contextual awareness proved the perfect fit and made up nearly half of this expansion deal. We believe that these types of larger strategic deals will be a material contributor to our long-term growth. And while we are extremely pleased with the number of these large strategic deals that closed in the quarter, they do come with an increased level of variability that will continue to necessitate a prudent approach to guidance. Interest for our newer offerings, including log monitoring and application security, also continues to grow, especially for those customers leveraging our Dynatrace Platform Subscription, or DPS, contract vehicle. The airline deal I just mentioned is our largest DPS transaction to date, and they are already leveraging log monitoring. In Q4, approximately 70% of our new logo deals were closed with DPS licensing, and we've increased the number of DPS customers from 100 to over 700 since DPS became generally available just over a year ago. DPS is now our default offering for new logos, and we are driving increased penetration in our installed base. While it is still early, consumption for DPS customers is growing at a significantly faster rate than our ARR growth. Also of note, partner momentum is building. Fifteen of these 18 seven-figure deals were closed in collaboration with partners, especially GSIs and hyperscalers. Turning next to the market. We believe that our success in closing anchor deals provides evidence of the tailwind in what is already a large and growing space. Cloud modernization and gen AI are additional catalysts. Two weeks ago, AWS, Azure, and GCP reported a combined annualized revenue of nearly $220 billion, growing 24% year over year. Each of the hyperscalers mentioned the underlying growth drivers of workloads moving to the cloud, as well as gen AI. Andy Jassy from Amazon stated that 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises, and this is before we contemplate gen AI impact. We believe that gen AI will, over time, materially increase developer productivity. This, in turn, is expected to result in radically more data, as well as complexity, both of which play to the strengths and differentiation of Dynatrace given our more than a decade of leadership in AI. On the innovation front, we see our R&D engine as driving an ongoing stream of technology advancements. Last year, we released a game-changing platform evolution with Grail, an integrated, highly performant, and massively scalable data store that keeps all data types, metrics, logs, traces, real user data, business events, together in context, providing near real-time end-to-end awareness. Grail serves as the foundation for all of our solutions, including full stack, infrastructure, log monitoring, and application security. Throughout fiscal 2024, the team's relentless focus on market-leading innovation was evident with the plethora of platform enhancements that provide further monetization opportunities in core, as well as adjacent areas. We believe the Dynatrace platform is highly differentiated and delivers unmatched business value in driving the business transformation initiatives that executives care most about. Our platform is integrated from the front end to the back end. We have a single underlying data store where each of the solutions access that data store through the same set of core technologies. We have the industry's leading causal and predictive AI technologies, along with automation that provides precise answers in context. In contrast, our peers generally have a series of separate data stores that are aggregated only at the user interface level through manual error-prone tagging. This may be effective for SMB companies, but large, complex enterprises recognize the value of Dynatrace's end-to-end platform, with automation and AI enabling them to deliver much more performance software in a highly enriched end-user experience. We continue to receive exceptional third-party recognition of our platform and resultant market leadership. Most recently, we were named a leader in the 2024 GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud Observability Solutions, positioned as the vendor closest to the center of the radar. Dynatrace was also recognized as a Customers' Choice in the 2024 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for Digital Experience Monitoring Report, the only provider to receive this distinction. We are humbled by this ongoing third-party validation of our strategic differentiation, and we remain committed to our ongoing investment to maintain this leadership position. Turning last to our go-to-market strategy. We recently hosted our annual Kickoff in Orlando with our global sales team. The energy and excitement were at an all-time high. Over the past 10 months, we have added several seasoned leaders with extensive experience scaling large go-to-market functions with the addition of our chief revenue officer, chief marketing officer, and SVP of partner and alliances. Sales Kickoff provided this new leadership team the opportunity to share their vision and specific plans to execute on our fiscal 2025 go-to-market strategy. We are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market approach in three local areas to drive deeper penetration within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership to maximize the opportunity in front of us. First is customer segmentation. We will be increasing the focus of our sales force on the Global 500 and strategic enterprise accounts to drive the highest productivity with the accounts that have the largest potential ARR. Territory and account coverage changes have already been communicated, and we are executing accordingly. We are also expanding our international reach and sector specialization, consistent with this segmentation approach. And we will be investing in customer success to align these resources to our segmentation mapping to ensure successful deployment, adoption, and expansion. The second go-to-market area, which I mentioned earlier, is our focus on partners. Partners, today, influence more than two-thirds of our ARR, but they account for only 30% of deal origination, highlighting the enormous whitespace of opportunity in this area. We are focusing our energy on our highest priority and most impactful partners. We are building a dedicated partner enablement engine to scale our priority partners. And we are simplifying our economic model with partner-neutral compensation and a co-sale approach with hyperscalers to remove friction and drive closer collaboration. The third and final go-to-market focal area relates to harnessing our competitive differentiation to drive broader market adoption and deeper installed base penetration. We will increasingly focus on end-to-end observability opportunities, as we have discussed. We will continue to drive application performance engagements, our traditional sales motion that enables us to land and expand across our customers' workloads. And finally, we will target cloud modernization efforts, in which platform engineers and DevOps teams are responsible for how their organizations develop and release software and require complete visibility of data at scale. In closing, we delivered a fantastic finish to fiscal 2024, and I'd like to thank the approximately 4,700 Dynatracers globally for their incredible commitment to innovation and excellence this past year. As we look to fiscal 2025, I'm highly enthusiastic about our prospects. Finishing where I began, the market for observability and application security is growing rapidly. Our end-to-end platform differentiates us and puts us in a strong competitive position. And finally, we have a solid business model that continues to deliver a strong balance of growth and profitability. Jim, over to you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was, indeed, a very strong finish to fiscal 2024. Once again, we surpassed the high end of our top-line growth and profitability guidance metrics. Our value proposition continues to resonate as enterprises look to consolidate their siloed monitoring tools into a unified observability platform, specifically architected to address the growing complexity inherent in dynamic, multi-cloud enterprise environments. Our results reflect relentless execution by the Dynatrace team, the criticality of observability and application security in the market, and our platform differentiation. Now, let's dive into the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results in more detail. Please note, the growth rates mentioned will be on a year-over-year basis and in constant currency unless otherwise stated. Beginning with annual recurring revenue or ARR. In Q4, as Rick mentioned, we surpassed the $1.5 billion threshold for ARR, representing 20% growth. This result was 100 basis points above the high end of guidance, driven primarily by our strong execution, including many of the large strategic observability architecture vendor consolidation deals we outlined in our last earnings call. Our EMEA geo, in particular, had a tremendous finish to the year. We added $84 million of constant currency net new ARR in the quarter, driven by a record number of seven-figure competitive wins, our largest nearly eight-figure ACV new logo land, and our first-ever nine-figure TCV expansion. These results clearly demonstrate enterprise customers are choosing Dynatrace for our highly differentiated, unified platform with contextual analytics, AI leadership, and data-driven automation. We closed 168 new logos in the fourth quarter, for a total of 692 new logos for the fiscal year, roughly consistent with the year ago. A number of the seven-figure deals added in the quarter were new logos and contributed to the average new logo land size of roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we have shared in the past, we are focused on the quality of new logo lands that have a greater propensity to expand. Our value proposition continues to resonate with enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions, seeking business value and tool consolidation, and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth, and automation of our unified observability platform. Once customers experience the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, they are quick to expand their usage. Our average ARR per customer continues to increase and is approaching $400,000, highlighting the business value we provide to customers. Our gross retention rate is in the mid-90s and continues to be best in class in our industry; and net retention rate, or NRR, was over 111% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with nearly 4,000 Dynatrace customers, representing an increase of 10% over last year. Our DPS licensing model continues to see strong traction. As Rick noted, we now have over 700 DPS customers, representing more than 18% of our customer base and over a third of our ARR. We believe our simplified, cross-platform DPS licensing model will further contribute to growth in NRR over time as customers can more easily gain greater access to newer solutions, encounter less friction in the buying process, and enjoy more flexible, predictable, and transparent pricing, all of which should lead to more consumption of the capabilities in the platform and deliver more business value for our customers. And while it's still early days for our DPS customers, we're seeing very healthy usage across the platform. In fact, consumption of the platform for DPS customers is growing nearly two times faster than non-DPS customers and an indication of increasing expansion opportunity in the future. Turning to our emerging solution areas of logs and application security traction. We now have roughly 600 customers leveraging each of these solutions, and consumption for these offerings is growing very rapidly, north of 100% exiting fiscal 2024. As such, we remain confident in our ability to exceed the $100 million annualized revenue thresholds we set for ourselves some time ago. However, based on current consumption trends, it is more likely we will surpass these thresholds during fiscal 2026 rather than the end of fiscal 2025. Nothing has changed relative to the market opportunity or our competitive differentiation, but the increasing market shift away from point solutions to broader end-to-end observability platform decisions is impacting the sequencing and ramping of deploying these new solutions. Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $381 million, 21% growth and $4 million above the high end of our guidance. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter was $360 million, 22% growth and $2 million above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to margins. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84%, consistent with last year. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, $5 million above the high end of guidance due to the combination of revenue upside and disciplined expense management. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%, exceeding the top end of guidance by nearly 100 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $89 million or $0.30 per diluted share. This is $0.02 above the high end of guidance, primarily driven by the items I just highlighted. Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full year. Total revenue was $1.43 billion, representing 22% growth. Subscription revenue was $1.36 billion, representing 24% growth. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $398 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. This result is 50 basis points above the high end of guidance and nearly 300 basis points above fiscal 2023 as we have consistently demonstrated our ability to drive further leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $358 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS includes an effective cash tax rate of 17.4%. Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31st, we had $883 million of cash and investments and zero debt. Our free cash flow was $121 million in the fourth quarter and $346 million for the full year, or 24% of revenue, exceeding the high end of guidance by 100 basis points. As a reminder, this strong cash flow result includes absorbing nearly 600 basis points impact of cash taxes. Adjusted for cash taxes, fiscal 2024 pre-tax cash flow was up 34%, representing 30% of revenue and up more than 200 basis points year over year. As our free cash flow profile evolves, our capital allocation strategy also evolves. Our top priority continues to be investing in the business, both organically and through solution adjacency acquisitions, to help drive sustainable long-term growth. Even as we strategically invest, we are equally committed to driving increased free cash flow. Given our strong profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet, we also believe the time is right to add a share repurchase program as another strategic use of capital. As we announced today, our board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which we plan to utilize opportunistically based on market conditions. This program underscores our confidence in the business, our conviction in the significant long-term opportunities ahead, and our commitment to driving exceptional shareholder value. With that, let me turn to guidance. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity for Dynatrace. The addressable market is large and growing. The observability and security ecosystem is expanding. The demand environment remains healthy. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our ARR growth. Our platform and growing capabilities are highly differentiated. And our financial model is both balanced and durable. Near term, we are mindful of the ongoing dynamic macro landscape. And while we've seen resiliency in the observability market, we believe it's appropriate to continue to assume a challenging macro climate in our guidance philosophy. Enterprises continue to be cautious in their spending, and our approach to guidance assumes that ongoing budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles will persist through fiscal 2025. We also expect the growing trend of larger, more strategic deals related to observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives will continue. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. At the same time, these deals come with increased timing variability and longer duration to close. Lastly, as Rick outlined, we are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market strategy in fiscal 2025. These changes are all designed to drive deeper penetration and customer intimacy within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership, especially with strategic, enterprise, and global account segments. With more than 30% of our accounts now transitioned to new sales reps, our guidance incorporates the potential for some near-term impact from these changes as they will take time to mature and begin positively impacting our sales performance. And with that as an opener, let's start with our guidance for the full year, with growth rates in constant currency. We expect ARR to be between $1.72 billion and $1.735 billion, representing ARR growth of 15% to 16%. And while we don't guide to ARR on a quarterly basis, we expect the quarterly seasonality of net new ARR to be similar to fiscal 2024. We expect to provide an update on our full year ARR guidance on our fiscal Q2 earnings call when we have a better sense of our go-to-market traction. Turning now to revenue. We expect total revenue for the full year to be $1.644 billion to $1.658 billion, up 16% to 17% year over year. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be $1.571 billion and $1.585 billion, up 16% to 17%. Based on foreign exchange rates as of April 30, 2024, we expect a $10 million headwind to both ARR and revenue for fiscal year 2025. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $459 million and $467 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% for the year. This represents an anticipated 25-basis-point improvement over fiscal 2024. We plan to continue prioritizing investments in R&D, sales capacity, customer success, and our partnership program while realizing additional leverage in other areas. We expect non-GAAP net income to be $383 million to $392 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.29 per diluted share, based on roughly 303 million to 305 million shares outstanding. Given the strength of our profitability on a GAAP basis, we fully utilize our remaining tax credit carryforwards in fiscal 2024. Further, given our R&D is primarily outside the U.S., we are significantly impacted by Internal Revenue Code Section 174, which requires a 15-year capitalization and amortization period for international R&D. As such, we expect an increase in our effective cash tax rate and related cash taxes in fiscal 2025. Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 22%, up from 17% in fiscal 2024. We expect the cash tax rate to stabilize in the low 20s going forward. With incremental cash taxes factored in, we expect free cash flow to be between $386 million to $398 million or 23.5% to 24% of revenue. The anticipated free cash flow impact from cash taxes is approximately $110 million, or 7% of revenue, up from $81 million, or 6% of revenue, in fiscal 2024. Excluding cash taxes, pre-tax free cash flow is expected to be between 30% and 30.5%, up 50 basis points from fiscal 2024 at the high end of the range. As a helpful reminder for your modeling, due to seasonality and variability in billings, we expect significantly higher free cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and significantly lower free cash flow in the second and third quarters. Looking now at Q1. We expect total revenue to be between $391 million and $393 million or 18% to 19% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $374 million and $376 million, up 19% year over year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $105 million and $108 million or 27% to 27.5% of revenue. Lastly, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30 per diluted share, based on a share count of approximately 301 million to 302 million shares. In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 performance. We are balancing conviction in our long-term opportunity with near-term prudence as we evolve our go-to-market to drive customer adoption and support our growing pipeline of large competitive displacement opportunities. We have a strong track record of consistent execution. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to optimizing costs, improving efficiency and profitability. At the same time, we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the Q4. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of these large deals that you landed in Q4, you know, a nine-figure TCV deal, an eight-figure land deal. Sort of reaffirms what you guys have been telling us the last couple of quarters that there's a lot of these large strategic deals in the pipeline, and it looks like you guys got to close a healthy amount of them in Q4. Rick, I was wondering if you want to put the go-to-market changes that you have planned for the early part of the year in the context of the success you're seeing with these large enterprise deals, should I take the go-to-market changes, meaning that you're kind of focused more down market and other customer segments, or you just need more sort of sales capacity to close more volume of deals? Given the success that we've seen landing in Q4, I'd love to just better understand the rationale for some of these go-to-market changes that you have planned for the first half. Thank you.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Sanjit. The short-form answer is that we're seeing increased momentum, increased traction, increased centralization of the end-to-end observability and broad-based observability architecture decisions. And the result of that is that's where you focus your sales energy. So, in the go-to-market evolution, our focus on things like customer segmentation and partners really to address that end-to-end observability architecture approach is very consistent with what we're seeing in the market. And that's the bet that we're making heading into FY '25.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. The only other thing I'd add to that is, Sanjit, it's actually providing more resource at the top of the pyramid. So, if you think about the Global 500, the propensity for spend there is significantly higher than those customers that are below that. So, we are weighting more resource at the higher end of the pyramid. So, that's primarily what we're doing, and it's in line with what Rick outlined, which is more end-to-end observability decisions tend to occur with very large enterprise customers where our value proposition really thrives.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It was great to see the validation of the thesis. And 18 anchor deals closed in Q4, greater than $1 million, so seven-figure ACV deals, very, very strong performance.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah, I know, very impressive. As a follow-up and just in terms of what sort of underpins the guidance, it's certainly not you're assuming any sort of improvement in outlook. If you look at some of the things that could drive upside to your guidance, you know, what would be some of the swing factors, if you will, that could get the ARR, you know, north of the 15% guidance?Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Sanjit. I'll take that. That's a good question that as we outlined kind of as a context for the guidance, we did suggest that, hey, we think the macro environment is not going to improve. It's not going to worsen. Customers are still leveraging observability as a priority. We did outline that we do expect this trend of architecture for observability decisions to continue. And as we outlined around some of these go-to-market enhancements, what we're doing is we're building in some prudence. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that roughly 30% of our accounts are going to have a new rep. That's already taking place. So, this is not like it's going to change throughout the year, but we've changed accounts per rep. We know, at times, that can result in some near-term disruption. We've tried to factor that in. So, to answer your question directly, to the extent we can minimize that, to the extent some of these larger deals, the timing of them occurs faster, I think those would be two factors that would drive improvement to this guide.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Very clear, Jim. Thank you so much.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi. Thank you very much. One question for Rick and one for Jim. So, Rick, clearly, the move up market is working. You're landing big deals, very strategic engagements. And that's great. But it does look like the net expansion rate on a trailing 12-month basis came down. So, wondering if you could talk about the other side of the fence, the mid-market business and what's happening there and what could happen there? And one for you, Jim. It looks like net new ARR -- first of all, I got to tell you that you guys are one of the very few that disclose net new ARR. So, thanks for the transparency. The year was down but the quarter was up. Trend is getting better, right? If this trend holds, notwithstanding the changes to the field organization, what does that do to the guidance? Thank you so much.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Let me take the first one, Kash. So, relative to the net new ARR, in particular, the question around mid-market, the strategy around mid-market is really partners. We talk about that a lot. We are definitely leaned in relative to GSIs and hyperscalers, and that is really how we would expect to attack the mid-market space, which is through that avenue. Jim, on the second piece.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, relative to the net new ARR, one of the things, you are right, that if you look at the guide, this guide would suggest a slight moderation in net new ARR for the year for fiscal '25. As I mentioned to Sanjit, I think there are factors that could drive improvement to that. We actually felt that it was important to start with a guide that we thought reflected some prudence given some of the changes that we outlined. I would tell you, as you know, just from a seasonality perspective, the other thing we included in the prepared remarks is you should expect the net new ARR, call it, seasonality to be similar to what it was in fiscal '24, which is lighter in the first half and heavier in the second half, in Q1, in particular. Because it's the first quarter of the year, Q1 is seasonally our lightest quarter. So --Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Jim, you went through that. That was crystal clear. Absolutely. Appreciate that. But, Rick, on the mid-market, what's happening in the mid-market? So, why couldn't net expansion rates be back to the 118, 119 that they were, versus the 111? Looks like the swing factor is really mid-market because the large enterprise is doing really, really well. Thank you so much. I appreciate your patience.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I would say again that partners really are going to drive the mid-market for us, especially hyperscalers. If you get more granular, Kash, we would expect GSIs to be headed up market, if anything. You look at the nine-digit TCV Accenture deal with a large global financial institution, that's the kind of thing that we're going to see out of GSIs. Hyperscaler engagements, we announced the partnership -- go-to-market partnership with GCP in the past quarter as well. Those are the elements that will likely drive NRR in the mid-market.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. A couple from me. I wanted to ask or go back to the record 18 seven-figure deals and wanted to ask how often was Grail a part of those big deals? And when speaking about consolidation, was a part of that logs on Grail replacing incumbent vendors?Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yes and yes. Grail is part of essentially every SaaS deal that we do at this point. So, Grail, remember, is not equal to logs. Grail is underlying massively parallel processing data store for enormous amounts of data that can be accessed to store all sorts of different data types, logs, traces, metrics, etc. Logs access Grail, and logs are a key element of this end-to-end observability architecture approach. What customers are finding is that the log element really should not be viewed as an independent data type or an independent avenue for things like root cause analysis. They instead want to incorporate all data types into one universal observability orientation. It drives better user experience. It drives lower cost. It drives better outcomes. And so, logs on Grail are very typically part of the Grail deployments.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. No, thank you for that. And maybe a follow-up for Jim here. In the past, you said that, internally, the company thinks of the business as a Rule of 50-type business, 20% plus ARR growth, with the remainder coming from pre-tax free cash flow. And so, looking at the guide today, a bit shy of that target. You know, appreciate all the commentary on why the guidance is starting the way that it is. But it does sound like, you know, when you're looking at the Rule of 50-type business profile, it's mostly falling short from the AAR growth side of the equation. And so, how do you view the shape of ARR growth over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months to achieve that target, or are you thinking about that target a bit differently now? Thank you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer No, you're -- it's a great question, Koji. We still do view very much internally this Rule of 50. You're absolutely right. We've done a fantastic job driving leverage in the model with 30% pre-tax free cash flow margins. So, the guide would suggest we're going to be a bit below that for fiscal '25. You can certainly imagine that we're driving the business to a better outcome on the top line. So, that's -- that is certainly our ambition. And the changes that we're making on the go-to-market side that Rick outlined, we know those changes may take a little while to kind of mature, but those are the changes that we believe will lead to acceleration in ARR growth. And so, which -- that will be the driver of getting us back to Rule of 50.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you for taking the questions.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor Relations Keith, are you there?Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Keith.OperatorI'm sorry.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. [Technical difficukty] for taking the question. I wanted to direct my first question on the why. And what I mean by that is if we take -- the feedback that we get from channel, it's pretty universally that Dynatrace has leading technology, particularly with the advent of Grail. And yet, if I look at the trend from '22, '23, '24, and what you're guiding to for '25, there's a steady erosion of growth, particularly if I focus on net new. And while I appreciate you've made some comments on there are some changes to go-to-market and whatnot, this has been an ongoing trend, and I'm just trying to maybe tease out the why a little bit more about the deceleration, particularly in light of if I superimpose our views of what security and logs are doing, it suggests the legacy or core, if you will, is having a more meaningful deceleration. And I'm just trying to understand why because the elongation of deal cycles, you would think that that anniversaries at some point in time. So, it's hard to reconcile that with the amount of deceleration that you're demonstrating. And, you know, is it because the underlying market of APM is slowing down, or is it the fact that you guys are focused on the largest customers, so perhaps bend is tighter there? Just, you know, really trying to understand not just what this quarter is, which was an excellent quarter, but really what's the trend over the last couple of years and why is there such significant slowdown and deceleration because it doesn't seem that go-to-market fully explains it.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I could start with that, and, Rick, you can offer. So, one, I'd remind you -- excuse me, that the time frame that you're talking about is a time frame where the macro environment worsened materially. So, a moderation in growth rates. Look at anyone in the software sector. That generally has affected all software companies. So, that is not unique to Dynatrace. So, I would say the growth moderation is not an anomaly. I would concur that, you know, the -- this guide specifically for fiscal '25 is prudent. I think we are building changes for the company for the long term. We've not abandoned the land-and-expand model at all. So, that's still a predominant motion. But we do believe, in order to get the penetration and growth that we need, an adjustment to the go-to-market model was needed. We needed to get more weighting of resources to higher propensity to spend customers. And these customers are the customers that are offering -- it's a sweet spot for them. Our value proposition is really oriented to very enterprise-oriented, complex environment companies. Ensuring we had the right focus there is what we needed to adjust. That is largely the driver. So, these changes that we're making, we think, are focusing on the right profile of customers for the value proposition that we provide and that, once we navigate through this, will lead to a reacceleration.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Keith, I would simply add that we've gone through a platform transition really to Grail, number one. Number two, we've gone through a go-to-market transition. So, there have been a couple of transitions amid this macro environment that Jim described as well. And as we think about these trends toward end-to-end observability architecture decisions that play to our favor, combined with the strength of Grail, the strength of the platform underlying it, along with these go-to-market changes to take advantage of this market trend, we're very optimistic as we look to the future.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. OK. Terrific. And, Jim, maybe I'll just direct my follow-on question, which relates to that. You indicated that the $100 million targets that you had previously anticipated for '25 are pushing into '26. Was that for both security and for logs? And what -- you know, which -- in past conversations, I think you had some more optimism, if you will, around logs. But maybe if you could just tease out a little bit why those are being pushed out, and did I hear you correctly that sort of both are pushing into '26?Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, you did. So, I'll start with we're making very good traction with both of those. So, both areas, we have 600-plus customers leveraging either our application security solution and 600 on the log side. So, we're getting good traction. I would say, on the adoption side, I've always said, on logs, in particular, that the adoption would take a while and that there would be a requirement for an uptick in the back half of fiscal '25. Again, we still have confidence. And so, the market is still good for those offerings. I think our competitive differentiation is still compelling. So, I think they will be $100 million-plus businesses. We just wanted to be open that we think that that might extend. And the reason is, as we see a growing trend of these end-to-end observability decisions from customers, what we have found, and it's still early days, is they sequence what they deploy. And when they sequence what they deploy, sometimes they're deploying application observability, infrastructure monitoring, things of that nature first. And logs and application security are like on their road map, but those are, call it -- those are following. And so, the adoption of those areas, we believe, are probably going to push a little bit. So, we think these businesses will still be $100 million-plus businesses. We do think this trend of what we're seeing with platform consolidation will change the sequencing and adoption of some of these new emerging areas.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Terrific. Many thanks for taking the questions.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would also just add, the increase in number of log customers to 600, which is up 30% quarter-over-quarter, increase -- similar increase in the number of AppSec customers. So, we continue to see traction and continue to see deployment in these core areas, with substantial growth in consumption.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. OK. Terrific. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Thank you. As we -- as you guys kind of pursue these larger ideals, obviously, there's only like a few -- like can you talk a little bit about, like, the changes in the vendor landscape that you kind of dealing with then? Is that like a consolidation of tools? Are you replacing things? And then on the replacement side, there's obviously then just one big one that comes to mind, but that kind of seem to have locked in a lot of their customers on kind of renewals. Can you talk a little bit about the timing then that we could see here in terms of like getting some and then kind of the building momentum on the larger deal size? Thank you.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Raimo, the landscape is evolving, as I mentioned earlier, really toward an increased view toward centralization of the overall landscape and decisions associated with observability. What we saw, for example, in the large airline example that we provided in our prepared remarks, was they felt they were spending too much money to get too little user experience and too many incidents. By consolidating multiple different vendors together, they thought they would improve user experience, reduce cost, and dramatically reduce the number of incidents. And this is the trend that we're seeing. There are, frankly, just very few vendors in the space that can provide this solution to that landscape orientation, and Dynatrace is a core among them.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Yeah. OK. Perfect. And then the -- for Jim, like in the previous quarters, you talked a little bit about the needs for investments, etc., and you were one of the first to point out that I need to pre-invest into sales capacity, etc. If I look at the guidance and the numbers now, it actually looks like you're kind of managing to kind of still show us good profitability levels and still seem to invest well. Can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives you're doing there to achieve that? Thank you and congrats from me as well.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer You're right, Raimo, that, you know, one of the things you've always gotten with Dynatrace is a commitment to continue to try to drive leverage and drive balance, you know, as evidenced by what is almost 300 basis points of operating margin expansion this year, 200 basis points of free cash flow. We're going to -- we are continuing to drive scale across the business. So, you saw leverage in G&A. You should expect to see more leverage in G&A. These things we're doing around cloud hosting costs, where, potentially, we can drive some modest leverage in gross margin. So, I would say, it's multiple and it's, call it, modest in areas, but it adds up. The areas that we are making very specific investments are we are making very specific investments in R&D. We expect R&D to actually, as a percent of revenue, to grow in fiscal '25. We do think on the sales and marketing side, we will see a little bit of leverage. Some of that leverage will come from to Rick's opening point about partners and driving more through partners. But I do want to make it clear, we are also going to make incremental sales rep investments in fiscal '25. So, there will be investments in sales capacity, in addition to kind of getting better partner leverage and productivity. So, it's a bunch of different areas, and what we're committed to is to stabilize and/or expand margins for the business.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hey. It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. So, on the partner side, sounds again like great contribution for partners on those large seven-figure deals. You talked to some whitespace around new logos for partners in the prepared remarks. Just wondering what maybe can you do to help the origination side of the equation for partners.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the whole purpose of driving partners is really for that origination. We already have a very substantial percentage of partner-influenced deals. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, over two-thirds of deals are already partner-influenced, so we are deeply engaged with the partner community already. The real thrust around our partner initiatives is to drive that 30% origination higher, which is precisely what we're doing with the GSIs and the hyperscalers. So, that is the major thrust of our partner strategy.Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Good morning. I know you mentioned that the changes in the sales force changing up 30% of your logos. I guess, have you done this in the past and what have you seen? And effectively, what are you trying to achieve? It seems like a pretty big change in the go-to-market. So, I'm just curious if you could double-click on what you expect to achieve through this.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, I'll take that. So, every year, there is some modest level of account movement. So, that's, call it, not unique. I'd say it is -- what is unique is having 30% of your accounts now kind of move to a new rep. But just to be clear, again, one of the things that we're doing is the sweet spot for Dynatrace is in very large enterprise environments. And when we looked at the resource coverage that we had in the Global 500, we felt we needed to weight more investment there. We needed more sales capacity there, that the number of accounts per rep and that part of the kind of coverage pyramid was not the density that we wanted. So, we are making more investments. Some of that investment is just reallocating investments from, call it, the mid-commercial to the strategic global accounts. Obviously, the whole point of this is those customers have a greater propensity to spend. The more we can do to get better coverage with them, the more -- I would say the more intimacy and the more penetration we can get for their spend. And so, the whole point of it is to drive more dedication of observability spend to Dynatrace with those customers and also garner some new logos in that space that we don't have today. So, that's really the focus. And then to Rick's point, it's also leveraging partners kind of in the broader ecosystem. And certainly, at the bottom end of the pyramid, it's an inside sales motion, which we've had in the past, but adding more capacity there with an inside sales motion. But all of these changes are designed to drive better productivity and to drive an acceleration in bookings and ultimately ARR growth.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. And I think maybe just tying back to the guide, these actions are accounting for the deceleration you're seeing despite all the hyperscalers seeing accelerating growth and growth that's --Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst You know, anywhere between high teens to 40%-plus.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I would say what we're doing is we're trying to build some prudence that when you make go-to-market changes like this, we're mindful that, sometimes, these changes can cause reps to pause. You have reps that are learning new accounts, reps that are building relationships, things of that nature, and that we are trying to build in some prudence that there may be some near-term impact from this account movement. As I said, I think it was to Sanjit, what could allow us to do better is if we -- if -- as we transition through this, if this disruption that we're modeling doesn't occur, then we could deliver a better outcome. And that's certainly what we're striving to do.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just, Jim, for you. I wanted to unpack the dollar-based net retention rate performance in the quarter. I know macro hasn't necessarily gotten worse, but I was hoping you could speak to some of the puts and takes on that heading 111% or a two-point sequential deceleration in the quarter. And if you can paint a pathway for us as to the time and slope of a reexpansion in this metric, especially when I, you know, superimpose some of your commentary around how successful the consumption trends under the DPS selling vehicle are going. So, I was hoping you could bridge the gap for us in terms of some of the lightness and the compression this quarter and how we can get back to a path toward, you know, your historical 120% levels. And a quick follow-up, please.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Right. So, that I'd say you're right, that the NRR was at -- was just -- it was -- you know, I'd say it rounded down from 112 to 111. So, a little bit lighter. But I think that's largely driven by the fact that, you know, we had a very, very strong new logo quarter. And so, sometimes, you have quarters where new logos are stronger than expansions. We had a very good new logo quarter. You did highlight some important things to make sure we comment on is DPS as a vehicle, it's still early days, making good traction, 18% of our customers. Now, call it 30-plus percent of our ARR. The fact that these customers are consuming faster is a -- think of it as a leading indicator. It is a leading indicator that if they consume faster, it means they're getting more value out of the platform. It means they're consuming at a faster rate, which means that is a leading indicator of future expansion. We're relatively early days with DPS, so you think of the cohorts that we have that we've only been at it for a year. And so, it will take a little bit of time for this to manifest itself in expansion and in NRR, but that is the expectation. And the leading indicator we're seeing is DPS as a contracting vehicle is doing exactly what we thought, which is it allows customers to access the platform without committed SKU-based items that they are dollar-based commitment. They're leveraging as much of the platform. They have an ability to leverage all the product capabilities. The fact that they're consuming at a rapid rate means that we believe that you will see an earlier expansion that otherwise would have occurred under a SKU-based model. Will we -- I think we will see some of that in fiscal '25. But I think, you know, exiting fiscal '25 is when you'll see even more of that.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst I appreciate that. And just on the point of new logo and new logo growth, I know, historically, you've talked about an algorithm between acquiring the logos and, you know, going down the expansion path with your very loyal and very large customers who, you know, have that propensity to spend. But I'm curious if you can please comment on how you're thinking about the new logo trajectory in fiscal '25 in the context of, you know, rebalancing some of your sales capacity resources and, you know, straddling the quality versus the quantity dynamic of a new logo acquisition. Thank you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a great question. I would say the model hasn't fundamentally changed as far as, you know, that I'd say, today, of our ARR, 40% of our ARR roughly comes from new logos, 60% from expansion. That's not going to change fundamentally. Your comment about quantity versus quality of we are very focused on the quality. I'm not as focused on the quantity. What we have found is that if we land customers at greater than 100K of ARR, they expand much faster. Obviously, what you've seen is this growing trend of architecture decisions. You're going to have some quarters, like we had in the fourth quarter, where you're overweighted in that area, and they're very, very, very, very large. So, I'd say we're focused more on the quality of the land. Some of these go-to-market changes that we've outlined, I think, are again geared toward more quantity. A little bit in the mid-market, but I'd say it's primarily quality. And so, the, call it, the equation we think about is, call it, roughly 40% of the ARR coming from new, 60% from expansion. And I think that's probably going to continue.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you so much.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer All right. Well, thank you all for your questions and ongoing support. We saw Q4 as a very strong finish to fiscal 2024 and establishing momentum as we head into the new fiscal year. We are quite bullish about the opportunity for end-to-end observability decisions to come. We look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor RelationsRick McConnell -- Chief Executive OfficerJim Benson -- Chief Financial OfficerSanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystKoji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystKeith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- AnalystDan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- AnalystFatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst\n",

      "Dynatrace (DT -0.76%)Q4 2024 Earnings CallMay 15, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGreetings and welcome to the Dynatrace fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Noelle Faris, vice president of investor relations for Dynatrace. Thank you. You may begin.Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor Relations Good morning and thank you for joining Dynatrace's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, chief executive officer; and Jim Benson, chief financial officer. Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance, and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our upcoming annual report on Form 10-K that we plan to file later this month. The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on May 15, 2024. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events, or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth rate, and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call.To see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the financial results section of our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Rick McConnell. Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Dynatrace delivered a very strong finish to fiscal 2024, having achieved several noteworthy milestones and accomplishments. We surpassed $1.5 billion in ARR, representing 50% growth compared to the $1 billion level two years ago. We landed our first nine-figure TCV deal. We closed our largest new logo ever, a nearly eight-figure ACV deal. Top analyst firms named Dynatrace a leader nine times in reports on observability and AIOps over the past year. Entering fiscal 2024, we added approximately 300 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin from fiscal 2023, plus grew pre-tax free cash flow margins by 200 basis points. There are three key themes I'd like to highlight as we begin today's call. First, we are confident that our end-to-end platform is a meaningful differentiator in the expanding observability market. Second, we are benefiting from the evolution toward larger, more strategic observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives, and we expect this trend to persist. And third, we continue to execute with a business model that is well-balanced in growth and profitability. Jim will share more details about our Q4 and FY '24 performance, fiscal 2025 guidance, and the share repurchase program we announced earlier today in a moment. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some of the key wins in the quarter, the market opportunity, investments in ongoing platform innovation, and our go-to-market evolution. Starting with some notable wins. Last quarter, we shared that we were seeing increased demand for large strategic deals in which customers were looking to make broader observability architecture decisions. Our thesis was that Dynatrace is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend given our proven track record of helping customers eliminate siloed tools, significantly improve software performance and user experience, reduce cost, and drive organizational innovation and productivity. Our Q4 results showed that this thesis played out as we had expected. We successfully closed numerous platform consolidation deals, contributing to a record 18 seven-figure ACV wins in the quarter. Among these were the following. We won a nine-figure multiyear TCV expansion with a top 20 global financial institution. In a POC, the customer found Dynatrace to have the most advanced offering for cloud and container environments, resulting in dramatically reduced time and cost to prevent and resolve incidents. I'm also very pleased that this deal was closed in conjunction with Accenture. We won a mid-eight-figure TCV expansion deal with a Fortune 50 corporation. This company is in the process of moving to the cloud and selected Dynatrace to displace their existing monitoring solutions. As part of their digital transformation efforts, they are aiming to have 70% of their applications and 75% of their data in public or private clouds by the end of the year. Dynatrace's end-to-end observability platform was selected to provide a view across their entire hybrid and multi-cloud environment. We landed a nearly eight-figure ACV new logo with one of the world's largest airlines. It is yet another tool consolidation win, but what ultimately led to this selection was our focus on their business transformation initiatives and how Dynatrace could help them seamlessly transport more than half a million passengers every day. And we won a seven-figure expansion deal with a large healthcare company that is seeking to enable its developers to focus on innovation rather than performance issues or vulnerabilities. Dynatrace's real-time vulnerability analytics and contextual awareness proved the perfect fit and made up nearly half of this expansion deal. We believe that these types of larger strategic deals will be a material contributor to our long-term growth. And while we are extremely pleased with the number of these large strategic deals that closed in the quarter, they do come with an increased level of variability that will continue to necessitate a prudent approach to guidance. Interest for our newer offerings, including log monitoring and application security, also continues to grow, especially for those customers leveraging our Dynatrace Platform Subscription, or DPS, contract vehicle. The airline deal I just mentioned is our largest DPS transaction to date, and they are already leveraging log monitoring. In Q4, approximately 70% of our new logo deals were closed with DPS licensing, and we've increased the number of DPS customers from 100 to over 700 since DPS became generally available just over a year ago. DPS is now our default offering for new logos, and we are driving increased penetration in our installed base. While it is still early, consumption for DPS customers is growing at a significantly faster rate than our ARR growth. Also of note, partner momentum is building. Fifteen of these 18 seven-figure deals were closed in collaboration with partners, especially GSIs and hyperscalers. Turning next to the market. We believe that our success in closing anchor deals provides evidence of the tailwind in what is already a large and growing space. Cloud modernization and gen AI are additional catalysts. Two weeks ago, AWS, Azure, and GCP reported a combined annualized revenue of nearly $220 billion, growing 24% year over year. Each of the hyperscalers mentioned the underlying growth drivers of workloads moving to the cloud, as well as gen AI. Andy Jassy from Amazon stated that 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises, and this is before we contemplate gen AI impact. We believe that gen AI will, over time, materially increase developer productivity. This, in turn, is expected to result in radically more data, as well as complexity, both of which play to the strengths and differentiation of Dynatrace given our more than a decade of leadership in AI. On the innovation front, we see our R&D engine as driving an ongoing stream of technology advancements. Last year, we released a game-changing platform evolution with Grail, an integrated, highly performant, and massively scalable data store that keeps all data types, metrics, logs, traces, real user data, business events, together in context, providing near real-time end-to-end awareness. Grail serves as the foundation for all of our solutions, including full stack, infrastructure, log monitoring, and application security. Throughout fiscal 2024, the team's relentless focus on market-leading innovation was evident with the plethora of platform enhancements that provide further monetization opportunities in core, as well as adjacent areas. We believe the Dynatrace platform is highly differentiated and delivers unmatched business value in driving the business transformation initiatives that executives care most about. Our platform is integrated from the front end to the back end. We have a single underlying data store where each of the solutions access that data store through the same set of core technologies. We have the industry's leading causal and predictive AI technologies, along with automation that provides precise answers in context. In contrast, our peers generally have a series of separate data stores that are aggregated only at the user interface level through manual error-prone tagging. This may be effective for SMB companies, but large, complex enterprises recognize the value of Dynatrace's end-to-end platform, with automation and AI enabling them to deliver much more performance software in a highly enriched end-user experience. We continue to receive exceptional third-party recognition of our platform and resultant market leadership. Most recently, we were named a leader in the 2024 GigaOm Radar Report for Cloud Observability Solutions, positioned as the vendor closest to the center of the radar. Dynatrace was also recognized as a Customers' Choice in the 2024 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for Digital Experience Monitoring Report, the only provider to receive this distinction. We are humbled by this ongoing third-party validation of our strategic differentiation, and we remain committed to our ongoing investment to maintain this leadership position. Turning last to our go-to-market strategy. We recently hosted our annual Kickoff in Orlando with our global sales team. The energy and excitement were at an all-time high. Over the past 10 months, we have added several seasoned leaders with extensive experience scaling large go-to-market functions with the addition of our chief revenue officer, chief marketing officer, and SVP of partner and alliances. Sales Kickoff provided this new leadership team the opportunity to share their vision and specific plans to execute on our fiscal 2025 go-to-market strategy. We are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market approach in three local areas to drive deeper penetration within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership to maximize the opportunity in front of us. First is customer segmentation. We will be increasing the focus of our sales force on the Global 500 and strategic enterprise accounts to drive the highest productivity with the accounts that have the largest potential ARR. Territory and account coverage changes have already been communicated, and we are executing accordingly. We are also expanding our international reach and sector specialization, consistent with this segmentation approach. And we will be investing in customer success to align these resources to our segmentation mapping to ensure successful deployment, adoption, and expansion. The second go-to-market area, which I mentioned earlier, is our focus on partners. Partners, today, influence more than two-thirds of our ARR, but they account for only 30% of deal origination, highlighting the enormous whitespace of opportunity in this area. We are focusing our energy on our highest priority and most impactful partners. We are building a dedicated partner enablement engine to scale our priority partners. And we are simplifying our economic model with partner-neutral compensation and a co-sale approach with hyperscalers to remove friction and drive closer collaboration. The third and final go-to-market focal area relates to harnessing our competitive differentiation to drive broader market adoption and deeper installed base penetration. We will increasingly focus on end-to-end observability opportunities, as we have discussed. We will continue to drive application performance engagements, our traditional sales motion that enables us to land and expand across our customers' workloads. And finally, we will target cloud modernization efforts, in which platform engineers and DevOps teams are responsible for how their organizations develop and release software and require complete visibility of data at scale. In closing, we delivered a fantastic finish to fiscal 2024, and I'd like to thank the approximately 4,700 Dynatracers globally for their incredible commitment to innovation and excellence this past year. As we look to fiscal 2025, I'm highly enthusiastic about our prospects. Finishing where I began, the market for observability and application security is growing rapidly. Our end-to-end platform differentiates us and puts us in a strong competitive position. And finally, we have a solid business model that continues to deliver a strong balance of growth and profitability. Jim, over to you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was, indeed, a very strong finish to fiscal 2024. Once again, we surpassed the high end of our top-line growth and profitability guidance metrics. Our value proposition continues to resonate as enterprises look to consolidate their siloed monitoring tools into a unified observability platform, specifically architected to address the growing complexity inherent in dynamic, multi-cloud enterprise environments. Our results reflect relentless execution by the Dynatrace team, the criticality of observability and application security in the market, and our platform differentiation. Now, let's dive into the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results in more detail. Please note, the growth rates mentioned will be on a year-over-year basis and in constant currency unless otherwise stated. Beginning with annual recurring revenue or ARR. In Q4, as Rick mentioned, we surpassed the $1.5 billion threshold for ARR, representing 20% growth. This result was 100 basis points above the high end of guidance, driven primarily by our strong execution, including many of the large strategic observability architecture vendor consolidation deals we outlined in our last earnings call. Our EMEA geo, in particular, had a tremendous finish to the year. We added $84 million of constant currency net new ARR in the quarter, driven by a record number of seven-figure competitive wins, our largest nearly eight-figure ACV new logo land, and our first-ever nine-figure TCV expansion. These results clearly demonstrate enterprise customers are choosing Dynatrace for our highly differentiated, unified platform with contextual analytics, AI leadership, and data-driven automation. We closed 168 new logos in the fourth quarter, for a total of 692 new logos for the fiscal year, roughly consistent with the year ago. A number of the seven-figure deals added in the quarter were new logos and contributed to the average new logo land size of roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. As we have shared in the past, we are focused on the quality of new logo lands that have a greater propensity to expand. Our value proposition continues to resonate with enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions, seeking business value and tool consolidation, and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth, and automation of our unified observability platform. Once customers experience the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, they are quick to expand their usage. Our average ARR per customer continues to increase and is approaching $400,000, highlighting the business value we provide to customers. Our gross retention rate is in the mid-90s and continues to be best in class in our industry; and net retention rate, or NRR, was over 111% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with nearly 4,000 Dynatrace customers, representing an increase of 10% over last year. Our DPS licensing model continues to see strong traction. As Rick noted, we now have over 700 DPS customers, representing more than 18% of our customer base and over a third of our ARR. We believe our simplified, cross-platform DPS licensing model will further contribute to growth in NRR over time as customers can more easily gain greater access to newer solutions, encounter less friction in the buying process, and enjoy more flexible, predictable, and transparent pricing, all of which should lead to more consumption of the capabilities in the platform and deliver more business value for our customers. And while it's still early days for our DPS customers, we're seeing very healthy usage across the platform. In fact, consumption of the platform for DPS customers is growing nearly two times faster than non-DPS customers and an indication of increasing expansion opportunity in the future. Turning to our emerging solution areas of logs and application security traction. We now have roughly 600 customers leveraging each of these solutions, and consumption for these offerings is growing very rapidly, north of 100% exiting fiscal 2024. As such, we remain confident in our ability to exceed the $100 million annualized revenue thresholds we set for ourselves some time ago. However, based on current consumption trends, it is more likely we will surpass these thresholds during fiscal 2026 rather than the end of fiscal 2025. Nothing has changed relative to the market opportunity or our competitive differentiation, but the increasing market shift away from point solutions to broader end-to-end observability platform decisions is impacting the sequencing and ramping of deploying these new solutions. Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $381 million, 21% growth and $4 million above the high end of our guidance. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter was $360 million, 22% growth and $2 million above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to margins. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84%, consistent with last year. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, $5 million above the high end of guidance due to the combination of revenue upside and disciplined expense management. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%, exceeding the top end of guidance by nearly 100 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $89 million or $0.30 per diluted share. This is $0.02 above the high end of guidance, primarily driven by the items I just highlighted. Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full year. Total revenue was $1.43 billion, representing 22% growth. Subscription revenue was $1.36 billion, representing 24% growth. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $398 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. This result is 50 basis points above the high end of guidance and nearly 300 basis points above fiscal 2023 as we have consistently demonstrated our ability to drive further leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $358 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS includes an effective cash tax rate of 17.4%. Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31st, we had $883 million of cash and investments and zero debt. Our free cash flow was $121 million in the fourth quarter and $346 million for the full year, or 24% of revenue, exceeding the high end of guidance by 100 basis points. As a reminder, this strong cash flow result includes absorbing nearly 600 basis points impact of cash taxes. Adjusted for cash taxes, fiscal 2024 pre-tax cash flow was up 34%, representing 30% of revenue and up more than 200 basis points year over year. As our free cash flow profile evolves, our capital allocation strategy also evolves. Our top priority continues to be investing in the business, both organically and through solution adjacency acquisitions, to help drive sustainable long-term growth. Even as we strategically invest, we are equally committed to driving increased free cash flow. Given our strong profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet, we also believe the time is right to add a share repurchase program as another strategic use of capital. As we announced today, our board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which we plan to utilize opportunistically based on market conditions. This program underscores our confidence in the business, our conviction in the significant long-term opportunities ahead, and our commitment to driving exceptional shareholder value. With that, let me turn to guidance. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity for Dynatrace. The addressable market is large and growing. The observability and security ecosystem is expanding. The demand environment remains healthy. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our ARR growth. Our platform and growing capabilities are highly differentiated. And our financial model is both balanced and durable. Near term, we are mindful of the ongoing dynamic macro landscape. And while we've seen resiliency in the observability market, we believe it's appropriate to continue to assume a challenging macro climate in our guidance philosophy. Enterprises continue to be cautious in their spending, and our approach to guidance assumes that ongoing budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles will persist through fiscal 2025. We also expect the growing trend of larger, more strategic deals related to observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives will continue. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. At the same time, these deals come with increased timing variability and longer duration to close. Lastly, as Rick outlined, we are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market strategy in fiscal 2025. These changes are all designed to drive deeper penetration and customer intimacy within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership, especially with strategic, enterprise, and global account segments. With more than 30% of our accounts now transitioned to new sales reps, our guidance incorporates the potential for some near-term impact from these changes as they will take time to mature and begin positively impacting our sales performance. And with that as an opener, let's start with our guidance for the full year, with growth rates in constant currency. We expect ARR to be between $1.72 billion and $1.735 billion, representing ARR growth of 15% to 16%. And while we don't guide to ARR on a quarterly basis, we expect the quarterly seasonality of net new ARR to be similar to fiscal 2024. We expect to provide an update on our full year ARR guidance on our fiscal Q2 earnings call when we have a better sense of our go-to-market traction. Turning now to revenue. We expect total revenue for the full year to be $1.644 billion to $1.658 billion, up 16% to 17% year over year. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be $1.571 billion and $1.585 billion, up 16% to 17%. Based on foreign exchange rates as of April 30, 2024, we expect a $10 million headwind to both ARR and revenue for fiscal year 2025. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $459 million and $467 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% for the year. This represents an anticipated 25-basis-point improvement over fiscal 2024. We plan to continue prioritizing investments in R&D, sales capacity, customer success, and our partnership program while realizing additional leverage in other areas. We expect non-GAAP net income to be $383 million to $392 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.29 per diluted share, based on roughly 303 million to 305 million shares outstanding. Given the strength of our profitability on a GAAP basis, we fully utilize our remaining tax credit carryforwards in fiscal 2024. Further, given our R&D is primarily outside the U.S., we are significantly impacted by Internal Revenue Code Section 174, which requires a 15-year capitalization and amortization period for international R&D. As such, we expect an increase in our effective cash tax rate and related cash taxes in fiscal 2025. Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 22%, up from 17% in fiscal 2024. We expect the cash tax rate to stabilize in the low 20s going forward. With incremental cash taxes factored in, we expect free cash flow to be between $386 million to $398 million or 23.5% to 24% of revenue. The anticipated free cash flow impact from cash taxes is approximately $110 million, or 7% of revenue, up from $81 million, or 6% of revenue, in fiscal 2024. Excluding cash taxes, pre-tax free cash flow is expected to be between 30% and 30.5%, up 50 basis points from fiscal 2024 at the high end of the range. As a helpful reminder for your modeling, due to seasonality and variability in billings, we expect significantly higher free cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and significantly lower free cash flow in the second and third quarters. Looking now at Q1. We expect total revenue to be between $391 million and $393 million or 18% to 19% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $374 million and $376 million, up 19% year over year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $105 million and $108 million or 27% to 27.5% of revenue. Lastly, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30 per diluted share, based on a share count of approximately 301 million to 302 million shares. In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 performance. We are balancing conviction in our long-term opportunity with near-term prudence as we evolve our go-to-market to drive customer adoption and support our growing pipeline of large competitive displacement opportunities. We have a strong track record of consistent execution. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to optimizing costs, improving efficiency and profitability. At the same time, we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the Q4. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of these large deals that you landed in Q4, you know, a nine-figure TCV deal, an eight-figure land deal. Sort of reaffirms what you guys have been telling us the last couple of quarters that there's a lot of these large strategic deals in the pipeline, and it looks like you guys got to close a healthy amount of them in Q4. Rick, I was wondering if you want to put the go-to-market changes that you have planned for the early part of the year in the context of the success you're seeing with these large enterprise deals, should I take the go-to-market changes, meaning that you're kind of focused more down market and other customer segments, or you just need more sort of sales capacity to close more volume of deals? Given the success that we've seen landing in Q4, I'd love to just better understand the rationale for some of these go-to-market changes that you have planned for the first half. Thank you.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Sanjit. The short-form answer is that we're seeing increased momentum, increased traction, increased centralization of the end-to-end observability and broad-based observability architecture decisions. And the result of that is that's where you focus your sales energy. So, in the go-to-market evolution, our focus on things like customer segmentation and partners really to address that end-to-end observability architecture approach is very consistent with what we're seeing in the market. And that's the bet that we're making heading into FY '25.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. The only other thing I'd add to that is, Sanjit, it's actually providing more resource at the top of the pyramid. So, if you think about the Global 500, the propensity for spend there is significantly higher than those customers that are below that. So, we are weighting more resource at the higher end of the pyramid. So, that's primarily what we're doing, and it's in line with what Rick outlined, which is more end-to-end observability decisions tend to occur with very large enterprise customers where our value proposition really thrives.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It was great to see the validation of the thesis. And 18 anchor deals closed in Q4, greater than $1 million, so seven-figure ACV deals, very, very strong performance.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah, I know, very impressive. As a follow-up and just in terms of what sort of underpins the guidance, it's certainly not you're assuming any sort of improvement in outlook. If you look at some of the things that could drive upside to your guidance, you know, what would be some of the swing factors, if you will, that could get the ARR, you know, north of the 15% guidance?Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Sanjit. I'll take that. That's a good question that as we outlined kind of as a context for the guidance, we did suggest that, hey, we think the macro environment is not going to improve. It's not going to worsen. Customers are still leveraging observability as a priority. We did outline that we do expect this trend of architecture for observability decisions to continue. And as we outlined around some of these go-to-market enhancements, what we're doing is we're building in some prudence. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that roughly 30% of our accounts are going to have a new rep. That's already taking place. So, this is not like it's going to change throughout the year, but we've changed accounts per rep. We know, at times, that can result in some near-term disruption. We've tried to factor that in. So, to answer your question directly, to the extent we can minimize that, to the extent some of these larger deals, the timing of them occurs faster, I think those would be two factors that would drive improvement to this guide.Sanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Very clear, Jim. Thank you so much.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi. Thank you very much. One question for Rick and one for Jim. So, Rick, clearly, the move up market is working. You're landing big deals, very strategic engagements. And that's great. But it does look like the net expansion rate on a trailing 12-month basis came down. So, wondering if you could talk about the other side of the fence, the mid-market business and what's happening there and what could happen there? And one for you, Jim. It looks like net new ARR -- first of all, I got to tell you that you guys are one of the very few that disclose net new ARR. So, thanks for the transparency. The year was down but the quarter was up. Trend is getting better, right? If this trend holds, notwithstanding the changes to the field organization, what does that do to the guidance? Thank you so much.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Let me take the first one, Kash. So, relative to the net new ARR, in particular, the question around mid-market, the strategy around mid-market is really partners. We talk about that a lot. We are definitely leaned in relative to GSIs and hyperscalers, and that is really how we would expect to attack the mid-market space, which is through that avenue. Jim, on the second piece.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, relative to the net new ARR, one of the things, you are right, that if you look at the guide, this guide would suggest a slight moderation in net new ARR for the year for fiscal '25. As I mentioned to Sanjit, I think there are factors that could drive improvement to that. We actually felt that it was important to start with a guide that we thought reflected some prudence given some of the changes that we outlined. I would tell you, as you know, just from a seasonality perspective, the other thing we included in the prepared remarks is you should expect the net new ARR, call it, seasonality to be similar to what it was in fiscal '24, which is lighter in the first half and heavier in the second half, in Q1, in particular. Because it's the first quarter of the year, Q1 is seasonally our lightest quarter. So --Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Jim, you went through that. That was crystal clear. Absolutely. Appreciate that. But, Rick, on the mid-market, what's happening in the mid-market? So, why couldn't net expansion rates be back to the 118, 119 that they were, versus the 111? Looks like the swing factor is really mid-market because the large enterprise is doing really, really well. Thank you so much. I appreciate your patience.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I would say again that partners really are going to drive the mid-market for us, especially hyperscalers. If you get more granular, Kash, we would expect GSIs to be headed up market, if anything. You look at the nine-digit TCV Accenture deal with a large global financial institution, that's the kind of thing that we're going to see out of GSIs. Hyperscaler engagements, we announced the partnership -- go-to-market partnership with GCP in the past quarter as well. Those are the elements that will likely drive NRR in the mid-market.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. A couple from me. I wanted to ask or go back to the record 18 seven-figure deals and wanted to ask how often was Grail a part of those big deals? And when speaking about consolidation, was a part of that logs on Grail replacing incumbent vendors?Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yes and yes. Grail is part of essentially every SaaS deal that we do at this point. So, Grail, remember, is not equal to logs. Grail is underlying massively parallel processing data store for enormous amounts of data that can be accessed to store all sorts of different data types, logs, traces, metrics, etc. Logs access Grail, and logs are a key element of this end-to-end observability architecture approach. What customers are finding is that the log element really should not be viewed as an independent data type or an independent avenue for things like root cause analysis. They instead want to incorporate all data types into one universal observability orientation. It drives better user experience. It drives lower cost. It drives better outcomes. And so, logs on Grail are very typically part of the Grail deployments.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. No, thank you for that. And maybe a follow-up for Jim here. In the past, you said that, internally, the company thinks of the business as a Rule of 50-type business, 20% plus ARR growth, with the remainder coming from pre-tax free cash flow. And so, looking at the guide today, a bit shy of that target. You know, appreciate all the commentary on why the guidance is starting the way that it is. But it does sound like, you know, when you're looking at the Rule of 50-type business profile, it's mostly falling short from the AAR growth side of the equation. And so, how do you view the shape of ARR growth over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months to achieve that target, or are you thinking about that target a bit differently now? Thank you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer No, you're -- it's a great question, Koji. We still do view very much internally this Rule of 50. You're absolutely right. We've done a fantastic job driving leverage in the model with 30% pre-tax free cash flow margins. So, the guide would suggest we're going to be a bit below that for fiscal '25. You can certainly imagine that we're driving the business to a better outcome on the top line. So, that's -- that is certainly our ambition. And the changes that we're making on the go-to-market side that Rick outlined, we know those changes may take a little while to kind of mature, but those are the changes that we believe will lead to acceleration in ARR growth. And so, which -- that will be the driver of getting us back to Rule of 50.Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you for taking the questions.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor Relations Keith, are you there?Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Keith.OperatorI'm sorry.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. [Technical difficukty] for taking the question. I wanted to direct my first question on the why. And what I mean by that is if we take -- the feedback that we get from channel, it's pretty universally that Dynatrace has leading technology, particularly with the advent of Grail. And yet, if I look at the trend from '22, '23, '24, and what you're guiding to for '25, there's a steady erosion of growth, particularly if I focus on net new. And while I appreciate you've made some comments on there are some changes to go-to-market and whatnot, this has been an ongoing trend, and I'm just trying to maybe tease out the why a little bit more about the deceleration, particularly in light of if I superimpose our views of what security and logs are doing, it suggests the legacy or core, if you will, is having a more meaningful deceleration. And I'm just trying to understand why because the elongation of deal cycles, you would think that that anniversaries at some point in time. So, it's hard to reconcile that with the amount of deceleration that you're demonstrating. And, you know, is it because the underlying market of APM is slowing down, or is it the fact that you guys are focused on the largest customers, so perhaps bend is tighter there? Just, you know, really trying to understand not just what this quarter is, which was an excellent quarter, but really what's the trend over the last couple of years and why is there such significant slowdown and deceleration because it doesn't seem that go-to-market fully explains it.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I could start with that, and, Rick, you can offer. So, one, I'd remind you -- excuse me, that the time frame that you're talking about is a time frame where the macro environment worsened materially. So, a moderation in growth rates. Look at anyone in the software sector. That generally has affected all software companies. So, that is not unique to Dynatrace. So, I would say the growth moderation is not an anomaly. I would concur that, you know, the -- this guide specifically for fiscal '25 is prudent. I think we are building changes for the company for the long term. We've not abandoned the land-and-expand model at all. So, that's still a predominant motion. But we do believe, in order to get the penetration and growth that we need, an adjustment to the go-to-market model was needed. We needed to get more weighting of resources to higher propensity to spend customers. And these customers are the customers that are offering -- it's a sweet spot for them. Our value proposition is really oriented to very enterprise-oriented, complex environment companies. Ensuring we had the right focus there is what we needed to adjust. That is largely the driver. So, these changes that we're making, we think, are focusing on the right profile of customers for the value proposition that we provide and that, once we navigate through this, will lead to a reacceleration.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Keith, I would simply add that we've gone through a platform transition really to Grail, number one. Number two, we've gone through a go-to-market transition. So, there have been a couple of transitions amid this macro environment that Jim described as well. And as we think about these trends toward end-to-end observability architecture decisions that play to our favor, combined with the strength of Grail, the strength of the platform underlying it, along with these go-to-market changes to take advantage of this market trend, we're very optimistic as we look to the future.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. OK. Terrific. And, Jim, maybe I'll just direct my follow-on question, which relates to that. You indicated that the $100 million targets that you had previously anticipated for '25 are pushing into '26. Was that for both security and for logs? And what -- you know, which -- in past conversations, I think you had some more optimism, if you will, around logs. But maybe if you could just tease out a little bit why those are being pushed out, and did I hear you correctly that sort of both are pushing into '26?Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, you did. So, I'll start with we're making very good traction with both of those. So, both areas, we have 600-plus customers leveraging either our application security solution and 600 on the log side. So, we're getting good traction. I would say, on the adoption side, I've always said, on logs, in particular, that the adoption would take a while and that there would be a requirement for an uptick in the back half of fiscal '25. Again, we still have confidence. And so, the market is still good for those offerings. I think our competitive differentiation is still compelling. So, I think they will be $100 million-plus businesses. We just wanted to be open that we think that that might extend. And the reason is, as we see a growing trend of these end-to-end observability decisions from customers, what we have found, and it's still early days, is they sequence what they deploy. And when they sequence what they deploy, sometimes they're deploying application observability, infrastructure monitoring, things of that nature first. And logs and application security are like on their road map, but those are, call it -- those are following. And so, the adoption of those areas, we believe, are probably going to push a little bit. So, we think these businesses will still be $100 million-plus businesses. We do think this trend of what we're seeing with platform consolidation will change the sequencing and adoption of some of these new emerging areas.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Terrific. Many thanks for taking the questions.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would also just add, the increase in number of log customers to 600, which is up 30% quarter-over-quarter, increase -- similar increase in the number of AppSec customers. So, we continue to see traction and continue to see deployment in these core areas, with substantial growth in consumption.Keith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. OK. Terrific. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Thank you. As we -- as you guys kind of pursue these larger ideals, obviously, there's only like a few -- like can you talk a little bit about, like, the changes in the vendor landscape that you kind of dealing with then? Is that like a consolidation of tools? Are you replacing things? And then on the replacement side, there's obviously then just one big one that comes to mind, but that kind of seem to have locked in a lot of their customers on kind of renewals. Can you talk a little bit about the timing then that we could see here in terms of like getting some and then kind of the building momentum on the larger deal size? Thank you.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Raimo, the landscape is evolving, as I mentioned earlier, really toward an increased view toward centralization of the overall landscape and decisions associated with observability. What we saw, for example, in the large airline example that we provided in our prepared remarks, was they felt they were spending too much money to get too little user experience and too many incidents. By consolidating multiple different vendors together, they thought they would improve user experience, reduce cost, and dramatically reduce the number of incidents. And this is the trend that we're seeing. There are, frankly, just very few vendors in the space that can provide this solution to that landscape orientation, and Dynatrace is a core among them.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Yeah. OK. Perfect. And then the -- for Jim, like in the previous quarters, you talked a little bit about the needs for investments, etc., and you were one of the first to point out that I need to pre-invest into sales capacity, etc. If I look at the guidance and the numbers now, it actually looks like you're kind of managing to kind of still show us good profitability levels and still seem to invest well. Can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives you're doing there to achieve that? Thank you and congrats from me as well.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer You're right, Raimo, that, you know, one of the things you've always gotten with Dynatrace is a commitment to continue to try to drive leverage and drive balance, you know, as evidenced by what is almost 300 basis points of operating margin expansion this year, 200 basis points of free cash flow. We're going to -- we are continuing to drive scale across the business. So, you saw leverage in G&A. You should expect to see more leverage in G&A. These things we're doing around cloud hosting costs, where, potentially, we can drive some modest leverage in gross margin. So, I would say, it's multiple and it's, call it, modest in areas, but it adds up. The areas that we are making very specific investments are we are making very specific investments in R&D. We expect R&D to actually, as a percent of revenue, to grow in fiscal '25. We do think on the sales and marketing side, we will see a little bit of leverage. Some of that leverage will come from to Rick's opening point about partners and driving more through partners. But I do want to make it clear, we are also going to make incremental sales rep investments in fiscal '25. So, there will be investments in sales capacity, in addition to kind of getting better partner leverage and productivity. So, it's a bunch of different areas, and what we're committed to is to stabilize and/or expand margins for the business.Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hey. It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. So, on the partner side, sounds again like great contribution for partners on those large seven-figure deals. You talked to some whitespace around new logos for partners in the prepared remarks. Just wondering what maybe can you do to help the origination side of the equation for partners.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the whole purpose of driving partners is really for that origination. We already have a very substantial percentage of partner-influenced deals. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, over two-thirds of deals are already partner-influenced, so we are deeply engaged with the partner community already. The real thrust around our partner initiatives is to drive that 30% origination higher, which is precisely what we're doing with the GSIs and the hyperscalers. So, that is the major thrust of our partner strategy.Dan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Good morning. I know you mentioned that the changes in the sales force changing up 30% of your logos. I guess, have you done this in the past and what have you seen? And effectively, what are you trying to achieve? It seems like a pretty big change in the go-to-market. So, I'm just curious if you could double-click on what you expect to achieve through this.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, I'll take that. So, every year, there is some modest level of account movement. So, that's, call it, not unique. I'd say it is -- what is unique is having 30% of your accounts now kind of move to a new rep. But just to be clear, again, one of the things that we're doing is the sweet spot for Dynatrace is in very large enterprise environments. And when we looked at the resource coverage that we had in the Global 500, we felt we needed to weight more investment there. We needed more sales capacity there, that the number of accounts per rep and that part of the kind of coverage pyramid was not the density that we wanted. So, we are making more investments. Some of that investment is just reallocating investments from, call it, the mid-commercial to the strategic global accounts. Obviously, the whole point of this is those customers have a greater propensity to spend. The more we can do to get better coverage with them, the more -- I would say the more intimacy and the more penetration we can get for their spend. And so, the whole point of it is to drive more dedication of observability spend to Dynatrace with those customers and also garner some new logos in that space that we don't have today. So, that's really the focus. And then to Rick's point, it's also leveraging partners kind of in the broader ecosystem. And certainly, at the bottom end of the pyramid, it's an inside sales motion, which we've had in the past, but adding more capacity there with an inside sales motion. But all of these changes are designed to drive better productivity and to drive an acceleration in bookings and ultimately ARR growth.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. And I think maybe just tying back to the guide, these actions are accounting for the deceleration you're seeing despite all the hyperscalers seeing accelerating growth and growth that's --Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst You know, anywhere between high teens to 40%-plus.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I would say what we're doing is we're trying to build some prudence that when you make go-to-market changes like this, we're mindful that, sometimes, these changes can cause reps to pause. You have reps that are learning new accounts, reps that are building relationships, things of that nature, and that we are trying to build in some prudence that there may be some near-term impact from this account movement. As I said, I think it was to Sanjit, what could allow us to do better is if we -- if -- as we transition through this, if this disruption that we're modeling doesn't occur, then we could deliver a better outcome. And that's certainly what we're striving to do.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just, Jim, for you. I wanted to unpack the dollar-based net retention rate performance in the quarter. I know macro hasn't necessarily gotten worse, but I was hoping you could speak to some of the puts and takes on that heading 111% or a two-point sequential deceleration in the quarter. And if you can paint a pathway for us as to the time and slope of a reexpansion in this metric, especially when I, you know, superimpose some of your commentary around how successful the consumption trends under the DPS selling vehicle are going. So, I was hoping you could bridge the gap for us in terms of some of the lightness and the compression this quarter and how we can get back to a path toward, you know, your historical 120% levels. And a quick follow-up, please.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Right. So, that I'd say you're right, that the NRR was at -- was just -- it was -- you know, I'd say it rounded down from 112 to 111. So, a little bit lighter. But I think that's largely driven by the fact that, you know, we had a very, very strong new logo quarter. And so, sometimes, you have quarters where new logos are stronger than expansions. We had a very good new logo quarter. You did highlight some important things to make sure we comment on is DPS as a vehicle, it's still early days, making good traction, 18% of our customers. Now, call it 30-plus percent of our ARR. The fact that these customers are consuming faster is a -- think of it as a leading indicator. It is a leading indicator that if they consume faster, it means they're getting more value out of the platform. It means they're consuming at a faster rate, which means that is a leading indicator of future expansion. We're relatively early days with DPS, so you think of the cohorts that we have that we've only been at it for a year. And so, it will take a little bit of time for this to manifest itself in expansion and in NRR, but that is the expectation. And the leading indicator we're seeing is DPS as a contracting vehicle is doing exactly what we thought, which is it allows customers to access the platform without committed SKU-based items that they are dollar-based commitment. They're leveraging as much of the platform. They have an ability to leverage all the product capabilities. The fact that they're consuming at a rapid rate means that we believe that you will see an earlier expansion that otherwise would have occurred under a SKU-based model. Will we -- I think we will see some of that in fiscal '25. But I think, you know, exiting fiscal '25 is when you'll see even more of that.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst I appreciate that. And just on the point of new logo and new logo growth, I know, historically, you've talked about an algorithm between acquiring the logos and, you know, going down the expansion path with your very loyal and very large customers who, you know, have that propensity to spend. But I'm curious if you can please comment on how you're thinking about the new logo trajectory in fiscal '25 in the context of, you know, rebalancing some of your sales capacity resources and, you know, straddling the quality versus the quantity dynamic of a new logo acquisition. Thank you.Jim Benson -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a great question. I would say the model hasn't fundamentally changed as far as, you know, that I'd say, today, of our ARR, 40% of our ARR roughly comes from new logos, 60% from expansion. That's not going to change fundamentally. Your comment about quantity versus quality of we are very focused on the quality. I'm not as focused on the quantity. What we have found is that if we land customers at greater than 100K of ARR, they expand much faster. Obviously, what you've seen is this growing trend of architecture decisions. You're going to have some quarters, like we had in the fourth quarter, where you're overweighted in that area, and they're very, very, very, very large. So, I'd say we're focused more on the quality of the land. Some of these go-to-market changes that we've outlined, I think, are again geared toward more quantity. A little bit in the mid-market, but I'd say it's primarily quality. And so, the, call it, the equation we think about is, call it, roughly 40% of the ARR coming from new, 60% from expansion. And I think that's probably going to continue.Fatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you so much.Rick McConnell -- Chief Executive Officer All right. Well, thank you all for your questions and ongoing support. We saw Q4 as a very strong finish to fiscal 2024 and establishing momentum as we head into the new fiscal year. We are quite bullish about the opportunity for end-to-end observability decisions to come. We look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Noelle Faris -- Vice President, Investor RelationsRick McConnell -- Chief Executive OfficerJim Benson -- Chief Financial OfficerSanjit Singh -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystKoji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystKeith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- AnalystRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- AnalystDan Bergstrom -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- AnalystFatima Boolani -- Citi -- Analyst\n",

My name is Mark, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the monday.com first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Stephen, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.Byron Stephen -- Vice President, Investor Relations Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss the financial results for monday.com's first quarter fiscal year 2024. Joining me today are Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, co-CEOs of monday.com; and Eliran Glazer, monday.com's CFO. We released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 earlier today. You can find our quarterly shareholder letter along with our investor presentation and a replay of today's webcast under the news and events section of our IR website at ir.monday.com. Certain statements made on the call today will be forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on the currently available information. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Please refer to our earnings release for more information on the specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on the call today.Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the earnings release and the earnings presentation for today's call, which are posted on the investor relations website. Now, let me turn the call over to Roy. Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Byron, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Following an exceptional year of growth and progress, we are thrilled to report that 2024 is off to another strong start. In the first quarter, monday.com showcased outstanding business and financial performance, highlighted by increasing adoption of our new products, robust revenue growth, and record-level free cash flow. Underlying product demand remained strong across all business segments. Despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, customers continued to build on the Work OS platform due to our ability to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and drive efficiency, ultimately empowering organizations to adapt and thrive in challenging environments. One of the key drivers behind our remarkable Q1 performance was the adjustments made to our pricing model. As a reminder, our pricing model structure is being rolled out in waves. For new monday customers and those billed monthly, new pricing took effect in Q1, while other customers will see updated pricing upon renewal. So far, the results from our new pricing structure have exceeded our initial projections, underscoring the strong value proposition of our products. We are particularly pleased with the initial churn data. Overall gross retention reached an all-time high in Q1, continuing its upward momentum over the past year. Let me now turn it over to Eran to walk you through some of our product highlights.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Roy. In Q1, our vision of becoming the go-to work platform for businesses took a significant step forward with the opening of monday sales CRM and monday dev to all customers. The response has been incredibly positive with both products showing accelerating account growth in Q1. In addition, we remain on schedule to launch the new monday service product in late 2024. Looking ahead, we are committed to further investment and promotion of all our current and upcoming products to address the needs of customers of all types and sizes. Our mission, to empower anyone with the ability to harness AI, continues to make progress. Building upon a successful launch of our AI system, we recently introduced enhanced AI capabilities, including AI automations, smart columns, and AI-powered templates. These new features enable customers to leverage the power of AI throughout our Work OS platform, unlocking significant business value and seamlessly integrating AI into their daily workflows. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to driving growth at scale, delivering value to our customers and shaping the future of work through innovation and excellence. Our focus on product innovation, customer success, and operational efficiency will continue to drive momentum and position us for success in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn it over to Eliran to cover our financials and guidance.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Eran, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Today, I'll review our first quarter fiscal 2024 results in detail and provide updated guidance. Fiscal year '24 is off to another strong start. Total revenue in Q1 '24 came in at 216.9 million, up 34% from the year-ago quarter. Our overall net dollar retention rate was stable in Q1 '24 at 110%, reflecting the recent pricing updates and strong down-market demand for our Work operating system products. We currently anticipate a reported MDR to remain stable throughout fiscal year '24 with an expected small improvements by the end of the year. As a reminder, our net dollar retention is a trailing four quarter weighted average calculation. In Q1, we updated our list prices to better align with the increased value provided by our Work OS platform and product suite to our customers. These adjustments have outperformed our initial forecast, and we now anticipate they would generate approximately $25 million in revenue for fiscal year 2024. For the reminder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, I will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First quarter gross margin was 90%. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high 80s range. Research and development expense was 34.8 million in Q1 '24, or 16% of revenue, compared to 18% in Q1 '23. Sales and marketing expense was 120.8 million in Q1 '24, or 56% of revenue, compared to 63% in Q1 '23. G&A expense was 17.6 million in Q1 '24, or 8% of revenue, compared to 10% in Q1 '23. Net income was 31.7 million in Q1 '24, up from 7.2 million in Q1 '23. Diluted net income per share was $0.61 in Q1 '24, based on 52 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Total employee headcount was 1,987, an increase of 133 employees since Q4 '23. We expect to ramp throughout fiscal year '24, with continued focus on our R&D, product and sales teams as we build out our platform and product suite. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with 1.22 billion in cash and cash equivalents up from 1.12 billion at the end of Q4 '23. In Q1 '24, free cash flow was a record of 89.9 million, and free cash flow margin as defined as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 41%. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities, less cash used for property and equipment and capitalized software costs, excluding nonrecurring items. Now, let's turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 226 million to 230 million, representing growth of 29% to 31% year over year. We expect non-GAAP operating income of 17 million to 21 million and an operating margin of 8% to 9%. We expect free cash flow of 47 million to 51 million and free cash flow margin of 21% to 22%. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of 942 million to 948 million, representing growth of 29% to 30% year over year.

We expect full year free cash flow of 238 million to 244 million and free cash flow margin of 25% to 26%. I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Great. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a pretty solid quarter here. I want to ask you on the CRM and dev side, the traction there is palpable. It seems like you're adding more CRM and dev accounts in Q1, more than that of Q4 or even a year ago that's in a very tough SMB environment. Help us understand what is driving that. Are people kind of consolidating on monday for these functional use cases, saving them money overall? Are these accounts new accounts largely? Or are you seeing existing accounts at CRM and dev? And how should we think about the contribution for these products for this year?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Pinjalim. This is Eran. So, yeah, we see great traction both for our CRM product and dev product. I think it's a combination of -- you know, traditionally, Q1 is a strong quarter for us in terms of customer acquisition. So, I think that drove some of the increase in terms of net new customers. In addition to that, the products are open to all customers. So, we've seen more cross-sell from existing customers. I would say that in both of monday dev and monday CRM, we're also climbing and acquiring larger and larger customers over time. So, obviously a lot of SMBs, and we see still strong demand from SMBs across all products, but also adding more features and functionality. Over time, we'll be able to bring larger and larger customers to use those products. So, I think it's a combination of multiple factors, but overall, we're very happy with the progress with both of those products and the traction we see from our customers.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Yep, understood. One question for Eliran. Sorry, were you saying something?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. Go ahead, Pinjalim.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Another question for Eliran. Eliran, you took up the pricing assumption. Trying to understand from the new customers, did you see any kind of a benefit from pricing in Q1? I'm trying to understand the NDR commentary. I think last time you said that the NDR will uptick in the second half. Now, it seems like you're talking about more of a small uptick at the end of the year. But pricing seems like it's doing well. I'm trying to understand if -- and you're taking the overall guidance up and flowing through the beat for Q1. So, I'm trying to understand the NDR commentary versus kind of the pricing benefits you're seeing.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Pinjalim, sure. It's Eliran. So, just maybe to mention that the majority of the NDR improvement for fiscal year '24 is related to pricing. And because we initiated the new pricing in February, it was mostly for the monthly ones that actually benefit from the price increase. The rest of the annual contracts are going to be 12 -- throughout 2024. So, we believe that still you have to be seeing what would be the impact as these customers continue to renew the annual subscribers. So, that is why we kind of took an approach with regards to the NDR. Potentially the uptick is going to be later throughout this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning here. I wanted to start out with the improvement you saw in gross retention despite a pretty challenging macro here and some of the pricing updates. What's driving the improvement in retention given some challenges that you typically expect here? Is it just tied to some of these workflows that you're embedded that people are seeing good value out of? Walk me through the improvement in your retention that you're seeing and what's driving that. Thanks.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Brent, it's Eliran. So, there are a few reasons for the improvement. One is we continue to go upmarket with larger accounts, larger customers. So, this is a more stabilized kind of customers with a better profile. The second thing I would assume that the price increase that we did potentially the customers that used to be the ones that did not decide they would like to continue to be customers of monday probably churned and we remained, with again a better customer on the platform. The third thing is what Eran mentioned earlier. I believe that the new products that we launched, CRM, dev, are now -- continue to gain traction within existing customer base and therefore they contribute to the fact that we are more stabilized with our customers. So, I think all of the above is actually creating a better profile of the retention on monday platform.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Helpful color. And then, my quick follow-up here is around linearity. Just given the macro uncertainty, what was the linearity you saw in kind of the quarter? It sounds like Q2 is off to a pretty healthy start, too. So, any color on month-to-month linearity that surprised either way?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I think few comments. We believe that the current macro economy will remain choppy by the end of the year. You know, it doesn't mean that it's going to get any better, but it doesn't mean that it's going to get any worse. I think that we post our Q1 successful pricing adjustment. We have more confidence on the results that we presented when we did the investor day back in December, the best case scenario. So, all in all, in terms of linearity, we see a positive momentum throughout the year also, you know, impacted by strong performance and the price increase in Q1. You know, yet to be seen how it's going to be with the annual subscribers, but overall positive momentum throughout the year, and this is why we have increased guidance and improved margins.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Jackson Ader -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks for answering our questions, guys. The first one is maybe on customer acquisition costs, the non-GAAP sales and marketing tick-down in terms of the growth rate relative to the last couple of quarters. So, just curious what you're seeing in the performance marketing channel from some of your competitors, either up or down market?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hey, it's Roy. So, what we see in performance marketing, I think the most -- and the biggest influence in Q1 is that we always boost marketing spending Q1. It's like something we've done over the years and Q1 here wasn't different. But, also we do see more competition in some areas. Some have pulled in, then pulled back. So, I think it made us stay within the same boundaries we feel comfortable with. We didn't, you know, chase them or downgrade it, so there is slightly more competition this quarter than before.Jackson Ader -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. All right. Great. That makes sense. And then I'm curious on the CRM and the dev tools. Does one of them end up lending itself to better cross-sell or upsell with work management than the other?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I can take it. Hi Jackson, it's Eran. So, would you see any one of those tools perform better compared to the other one, both in terms of CRM and dev, we see good traction and customers adding more products over time. The same goes from work management itself. We see customers starting to use CRM and dev, let's say roughly the same ratio. So, we don't see any significant change. I will say that we're very encouraged from the fact customers are trying more products over time. And again, now the products are all out to the entire population and we have more opportunity to do cross-sell. And over time, we hope that we'll be able to land bigger and bigger deals in both of those products, like we've done with work management in the past.Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hey, I can add. It's Roy. We do see a different behavior within larger, smaller customers, whereas smaller customers tend to adopt more quickly other products and larger ones it requires like more time or effort.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Please go ahead.Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you guys and nice job here on a strong start to the year. Maybe if I can start with just the competitive environment. Certainly, you had really strong Q1 results. It seems like pricing is contributing to that, but core demand also seems strong. And what we're hearing from other software vendors is that the SMB market is certainly a little bit choppy. So, I'm curious how you're thinking of the shift in competitive dynamics in the industry. I think you've been taking share over the last several quarters, but when you look out at your competitors, how has behavior changed? Are customers consolidating more? Talk us through some of the trends that you are seeing that's enabling the growth here.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Sure. Hi, Arjun. It's Eran. So, maybe I will start with the SMBs. As you know, since we reported Monday, SMB continued to be a very strong segment. It's around 45% for total overall, and we continue to invest significantly in performance marketing always in Q1 alongside mid-market and enterprise to maintain this. In addition, I think that what we mentioned earlier, the new product are resonating well with SMB customers, both CRM and dev, together with the features and functionalities that we are introducing to the market. Also, we were encouraged by the fact that when we did the pricing adjustment. We didn't see a reaction that was overstated, but actually better than what we anticipated, so it's also kind of regained confidence in the SMB segment. And one thing that, you know, your peers you mentioned in terms of competition, our peers mentioned in the past that they are focusing more on SMB -- sorry, on upmarket enterprise accounts. And I think, which allows us to focus even more on SMBs and gain market share. So, all in all, in terms of competition, I feel we are in a very good place with regards to SMBs, and we have no major concerns, you know, versus the other players.Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair -- Analyst Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks, Eran. And then, the other one, you launched several new kind of AI capabilities. This quarter is -- I read about some of them in the shareholder letter. But when you think about the impact, I know it's still early, but the impact that AI is having in your customer base, I'm curious how you are seeing adoption and usage of those capabilities. And then, right around -- when you think out longer term, how much do you think these new capabilities are going to make it easier for users and customers to build on top of monday, and what do you think that does from just a user adoption as you think out over the next year or two here?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy. So, we just rolled out the initial phase of our AI building blocks, like we talked about in investor day. And we see great initial results from that, because people actually use it to build new workflows, and they really harness the power of AI to do a lot of stuff they would normally do themselves. Regarding to your questions about platform adoption, I think like AI plays two parts. One is giving people, our customers, more capabilities and making them stickier and increasing automations and a lot of things they can now do with the platform. But also adopt the platform itself and do a lot of like, let's say, harder tasks for them, like creating formulas, like building boards, connecting things, and also suggesting things they might do. So, that's like another direction we're always pushing toward. So yes on both. And like in the next year or so, we expect the adoption to increase dramatically and that our customer base will adopt all those capabilities.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hello. Thank you very much, Roy, Eran, and Eliran. Congratulations on the quarter. Very few companies have been able to put up the kind of numbers that you have in this Q1. So, really, kudos to you guys. My question is in regards to the move up market to the enterprise, I mean very, very few companies move this effectively and rapidly up market and maintain the performance. When I look at your 50K-plus customers, 100K-plus customers, the net new ARR growth is phenomenal. The revenue growth there is phenomenal, while you still continue to maintain your pace in the lower end of the market. So, the question is, what are the products that are being taken up by the larger enterprise customers? Are there deployment differences in what they are consuming and the potential for more revenue within the installed base because it just looks like it's just getting started in the up market motion. So, 50K, 100K, any changes you are making to go more deliberately and become a big player in this market? Also, one for Eliran, sorry, your net expansion rates in the 50K plus cohort look very solid. As your business really tilts more and more toward the 50K plus cohort, shouldn't this be an encouraging sign for overall net expansion rates improving for the company in the quarters ahead? Thank you so much.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, Kash. This is Eran. So, look, I think in terms of CRM and dev, it's mostly SMBs now. And I think with work management, we really were able to and it's a huge challenge, it's a greater product that is suitable for SMBs but also can scale for the enterprise customers. And we managed to do that. It was very focused effort from our side and very important for us and we actually -- this is how we built the company. So, we can hear the voice and the feedback from both the SMBs and the larger enterprises. And we're going to do and apply the same secret sauce to our CRM and dev products, because we understand how important it is, not just to scale up market, but also to keep that traction of our SMB customers. It's such an important funnel for us. So, basically, this is how we think about this new product and we're applying the same methodology that we've done to work management. And overall, having that product suite really helps also scale into the enterprise because they can use multiple products and deploy multiple products at the same time which really contributes toward our NDR in the larger customers. So, that's how we see it in terms of the multi-product.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer And maybe I will follow-up on Eran, Kash. Hi. To your next question. So, maybe just to add, we continue to invest in the platform itself and add more capabilities in order to support the scale of the enterprise customers. Just as a reminder, mondayDB is going to continue to develop and evolve again to help us scale with larger customers. We're adding additional features and functionalities like add-ons, all kinds of functionalities that will be more suitable for the enterprise customers that some of our peers already have. So, this is an area of investment. Now, to your question, we continue to go upmarket and what it means to us, so I think for us, Kash, we are consistent with the fact that we are saying. Look, we are servicing all of the segments. We care about SMBs, we care about the mid-market because we think there is a huge opportunity there, but we also want to make sure that we go upmarket because this is a more -- in terms of retention, stickiness and larger and larger deals, I think this is something that you would like also to see coming in the next few quarters. And I think this year, with the price increase and everything that we're introducing to the market by the end of the year after we roll out most of the price increase and to see what would be the reaction of the bigger and larger customers. We will have more confidence on and have better visibility on the future years. But, you know, this is a journey. So, currently the direction looks very good. But again, we have to see how it progress throughout the year.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Congrats, Eliran, on growth and free cash flow margins. That's phenomenal. Thank you so much, guys.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.DJ Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Hey, guys. I'll echo everyone else sentiments. Congrats, it's a great quarter. Eran, maybe I can start with you just in terms of progress with the development of the service product offering, things on track there. And I guess, broadly, anything you are seeing in the base in terms of usage patterns or any other observations that make to more or less confident in the direction of product development?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, DJ. This is Eran. So, yeah, we're very excited for all of this service. We're going to launch it toward the end of the year, end of 2024. We already have an alpha version. We are talking with a few customers that are now trying the product. And overall, like the reaction is very positive. I can also mention we -- I think we mentioned this briefly in the investor today, but there's a lot of demand from our customer base toward the monday service, a lot of excitement, and I can share that the initial feedback from customers is very encouraging, so really excited for this. But, you know, obviously, it's a new product. It's going to take time to gain traction and momentum. But like I said, we're very excited for the release of that. And I think that's another step toward our vision of managing the core of work. I feel that service, whether it's IT or HR requests or any other form of in-company ticketing system is such an important part of that vision. So, that's why we're very excited for that product release.DJ Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Yeah, it makes sense. And then, Eliran, a follow-up for you. I think last quarter you told us 20% of the basis monthly, 80% is annual. That 80% where the price increase is kind of coming on a rolling basis. Is there anything we should think about in terms of linearity of the renewal pool just in terms of tactically kind of where those price increases might impact the model as we look over the next four quarters?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, DJ, it's a great question actually. Yes. So, we believe we're going to complete the rollout of the new pricing for the annual subscribers by H1 of next year. So, think about the next 12 months from now because we introduced it on late February. Now, they are getting into -- upon renewal, we're going to see. So, probably the next 12 months to 15 months, this is when it's going to be completed.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Derrick Wood -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Great. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter guys. Last quarter, you guys talked about softness in late December and into January with less seed expansion and still some seed downgrades happening. Sounded like things got better through the quarter. Can you just comment on what you saw improve in February and March, and I guess since you're halfway through Q2 now, how demand trends have tracked quarter to date so far?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Derrick, I can start. This is Eran and if anyone wants to follow-up. Yeah, I think previous quarter we're just were starting the year, we were kind of rolling out the price increase and I think there was a lot of uncertainty about the fact of that, like we mentioned in the previous earnings call, it was the first time we ever raised prices for our customer base. I think what changed is two things. One, we thought that the price increase was -- the reception for that from our customer base was very positive. We were even encouraged by the feedback and overall we saw lower churn profile, less downgrades than we expected, and great feedback from customers. So, I think that was very encouraging. In addition to that, we saw a great demand from all segments, including SMB in Q1 and overall strong momentum in the business. And I think that would have to be more optimistic toward the end of the year and seeing great momentum, build it up throughout the year. I think that was fundamentally changed.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Maybe I will just add, this is Eliran, that, you know, the market is feeling consistent and choppy, but we feel like the momentum for us is relatively good and encouraged by what Eran said to the rest of the year.Derrick Wood -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Great. Maybe for Eliran, would you be able to quantify the benefit from price increases in the quarter? And remind us, I guess, you said $25 million tailwind this year. What was the previous assumption?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer The previous assumption was between 50 to 20. Just as a reminder, this is revenue. Revenue is the derivative of the ARL. If you take very, by and large, you get the ARL throughout the year. And the revenue is recognized on a monthly basis, this is something we increased the numbers. We feel now, this is the contribution of the price increase. Because much of the effect of the annual renewal is going to be either throughout the second part of the year or next year, because of the fact that you get one divided by 12 of these contracts when they are renewed. We feel the $25 million is a pretty solid number.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. It sounds like SMB is fine, so that was good to hear. I guess when you think about the upper end of the mid-market and large enterprise, can you just expand on what you are seeing? I know you are beginning to see some larger seed counts, some bigger enterprise spend. Are these enhancements to the underlying platform helping you scale up and when some of these larger enterprises can use a sense of what's happening there?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Brent. This is Eran. Definitely, in addition to the SMB segment, we continue to see good momentum with the larger enterprises. Obviously, we had that big deal that we announced two quarters ago, but we still see great deals built enough in the pipeline and hopefully will convert into more of such enterprise opportunities. But overall, the enterprise pipeline looks very healthy and hoping for more big deals like that coming up in 2024.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst When you think about the infrastructure that you are putting in, whether it's go-to-market, the platform scalability, just give us an example of what you are doing to get ready. I guess many have kind of cited, is this the same strategy that salesforce saw when they started small, went mid, went large, and ultimately large became bigger than small? Are you seeing something similar to their pathway? Or what's giving you confidence that you can make that move?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, so again, I don't know the details of what Salesforce has done, but we've been working very hard on our infrastructure to support it. Obviously, we've talked about mondayDB, but this needs to be a flagship project for us as a company and we continue to roll out minor versions and we have some major versions coming up. Also, we make a lot of improvements to the platform, not just in terms of features and functionality, but also in terms of security and governments and permissions. It's an ongoing work for us and we talk with customers consistently and keep improving the platform. And also, we improve our go-to-market and the way we navigate ourselves with the organization and reaching decision makers. So, all in all, if I could buy anything, everything I said, you know, working on the infrastructure, working on the product, working on the go-to-market, our sales team, and we're very optimistic in our ability to continue in scale in the enterprise segment.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.George Iwanyc -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. You continue to steadily add to your channel and partner programs. Can you give us some color on the impact that this is having on your deal pipeline and on the CRM and dev momentum as well?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thanks. This is Roy. So, yeah, we're very proud of the partner channels we have. We have great partners and we are continuing to add more. We are more like we are with the entire organization with the partners. We're also focused on going off-market and deepening what partners do with our customers, like more services, helping them scale, giving consultancy, and so on. Essentially supporting us in regions we don't have sales, but also in the regions we do operate ourselves. And we see that as a great thing going forward we invest more in.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Maybe just to add to what Roy said, you know, we have a robust partner network, now with over 180 channel partners with some of the top world SIs like Accenture, Hitachi, KPMG, and we're also building a lot of our SVs on our marketplace. So, this is an area of investment that will continue to generate ARR and potential opportunities for us.George Iwanyc -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst And, Eliran, maybe can you give us some color on how the international markets are behaving on a relative basis?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, George, for us it's pretty stable. If you think about our business, around 50% is coming from North America. I believe 62% coming from the U.S. and Canada. We are seeing very strong momentum in Europe and in places where we don't have sales organizations, we operate to your prior question with partners. The momentum is good and relatively stable in terms of international expansion.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Berg with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Michael Berg -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the success in the quarter. I wanted to ask what you feel is allowing you to see success in this choppy macro, in particular with SMBs. Is there anything in particular about your product or go-to-market or even just like the increased breadth of the offering now that's allowing you to see this incremental success relative to many of the other SMB software vendors in this market?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy here. So, we feel very strong with SMBs as we saw that -- because monday is the platform and you can do a lot of things with it. We see that they really rely on us in these times and kind of add more use cases and see the true value of the platform. And so, that's why we keep seeing that they are very stable throughout this last period, while we're also very strong in acquiring new ones. As everyone mentioned, we see less competition in general, because like other players have chosen to go upmarket. And we're really pushing on the performance marketing and really understanding how to reach those customers on a growing scale. So, it's a very good market for us.Michael Berg -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Makes sense. And then, one quick follow-up, free cash flow had a really nice performance in the quarter, and you raised that outlook fairly nicely for the rest of the year. Anything in particular driving the strength in free cash flow dynamics relative to where you were expecting the gain of the year?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. So, Michael, in terms of kind of the variance between free cash flow and operating profit, so I would say 50% is related to strong cash collection from the SMBs as we see strong, the top of funnel activity. The price uplift as a reminder, we -- it was mostly there, monthly ones on February and some upmarket contracts. Around 20% of this is related to interest income due to the healthy balance sheet that we have. And I would say around 30% is related to normal timing of expenses. Just as a reminder, we expect free cash flow margin to come down in Q2 due to seasonality as we pay bonuses. This is price increase -- sorry, salary increases are being paid in Q2, as well as the headcount that we hired in Q1 also going to be fully onboarded in Q2. But overall, we feel very comfortable with what we said. We generate $1 billion free cash flow over the period of 2023 to 2026 and striving to get the 25% annual free cash flow margin, as we said.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.Steve Enders -- Citi -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks for taking the question there and congrats on the results. Pretty impressive given the macro it seems like we're seeing out there. I just maybe just to start, I want to ask on the CRM side and now that that's kind of like fully rolled out or able to be sold into the base, how are we kind of viewing the opportunity to drive that and, you know, maybe potentially converting customers who are already using monday as a CRM into that solutions that like -- do you view that as kind of being the real bulk of the opportunity, or kind of like what are the catalyst to potentially convert some of those customers over into using the full blown CRM solution from you?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, Steve. This is Eran. So, I'll split the answer into two. I think with the smaller accounts, the SMBs, it's going to be easier. Some of them are not used the CRM so it was an easy adoption for us. The other, we're also working on a bunch of migration tools. So, I think for the smaller customers, we've seen faster adoption is going to be easier. For the larger ones, it's a bit more complicated. It's not just seen, we have another product we need to talk with the decision-makers. So, that's another thing we're working on, reaching different functions within the organization and doing more top-down selling to those accounts. Obviously, we also need to mature the price a little bit if you want to support it. So, I can say that we've seen, you know, already great cross sell from SMBs and over time we'll see more and more of the larger organizations adopting full blown CRM or monday dev.Steve Enders -- Citi -- Analyst OK, great. That's helpful context. And then, I guess maybe on the pricing side and, some of the customer behavior that you're seeing, I guess, maybe how is the -- is there a difference between maybe what you're hearing from or what you're seeing from the monthly customers versus some of the annuals, is there beginning to come up on renewal and now that you have a couple of months of data here?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, this is Eran again. So, yeah, overall, like we're very, the results are pretty solid. Like, we're very happy with the churn profile. We haven't seen, much increase in terms of churn. Same goes for downgrade. So, obviously, the monthlies are most impacted because they can make a decision to leave at any given time, basically. You know, we ran our own model, and we saw the results are even better than we expected. So, for us, it has a lot of confidence and we even expect the annual accounts to behave even in a better way because they're a little bit less price sensitive. So, all in all, in terms of churn, downgrade, we don't see any major impact. And we see accounts continue and upgrade their accounts, even the ones that obviously got their price increased. So, overall, very good from the results.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Michael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah, thank you for the question. Good to see reports of weakness where we're greatly exaggerated in the quarter, so happy to see that. A couple of questions, if I could. You know, so, first on competitive deals, where you do see them, love to get some insight from you on, whether or not you're winning more of the competitive deals and if you are what you think the differentiator is to drive success with those?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy here. So, I think like we see great traction within the competitors when we do compete on larger deals. We see that we're able to compete very well. And we are working hard on our roadmap to even close all gaps that we have against competitors. So, I think we're in a really great place with work management compared to competitors within the enterprise space. The CRM and dev, like Eran said, it's still early days compared to the other very large competitors out there. But we do see great traction more on the SMB side and compete on those fronts really well, SMB to small midmarket.Michael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. The second one is actually multi-part and relates to price and then insurance. So, first, how should we think about pricing going forward? Do you plan on having predictable annual price increases or will it be more ad hoc? Then as you do get more cross-sell, can you walk us through how either conceptually or quantitatively you think about that benefiting churn and then the two pieces together price and churn, how does that factor into the growth algorithm longer term?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, Mike, this is Eliran. With regards to price increase, we try to make sure that when we increase price, we do it based on value that we provide to our customers. We added a lot of value throughout the last few years and this is why we were only, for the first time, we increased the price for our existing customer base. So, I think, you know, we don't have a clear answer on which regards to what would be the annual yet, but I think overall we think it will be more tied to value-added, you know, value-adding rather than just having like you know the majority of it coming every year. The second thing which regards to cross-sell, so I think the combination of us opening the existing products of CRM, dev together with the work management to existing customers will allow us to see, you know, cross-sell opportunities with existing customer base and potentially with new customers, but it will take probably a few quarters to get a better understanding of the trend. I think once we have this packaging of the different products alongside the fact that we are introducing additional features and functionalities, cross-sell potentially is going to be, you know, with positive momentum, not necessarily having to be tied to a price increase.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Hi, everyone, a really nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. The customer accounts for CRM and dev are becoming meaningful at this point. How do you think about the types or size of customers that are actually buying that solution today? Are they still some of your smaller customers, you are seeing some adaption in some of the maybe mid or enterprise customers that you're selling the core platform to?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy. So, yeah, we do see CRM and dev play way more on the SMB and small midmarket rather than the larger customers we have. We do see very small, let's say, implementations within larger enterprises, but I think we have a very long roadmap on both products to reach those large enterprises' deployments on such products, if that helps.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Eliran, you mentioned before, contract terms have been pretty consistent. I believe it's 80% annual, 20% monthly. Are you seeing any real changes on that one way or the other? Historically, in times of maybe a little bit of economic pressure, customers will either switch to monthly or only bi-monthly up front to give some flexibility into their spending plans, just to know if you're seeing any changes there at all.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Scott. It's Eliran. No, I don't see any change to where we are now. Basically, we saw in the last few years -- actually, we saw a transition from monthly to annually. I think the 80%, 20% kind of by and large is something that is going to be very stable throughout the years, and I don't expect any material changes to that.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking my question.OperatorYour next question comes from the line up Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead.Taylor McGinnis -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for taking my question. My first one is just going back to the impact from price potentially in 1Q and maybe asked a different way. So, Eliran is it fair to assume that the up list would have contributed less than 6 million in 1Q, if the contribution should scale throughout the year? Just trying to understand how we think about that trajectory. When you provide that 25 million in uplift, just to clarify, is that the impact just from the install base or does that include the year-over-year impact from potentially higher new customer lands as well, too? Thank you.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Taylor. So, maybe we'll start with the second question. With regards to 25 million, this is taking into account potentially some scenarios that we did for existing and new customers, modeling all kinds of scenarios. So, this is taking everything into account. With regards to your first question, if I understood it correctly, I think the contribution to a strong performance was, I would say, half overall the business, the healthy type of funnel and the fact that we had good momentum with existing customers and half of it, I would say, was coming from the price increase. If the chain profile would have been worse than what we saw, potentially the numbers would have been lower. If I understood correctly what you asked.Taylor McGinnis -- UBS -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks so much. Then, my second question is that now with CRM widely available this year, it seems like that could be a big opportunity for you guys. I think if I look back last quarter, penetration of your total customer base was around 6%. So, I guess how would you just thinking about the trajectory of that business? Because it seems like this year could start to get to a, you know, scale that it could add a couple of points to growth. So, just out of the gate, would love to see -- would love just a little bit more color in terms of how you guys are thinking about penetration and the trajectory of that. Thanks.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Taylor. This is Eran. So, yeah, I totally agree. Like the cross sell-numbers, we're looking pretty solid and continue to perform really well. For us, it just feels like the beginning of taping into our existing customer base. Bear in mind that also for new customers, we encourage them to buy more than just one product when they sign up. So, there's a lot potential with new customers as well. We continue to promote the products in our platform and in our homepage. Overall, we're very happy with the rate of adoption of the new products. And like we mentioned, we also plan to continue and go up-market with our bigger customers. So, all in all, I think this presents a big opportunity for our existing customer base and also for our new customer.Operator[Operator instructions] There's no more question at this time.

My name is Mark, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the monday.com first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Stephen, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.Byron Stephen -- Vice President, Investor Relations Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss the financial results for monday.com's first quarter fiscal year 2024. Joining me today are Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, co-CEOs of monday.com; and Eliran Glazer, monday.com's CFO. We released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 earlier today. You can find our quarterly shareholder letter along with our investor presentation and a replay of today's webcast under the news and events section of our IR website at ir.monday.com. Certain statements made on the call today will be forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on the currently available information. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Please refer to our earnings release for more information on the specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on the call today.Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the earnings release and the earnings presentation for today's call, which are posted on the investor relations website. Now, let me turn the call over to Roy. Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Byron, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Following an exceptional year of growth and progress, we are thrilled to report that 2024 is off to another strong start. In the first quarter, monday.com showcased outstanding business and financial performance, highlighted by increasing adoption of our new products, robust revenue growth, and record-level free cash flow. Underlying product demand remained strong across all business segments. Despite lingering macroeconomic uncertainties, customers continued to build on the Work OS platform due to our ability to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and drive efficiency, ultimately empowering organizations to adapt and thrive in challenging environments. One of the key drivers behind our remarkable Q1 performance was the adjustments made to our pricing model. As a reminder, our pricing model structure is being rolled out in waves. For new monday customers and those billed monthly, new pricing took effect in Q1, while other customers will see updated pricing upon renewal. So far, the results from our new pricing structure have exceeded our initial projections, underscoring the strong value proposition of our products. We are particularly pleased with the initial churn data. Overall gross retention reached an all-time high in Q1, continuing its upward momentum over the past year. Let me now turn it over to Eran to walk you through some of our product highlights.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Roy. In Q1, our vision of becoming the go-to work platform for businesses took a significant step forward with the opening of monday sales CRM and monday dev to all customers. The response has been incredibly positive with both products showing accelerating account growth in Q1. In addition, we remain on schedule to launch the new monday service product in late 2024. Looking ahead, we are committed to further investment and promotion of all our current and upcoming products to address the needs of customers of all types and sizes. Our mission, to empower anyone with the ability to harness AI, continues to make progress. Building upon a successful launch of our AI system, we recently introduced enhanced AI capabilities, including AI automations, smart columns, and AI-powered templates. These new features enable customers to leverage the power of AI throughout our Work OS platform, unlocking significant business value and seamlessly integrating AI into their daily workflows. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to driving growth at scale, delivering value to our customers and shaping the future of work through innovation and excellence. Our focus on product innovation, customer success, and operational efficiency will continue to drive momentum and position us for success in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn it over to Eliran to cover our financials and guidance.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Eran, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Today, I'll review our first quarter fiscal 2024 results in detail and provide updated guidance. Fiscal year '24 is off to another strong start. Total revenue in Q1 '24 came in at 216.9 million, up 34% from the year-ago quarter. Our overall net dollar retention rate was stable in Q1 '24 at 110%, reflecting the recent pricing updates and strong down-market demand for our Work operating system products. We currently anticipate a reported MDR to remain stable throughout fiscal year '24 with an expected small improvements by the end of the year. As a reminder, our net dollar retention is a trailing four quarter weighted average calculation. In Q1, we updated our list prices to better align with the increased value provided by our Work OS platform and product suite to our customers. These adjustments have outperformed our initial forecast, and we now anticipate they would generate approximately $25 million in revenue for fiscal year 2024. For the reminder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, I will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First quarter gross margin was 90%. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high 80s range. Research and development expense was 34.8 million in Q1 '24, or 16% of revenue, compared to 18% in Q1 '23. Sales and marketing expense was 120.8 million in Q1 '24, or 56% of revenue, compared to 63% in Q1 '23. G&A expense was 17.6 million in Q1 '24, or 8% of revenue, compared to 10% in Q1 '23. Net income was 31.7 million in Q1 '24, up from 7.2 million in Q1 '23. Diluted net income per share was $0.61 in Q1 '24, based on 52 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Total employee headcount was 1,987, an increase of 133 employees since Q4 '23. We expect to ramp throughout fiscal year '24, with continued focus on our R&D, product and sales teams as we build out our platform and product suite. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with 1.22 billion in cash and cash equivalents up from 1.12 billion at the end of Q4 '23. In Q1 '24, free cash flow was a record of 89.9 million, and free cash flow margin as defined as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 41%. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities, less cash used for property and equipment and capitalized software costs, excluding nonrecurring items. Now, let's turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 226 million to 230 million, representing growth of 29% to 31% year over year. We expect non-GAAP operating income of 17 million to 21 million and an operating margin of 8% to 9%. We expect free cash flow of 47 million to 51 million and free cash flow margin of 21% to 22%. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of 942 million to 948 million, representing growth of 29% to 30% year over year. We expect full year non-GAAP operating income of 77 million to 83 million and an operating margin of 8% to 9%. We expect full year free cash flow of 238 million to 244 million and free cash flow margin of 25% to 26%. I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Great. Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a pretty solid quarter here. I want to ask you on the CRM and dev side, the traction there is palpable. It seems like you're adding more CRM and dev accounts in Q1, more than that of Q4 or even a year ago that's in a very tough SMB environment. Help us understand what is driving that. Are people kind of consolidating on monday for these functional use cases, saving them money overall? Are these accounts new accounts largely? Or are you seeing existing accounts at CRM and dev? And how should we think about the contribution for these products for this year?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Pinjalim. This is Eran. So, yeah, we see great traction both for our CRM product and dev product. I think it's a combination of -- you know, traditionally, Q1 is a strong quarter for us in terms of customer acquisition. So, I think that drove some of the increase in terms of net new customers. In addition to that, the products are open to all customers. So, we've seen more cross-sell from existing customers. I would say that in both of monday dev and monday CRM, we're also climbing and acquiring larger and larger customers over time. So, obviously a lot of SMBs, and we see still strong demand from SMBs across all products, but also adding more features and functionality. Over time, we'll be able to bring larger and larger customers to use those products. So, I think it's a combination of multiple factors, but overall, we're very happy with the progress with both of those products and the traction we see from our customers.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Yep, understood. One question for Eliran. Sorry, were you saying something?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. Go ahead, Pinjalim.Pinjalim Bora -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Another question for Eliran. Eliran, you took up the pricing assumption. Trying to understand from the new customers, did you see any kind of a benefit from pricing in Q1? I'm trying to understand the NDR commentary. I think last time you said that the NDR will uptick in the second half. Now, it seems like you're talking about more of a small uptick at the end of the year. But pricing seems like it's doing well. I'm trying to understand if -- and you're taking the overall guidance up and flowing through the beat for Q1. So, I'm trying to understand the NDR commentary versus kind of the pricing benefits you're seeing.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Pinjalim, sure. It's Eliran. So, just maybe to mention that the majority of the NDR improvement for fiscal year '24 is related to pricing. And because we initiated the new pricing in February, it was mostly for the monthly ones that actually benefit from the price increase. The rest of the annual contracts are going to be 12 -- throughout 2024. So, we believe that still you have to be seeing what would be the impact as these customers continue to renew the annual subscribers. So, that is why we kind of took an approach with regards to the NDR. Potentially the uptick is going to be later throughout this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning here. I wanted to start out with the improvement you saw in gross retention despite a pretty challenging macro here and some of the pricing updates. What's driving the improvement in retention given some challenges that you typically expect here? Is it just tied to some of these workflows that you're embedded that people are seeing good value out of? Walk me through the improvement in your retention that you're seeing and what's driving that. Thanks.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Brent, it's Eliran. So, there are a few reasons for the improvement. One is we continue to go upmarket with larger accounts, larger customers. So, this is a more stabilized kind of customers with a better profile. The second thing I would assume that the price increase that we did potentially the customers that used to be the ones that did not decide they would like to continue to be customers of monday probably churned and we remained, with again a better customer on the platform. The third thing is what Eran mentioned earlier. I believe that the new products that we launched, CRM, dev, are now -- continue to gain traction within existing customer base and therefore they contribute to the fact that we are more stabilized with our customers. So, I think all of the above is actually creating a better profile of the retention on monday platform.Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Helpful color. And then, my quick follow-up here is around linearity. Just given the macro uncertainty, what was the linearity you saw in kind of the quarter? It sounds like Q2 is off to a pretty healthy start, too. So, any color on month-to-month linearity that surprised either way?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, I think few comments. We believe that the current macro economy will remain choppy by the end of the year. You know, it doesn't mean that it's going to get any better, but it doesn't mean that it's going to get any worse. I think that we post our Q1 successful pricing adjustment. We have more confidence on the results that we presented when we did the investor day back in December, the best case scenario. So, all in all, in terms of linearity, we see a positive momentum throughout the year also, you know, impacted by strong performance and the price increase in Q1. You know, yet to be seen how it's going to be with the annual subscribers, but overall positive momentum throughout the year, and this is why we have increased guidance and improved margins.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Jackson Ader -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks for answering our questions, guys. The first one is maybe on customer acquisition costs, the non-GAAP sales and marketing tick-down in terms of the growth rate relative to the last couple of quarters. So, just curious what you're seeing in the performance marketing channel from some of your competitors, either up or down market?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hey, it's Roy. So, what we see in performance marketing, I think the most -- and the biggest influence in Q1 is that we always boost marketing spending Q1. It's like something we've done over the years and Q1 here wasn't different. But, also we do see more competition in some areas. Some have pulled in, then pulled back. So, I think it made us stay within the same boundaries we feel comfortable with. We didn't, you know, chase them or downgrade it, so there is slightly more competition this quarter than before.Jackson Ader -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. All right. Great. That makes sense. And then I'm curious on the CRM and the dev tools. Does one of them end up lending itself to better cross-sell or upsell with work management than the other?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I can take it. Hi Jackson, it's Eran. So, would you see any one of those tools perform better compared to the other one, both in terms of CRM and dev, we see good traction and customers adding more products over time. The same goes from work management itself. We see customers starting to use CRM and dev, let's say roughly the same ratio. So, we don't see any significant change. I will say that we're very encouraged from the fact customers are trying more products over time. And again, now the products are all out to the entire population and we have more opportunity to do cross-sell. And over time, we hope that we'll be able to land bigger and bigger deals in both of those products, like we've done with work management in the past.Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hey, I can add. It's Roy. We do see a different behavior within larger, smaller customers, whereas smaller customers tend to adopt more quickly other products and larger ones it requires like more time or effort.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Please go ahead.Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you guys and nice job here on a strong start to the year. Maybe if I can start with just the competitive environment. Certainly, you had really strong Q1 results. It seems like pricing is contributing to that, but core demand also seems strong. And what we're hearing from other software vendors is that the SMB market is certainly a little bit choppy. So, I'm curious how you're thinking of the shift in competitive dynamics in the industry. I think you've been taking share over the last several quarters, but when you look out at your competitors, how has behavior changed? Are customers consolidating more? Talk us through some of the trends that you are seeing that's enabling the growth here.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Sure. Hi, Arjun. It's Eran. So, maybe I will start with the SMBs. As you know, since we reported Monday, SMB continued to be a very strong segment. It's around 45% for total overall, and we continue to invest significantly in performance marketing always in Q1 alongside mid-market and enterprise to maintain this. In addition, I think that what we mentioned earlier, the new product are resonating well with SMB customers, both CRM and dev, together with the features and functionalities that we are introducing to the market. Also, we were encouraged by the fact that when we did the pricing adjustment. We didn't see a reaction that was overstated, but actually better than what we anticipated, so it's also kind of regained confidence in the SMB segment. And one thing that, you know, your peers you mentioned in terms of competition, our peers mentioned in the past that they are focusing more on SMB -- sorry, on upmarket enterprise accounts. And I think, which allows us to focus even more on SMBs and gain market share. So, all in all, in terms of competition, I feel we are in a very good place with regards to SMBs, and we have no major concerns, you know, versus the other players.Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair -- Analyst Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks, Eran. And then, the other one, you launched several new kind of AI capabilities. This quarter is -- I read about some of them in the shareholder letter. But when you think about the impact, I know it's still early, but the impact that AI is having in your customer base, I'm curious how you are seeing adoption and usage of those capabilities. And then, right around -- when you think out longer term, how much do you think these new capabilities are going to make it easier for users and customers to build on top of monday, and what do you think that does from just a user adoption as you think out over the next year or two here?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy. So, we just rolled out the initial phase of our AI building blocks, like we talked about in investor day. And we see great initial results from that, because people actually use it to build new workflows, and they really harness the power of AI to do a lot of stuff they would normally do themselves. Regarding to your questions about platform adoption, I think like AI plays two parts. One is giving people, our customers, more capabilities and making them stickier and increasing automations and a lot of things they can now do with the platform. But also adopt the platform itself and do a lot of like, let's say, harder tasks for them, like creating formulas, like building boards, connecting things, and also suggesting things they might do. So, that's like another direction we're always pushing toward. So yes on both. And like in the next year or so, we expect the adoption to increase dramatically and that our customer base will adopt all those capabilities.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hello. Thank you very much, Roy, Eran, and Eliran. Congratulations on the quarter. Very few companies have been able to put up the kind of numbers that you have in this Q1. So, really, kudos to you guys. My question is in regards to the move up market to the enterprise, I mean very, very few companies move this effectively and rapidly up market and maintain the performance. When I look at your 50K-plus customers, 100K-plus customers, the net new ARR growth is phenomenal. The revenue growth there is phenomenal, while you still continue to maintain your pace in the lower end of the market. So, the question is, what are the products that are being taken up by the larger enterprise customers? Are there deployment differences in what they are consuming and the potential for more revenue within the installed base because it just looks like it's just getting started in the up market motion. So, 50K, 100K, any changes you are making to go more deliberately and become a big player in this market? Also, one for Eliran, sorry, your net expansion rates in the 50K plus cohort look very solid. As your business really tilts more and more toward the 50K plus cohort, shouldn't this be an encouraging sign for overall net expansion rates improving for the company in the quarters ahead? Thank you so much.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, Kash. This is Eran. So, look, I think in terms of CRM and dev, it's mostly SMBs now. And I think with work management, we really were able to and it's a huge challenge, it's a greater product that is suitable for SMBs but also can scale for the enterprise customers. And we managed to do that. It was very focused effort from our side and very important for us and we actually -- this is how we built the company. So, we can hear the voice and the feedback from both the SMBs and the larger enterprises. And we're going to do and apply the same secret sauce to our CRM and dev products, because we understand how important it is, not just to scale up market, but also to keep that traction of our SMB customers. It's such an important funnel for us. So, basically, this is how we think about this new product and we're applying the same methodology that we've done to work management. And overall, having that product suite really helps also scale into the enterprise because they can use multiple products and deploy multiple products at the same time which really contributes toward our NDR in the larger customers. So, that's how we see it in terms of the multi-product.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer And maybe I will follow-up on Eran, Kash. Hi. To your next question. So, maybe just to add, we continue to invest in the platform itself and add more capabilities in order to support the scale of the enterprise customers. Just as a reminder, mondayDB is going to continue to develop and evolve again to help us scale with larger customers. We're adding additional features and functionalities like add-ons, all kinds of functionalities that will be more suitable for the enterprise customers that some of our peers already have. So, this is an area of investment. Now, to your question, we continue to go upmarket and what it means to us, so I think for us, Kash, we are consistent with the fact that we are saying. Look, we are servicing all of the segments. We care about SMBs, we care about the mid-market because we think there is a huge opportunity there, but we also want to make sure that we go upmarket because this is a more -- in terms of retention, stickiness and larger and larger deals, I think this is something that you would like also to see coming in the next few quarters. And I think this year, with the price increase and everything that we're introducing to the market by the end of the year after we roll out most of the price increase and to see what would be the reaction of the bigger and larger customers. We will have more confidence on and have better visibility on the future years. But, you know, this is a journey. So, currently the direction looks very good. But again, we have to see how it progress throughout the year.Kash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Congrats, Eliran, on growth and free cash flow margins. That's phenomenal. Thank you so much, guys.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.DJ Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Hey, guys. I'll echo everyone else sentiments. Congrats, it's a great quarter. Eran, maybe I can start with you just in terms of progress with the development of the service product offering, things on track there. And I guess, broadly, anything you are seeing in the base in terms of usage patterns or any other observations that make to more or less confident in the direction of product development?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, DJ. This is Eran. So, yeah, we're very excited for all of this service. We're going to launch it toward the end of the year, end of 2024. We already have an alpha version. We are talking with a few customers that are now trying the product. And overall, like the reaction is very positive. I can also mention we -- I think we mentioned this briefly in the investor today, but there's a lot of demand from our customer base toward the monday service, a lot of excitement, and I can share that the initial feedback from customers is very encouraging, so really excited for this. But, you know, obviously, it's a new product. It's going to take time to gain traction and momentum. But like I said, we're very excited for the release of that. And I think that's another step toward our vision of managing the core of work. I feel that service, whether it's IT or HR requests or any other form of in-company ticketing system is such an important part of that vision. So, that's why we're very excited for that product release.DJ Hynes -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Yeah, it makes sense. And then, Eliran, a follow-up for you. I think last quarter you told us 20% of the basis monthly, 80% is annual. That 80% where the price increase is kind of coming on a rolling basis. Is there anything we should think about in terms of linearity of the renewal pool just in terms of tactically kind of where those price increases might impact the model as we look over the next four quarters?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, DJ, it's a great question actually. Yes. So, we believe we're going to complete the rollout of the new pricing for the annual subscribers by H1 of next year. So, think about the next 12 months from now because we introduced it on late February. Now, they are getting into -- upon renewal, we're going to see. So, probably the next 12 months to 15 months, this is when it's going to be completed.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Derrick Wood -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Great. Thanks, and congrats on a good quarter guys. Last quarter, you guys talked about softness in late December and into January with less seed expansion and still some seed downgrades happening. Sounded like things got better through the quarter. Can you just comment on what you saw improve in February and March, and I guess since you're halfway through Q2 now, how demand trends have tracked quarter to date so far?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Derrick, I can start. This is Eran and if anyone wants to follow-up. Yeah, I think previous quarter we're just were starting the year, we were kind of rolling out the price increase and I think there was a lot of uncertainty about the fact of that, like we mentioned in the previous earnings call, it was the first time we ever raised prices for our customer base. I think what changed is two things. One, we thought that the price increase was -- the reception for that from our customer base was very positive. We were even encouraged by the feedback and overall we saw lower churn profile, less downgrades than we expected, and great feedback from customers. So, I think that was very encouraging. In addition to that, we saw a great demand from all segments, including SMB in Q1 and overall strong momentum in the business. And I think that would have to be more optimistic toward the end of the year and seeing great momentum, build it up throughout the year. I think that was fundamentally changed.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Maybe I will just add, this is Eliran, that, you know, the market is feeling consistent and choppy, but we feel like the momentum for us is relatively good and encouraged by what Eran said to the rest of the year.Derrick Wood -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Great. Maybe for Eliran, would you be able to quantify the benefit from price increases in the quarter? And remind us, I guess, you said $25 million tailwind this year. What was the previous assumption?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer The previous assumption was between 50 to 20. Just as a reminder, this is revenue. Revenue is the derivative of the ARL. If you take very, by and large, you get the ARL throughout the year. And the revenue is recognized on a monthly basis, this is something we increased the numbers. We feel now, this is the contribution of the price increase. Because much of the effect of the annual renewal is going to be either throughout the second part of the year or next year, because of the fact that you get one divided by 12 of these contracts when they are renewed. We feel the $25 million is a pretty solid number.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. It sounds like SMB is fine, so that was good to hear. I guess when you think about the upper end of the mid-market and large enterprise, can you just expand on what you are seeing? I know you are beginning to see some larger seed counts, some bigger enterprise spend. Are these enhancements to the underlying platform helping you scale up and when some of these larger enterprises can use a sense of what's happening there?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Brent. This is Eran. Definitely, in addition to the SMB segment, we continue to see good momentum with the larger enterprises. Obviously, we had that big deal that we announced two quarters ago, but we still see great deals built enough in the pipeline and hopefully will convert into more of such enterprise opportunities. But overall, the enterprise pipeline looks very healthy and hoping for more big deals like that coming up in 2024.Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst When you think about the infrastructure that you are putting in, whether it's go-to-market, the platform scalability, just give us an example of what you are doing to get ready. I guess many have kind of cited, is this the same strategy that salesforce saw when they started small, went mid, went large, and ultimately large became bigger than small? Are you seeing something similar to their pathway? Or what's giving you confidence that you can make that move?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, so again, I don't know the details of what Salesforce has done, but we've been working very hard on our infrastructure to support it. Obviously, we've talked about mondayDB, but this needs to be a flagship project for us as a company and we continue to roll out minor versions and we have some major versions coming up. Also, we make a lot of improvements to the platform, not just in terms of features and functionality, but also in terms of security and governments and permissions. It's an ongoing work for us and we talk with customers consistently and keep improving the platform. And also, we improve our go-to-market and the way we navigate ourselves with the organization and reaching decision makers. So, all in all, if I could buy anything, everything I said, you know, working on the infrastructure, working on the product, working on the go-to-market, our sales team, and we're very optimistic in our ability to continue in scale in the enterprise segment.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.George Iwanyc -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. You continue to steadily add to your channel and partner programs. Can you give us some color on the impact that this is having on your deal pipeline and on the CRM and dev momentum as well?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Thanks. This is Roy. So, yeah, we're very proud of the partner channels we have. We have great partners and we are continuing to add more. We are more like we are with the entire organization with the partners. We're also focused on going off-market and deepening what partners do with our customers, like more services, helping them scale, giving consultancy, and so on. Essentially supporting us in regions we don't have sales, but also in the regions we do operate ourselves. And we see that as a great thing going forward we invest more in.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Maybe just to add to what Roy said, you know, we have a robust partner network, now with over 180 channel partners with some of the top world SIs like Accenture, Hitachi, KPMG, and we're also building a lot of our SVs on our marketplace. So, this is an area of investment that will continue to generate ARR and potential opportunities for us.George Iwanyc -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst And, Eliran, maybe can you give us some color on how the international markets are behaving on a relative basis?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, George, for us it's pretty stable. If you think about our business, around 50% is coming from North America. I believe 62% coming from the U.S. and Canada. We are seeing very strong momentum in Europe and in places where we don't have sales organizations, we operate to your prior question with partners. The momentum is good and relatively stable in terms of international expansion.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Berg with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Michael Berg -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the success in the quarter. I wanted to ask what you feel is allowing you to see success in this choppy macro, in particular with SMBs. Is there anything in particular about your product or go-to-market or even just like the increased breadth of the offering now that's allowing you to see this incremental success relative to many of the other SMB software vendors in this market?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy here. So, we feel very strong with SMBs as we saw that -- because monday is the platform and you can do a lot of things with it. We see that they really rely on us in these times and kind of add more use cases and see the true value of the platform. And so, that's why we keep seeing that they are very stable throughout this last period, while we're also very strong in acquiring new ones. As everyone mentioned, we see less competition in general, because like other players have chosen to go upmarket. And we're really pushing on the performance marketing and really understanding how to reach those customers on a growing scale. So, it's a very good market for us.Michael Berg -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Makes sense. And then, one quick follow-up, free cash flow had a really nice performance in the quarter, and you raised that outlook fairly nicely for the rest of the year. Anything in particular driving the strength in free cash flow dynamics relative to where you were expecting the gain of the year?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. So, Michael, in terms of kind of the variance between free cash flow and operating profit, so I would say 50% is related to strong cash collection from the SMBs as we see strong, the top of funnel activity. The price uplift as a reminder, we -- it was mostly there, monthly ones on February and some upmarket contracts. Around 20% of this is related to interest income due to the healthy balance sheet that we have. And I would say around 30% is related to normal timing of expenses. Just as a reminder, we expect free cash flow margin to come down in Q2 due to seasonality as we pay bonuses. This is price increase -- sorry, salary increases are being paid in Q2, as well as the headcount that we hired in Q1 also going to be fully onboarded in Q2. But overall, we feel very comfortable with what we said. We generate $1 billion free cash flow over the period of 2023 to 2026 and striving to get the 25% annual free cash flow margin, as we said.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Enders with Citi. Please go ahead.Steve Enders -- Citi -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks for taking the question there and congrats on the results. Pretty impressive given the macro it seems like we're seeing out there. I just maybe just to start, I want to ask on the CRM side and now that that's kind of like fully rolled out or able to be sold into the base, how are we kind of viewing the opportunity to drive that and, you know, maybe potentially converting customers who are already using monday as a CRM into that solutions that like -- do you view that as kind of being the real bulk of the opportunity, or kind of like what are the catalyst to potentially convert some of those customers over into using the full blown CRM solution from you?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Hi, Steve. This is Eran. So, I'll split the answer into two. I think with the smaller accounts, the SMBs, it's going to be easier. Some of them are not used the CRM so it was an easy adoption for us. The other, we're also working on a bunch of migration tools. So, I think for the smaller customers, we've seen faster adoption is going to be easier. For the larger ones, it's a bit more complicated. It's not just seen, we have another product we need to talk with the decision-makers. So, that's another thing we're working on, reaching different functions within the organization and doing more top-down selling to those accounts. Obviously, we also need to mature the price a little bit if you want to support it. So, I can say that we've seen, you know, already great cross sell from SMBs and over time we'll see more and more of the larger organizations adopting full blown CRM or monday dev.Steve Enders -- Citi -- Analyst OK, great. That's helpful context. And then, I guess maybe on the pricing side and, some of the customer behavior that you're seeing, I guess, maybe how is the -- is there a difference between maybe what you're hearing from or what you're seeing from the monthly customers versus some of the annuals, is there beginning to come up on renewal and now that you have a couple of months of data here?Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, this is Eran again. So, yeah, overall, like we're very, the results are pretty solid. Like, we're very happy with the churn profile. We haven't seen, much increase in terms of churn. Same goes for downgrade. So, obviously, the monthlies are most impacted because they can make a decision to leave at any given time, basically. You know, we ran our own model, and we saw the results are even better than we expected. So, for us, it has a lot of confidence and we even expect the annual accounts to behave even in a better way because they're a little bit less price sensitive. So, all in all, in terms of churn, downgrade, we don't see any major impact. And we see accounts continue and upgrade their accounts, even the ones that obviously got their price increased. So, overall, very good from the results.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Michael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yeah, thank you for the question. Good to see reports of weakness where we're greatly exaggerated in the quarter, so happy to see that. A couple of questions, if I could. You know, so, first on competitive deals, where you do see them, love to get some insight from you on, whether or not you're winning more of the competitive deals and if you are what you think the differentiator is to drive success with those?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy here. So, I think like we see great traction within the competitors when we do compete on larger deals. We see that we're able to compete very well. And we are working hard on our roadmap to even close all gaps that we have against competitors. So, I think we're in a really great place with work management compared to competitors within the enterprise space. The CRM and dev, like Eran said, it's still early days compared to the other very large competitors out there. But we do see great traction more on the SMB side and compete on those fronts really well, SMB to small midmarket.Michael Funk -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst That's helpful. The second one is actually multi-part and relates to price and then insurance. So, first, how should we think about pricing going forward? Do you plan on having predictable annual price increases or will it be more ad hoc? Then as you do get more cross-sell, can you walk us through how either conceptually or quantitatively you think about that benefiting churn and then the two pieces together price and churn, how does that factor into the growth algorithm longer term?Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. So, Mike, this is Eliran. With regards to price increase, we try to make sure that when we increase price, we do it based on value that we provide to our customers. We added a lot of value throughout the last few years and this is why we were only, for the first time, we increased the price for our existing customer base. So, I think, you know, we don't have a clear answer on which regards to what would be the annual yet, but I think overall we think it will be more tied to value-added, you know, value-adding rather than just having like you know the majority of it coming every year. The second thing which regards to cross-sell, so I think the combination of us opening the existing products of CRM, dev together with the work management to existing customers will allow us to see, you know, cross-sell opportunities with existing customer base and potentially with new customers, but it will take probably a few quarters to get a better understanding of the trend. I think once we have this packaging of the different products alongside the fact that we are introducing additional features and functionalities, cross-sell potentially is going to be, you know, with positive momentum, not necessarily having to be tied to a price increase.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Hi, everyone, a really nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. The customer accounts for CRM and dev are becoming meaningful at this point. How do you think about the types or size of customers that are actually buying that solution today? Are they still some of your smaller customers, you are seeing some adaption in some of the maybe mid or enterprise customers that you're selling the core platform to?Roy Mann -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, it's Roy. So, yeah, we do see CRM and dev play way more on the SMB and small midmarket rather than the larger customers we have. We do see very small, let's say, implementations within larger enterprises, but I think we have a very long roadmap on both products to reach those large enterprises' deployments on such products, if that helps.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you. And then, Eliran, you mentioned before, contract terms have been pretty consistent. I believe it's 80% annual, 20% monthly. Are you seeing any real changes on that one way or the other? Historically, in times of maybe a little bit of economic pressure, customers will either switch to monthly or only bi-monthly up front to give some flexibility into their spending plans, just to know if you're seeing any changes there at all.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Scott. It's Eliran. No, I don't see any change to where we are now. Basically, we saw in the last few years -- actually, we saw a transition from monthly to annually. I think the 80%, 20% kind of by and large is something that is going to be very stable throughout the years, and I don't expect any material changes to that.Scott Berg -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking my question.OperatorYour next question comes from the line up Taylor McGinnis with UBS. Please go ahead.Taylor McGinnis -- UBS -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, congrats on the quarter and thanks so much for taking my question. My first one is just going back to the impact from price potentially in 1Q and maybe asked a different way. So, Eliran is it fair to assume that the up list would have contributed less than 6 million in 1Q, if the contribution should scale throughout the year? Just trying to understand how we think about that trajectory. When you provide that 25 million in uplift, just to clarify, is that the impact just from the install base or does that include the year-over-year impact from potentially higher new customer lands as well, too? Thank you.Eliran Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Taylor. So, maybe we'll start with the second question. With regards to 25 million, this is taking into account potentially some scenarios that we did for existing and new customers, modeling all kinds of scenarios. So, this is taking everything into account. With regards to your first question, if I understood it correctly, I think the contribution to a strong performance was, I would say, half overall the business, the healthy type of funnel and the fact that we had good momentum with existing customers and half of it, I would say, was coming from the price increase. If the chain profile would have been worse than what we saw, potentially the numbers would have been lower. If I understood correctly what you asked.Taylor McGinnis -- UBS -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks so much. Then, my second question is that now with CRM widely available this year, it seems like that could be a big opportunity for you guys. I think if I look back last quarter, penetration of your total customer base was around 6%. So, I guess how would you just thinking about the trajectory of that business? Because it seems like this year could start to get to a, you know, scale that it could add a couple of points to growth. So, just out of the gate, would love to see -- would love just a little bit more color in terms of how you guys are thinking about penetration and the trajectory of that. Thanks.Eran Zinman -- Co-Chief Executive Officer Hi, Taylor. This is Eran. So, yeah, I totally agree. Like the cross sell-numbers, we're looking pretty solid and continue to perform really well. For us, it just feels like the beginning of taping into our existing customer base. Bear in mind that also for new customers, we encourage them to buy more than just one product when they sign up. So, there's a lot potential with new customers as well. We continue to promote the products in our platform and in our homepage. Overall, we're very happy with the rate of adoption of the new products. And like we mentioned, we also plan to continue and go up-market with our bigger customers. So, all in all, I think this presents a big opportunity for our existing customer base and also for our new customer.Operator[Operator instructions] There's no more question at this time.

Joining me today are Carsten Koerl, our chief executive officer; and Ger Griffin, chief financial officer. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carson. Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. We are excited to be speaking to you today about the momentum we are seeing across our business and our strong start to the year. There are a number of key takeaways I want to highlight from the quarter and for the year ahead. First, we delivered strong top-line growth with revenues up 28% as we saw strength across our business and benefited from the uptake of our NBA and ATP content and solutions and the strong execution of our team. Second, we continued to be laser focused on driving efficiencies in our organization and delivered 18% adjusted EBITDA margins, which were ahead of our estimations. Third, we are raising our guidance, given this strong performance and our confidence in the year ahead. We now expect to grow full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA by at least 21%. Fourth, we recently named key additions to our leadership team, naming a new CFO and a chief technology and AI officer. And fifth, we are commencing our share repurchase program in the upcoming trading window. This action is supported by our confidence in our outlook and the strong value we see in our stock. The success we are seeing is underpinned by our competitive advantages. Sportradar is a global technology leader with a differentiated and commanding position in the sports ecosystem. No other company matches our scale, reach our resources, bringing together over 800 betting operators, 400 sport leagues, and 900 media partners covering nearly a million sport matches every year. The breadth and depth of our content, data, and leading technology provides us unmatched insights into the diverse portfolio of sport and bettors preferences, enabling us to create innovative solutions for our clients and engaging a personalized experience for the sport fans worldwide. Our confidence in the year ahead is backed by our consistent track record, having achieved profitable revenue growth of at least 20% for each of the last three years, as well as being cash generative. We believe there are no other companies in our peer group, public or private, that have achieved this. Now, let's turn to our Quarter 1 results. We saw strong results on both the top and bottom line as we grew revenue 28% year over year to 266 million euros and adjusted EBITDA 29% to 47 million euros. This marks a great start to the year. Before I get into the details of the results, I wanted to note that this quarter, we simplified our financial reporting approach to align with the recent changes to our organization and to address feedback we have received to present our financials in a simpler way and that aligns with our business fundamentals. And now, to our revenue growth. Betting technology and solutions revenue were up 35%, and sports content technology solutions revenue were up 5%. From a geographic mix, rest of the world revenues were up 19% year over year, while U.S. revenues were up 65% year over year. We saw the tangible and significant benefits from our ATP and NBA partnership, which are amplifying our revenue growth, helping drive pricing and customer uptake of additional services. In fact, customers' uptake on ATP content and solutions is running above our plan, and we have already seen more than 50% of ATP clients signing up for our four audiovisual product. A number are also taking our latest innovations like Sportradar 4Sight streaming, reinforcing the premium nature of this content. Given this performance, we have raised our full-year's outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth to at least 21%. Underscoring these excellent results, we will be putting our 200 million share repurchase program to work during the upcoming trading window. Now, turning to some of the operational highlights in the quarter and more recently. We are very pleased to have recently announced a new long-term partnership with UTR Sports for the UTR Pro Tennis Tour, the top tennis tour for rising professionals. Harnessing our industry leading AI and computer vision technology, we will create new analysis and insights in each match, helping to drive fan engagement and expanding in-play opportunities. Tennis is the second most bet on sports, and UTR provides Sportradar with a consistent volume of tennis matches throughout the year, complimenting our tennis portfolio and reinforcing our selective approach to expand our sports rights. We saw continued momentum in our core products in the quarter. Like our managed trading services, our MTS solution, which offers sophisticated trading risk and liability management for sportsbooks continues to be a leader in the marketplace. Turnover grew 28% year over year to approximately 9 billion this quarter, ranking us as a top bookmaker globally based on liquidity. In our ads business, we delivered personalized digital advertising at scale that drives customer acquisition for our online betting and casino clients. We work with over 150 brands across multiple digital media channels, including programmatic and paid social. With over 10 billion ad impressions delivered in the first quarter alone, we ranked as one of the top advertisers in the online betting and casino space. Key to our success is our ability to transform the deep data and rich insights from our portfolio operators, enabling us to develop new and enhanced products and create a more immersive betting experience and stimulate in-play. One of the exciting products we recently launched is Alpha Odds, a game-changing offering which builds on our market-leading core of solutions by generating odds data individual sportsbooks based on their real-time liquidity and deep data. It has proven to generate a higher margin for sportsbooks on their betting tickets. In fact, over the recently concluded UEFA European Championship qualifying match, it increased profits by an average of 15%. While we initially launched Alpha Odds in soccer, it is now live in tennis and seeing promising results, and we will soon be introducing it to basketball. By Quarter 1, 2025, we plan to release it in three more sports, bringing total coverage for our turnover to approximately 90%. We are leading when it comes to innovation and product development, and this is fueling our growth in fact. Sportradar made Fast Company's 2024 list of most innovative companies in sport for our leading Computer Vision technology and Enhanced Table Tennis solutions. Our leadership and teams are the drivers for this success, and they have an unwavering commitment and dedication to making Sportradar one of the most exciting places to be in the sport industry. On this front, we recently welcomed two talented executives on the leadership team. I am delighted to welcome Craig Felenstein as our chief financial officer; and Behshad Behzadi as our chief technology officer and chief AI officer. Craig is a seasoned finance executive and has over 30 years of experience working in finance on U.S. publicly listed companies such as Discovery, News Corp, and Viacom. He joins us from Lindblad Expeditions where he was CFO for approximately seven years. Craig will be coming on board starting June 1st, and I'm looking forward to partnering with him as we look to continue to drive our business momentum, operational leverage, and shareholder value. Behshad joined us from Google where he played a key role in developing Google's AI strategy and commercializing some of its most recognized products, including Google Assistant, Google Lens, and Next-gen AI Assistant. I'm very excited to have him sitting in Switzerland headquarters with me. His dual job title reflects the importance we place in the development of our AI capabilities and the role which he is having in shaping. You will be hearing more about this in the coming quarters, but I believe its impact will be transformational for our company. These additions complement an executive team that is an already highly talented, passionate, and driven to win. I have great confidence in our team's ability to continue to drive our business forward in the years ahead. I also want to take this moment to thank Ger for his contributions and leadership. He was of meaningful strength in our financial organization and is leaving us with a strong team and foundation. I know I speak for the entire organization when I say it has been a great pleasure working with Ger, and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Now, touching on our key priorities. Our leadership team is focused on driving shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy where the fundamental pillars are centered around content, data, and technology. By exploring the full depth and breadth of our content, data rights, and technology portfolio, we are investing in exciting new products that will deliver future value for our clients and enhancing our growth in the coming years. By using our advanced technology and AI capabilities, we are enhancing our core products across odds making, trading, and marketing services. This in turn will help drive fan engagement and operators monitorization. The strategy beyond the immediate priorities is taking shape with a key step being the recruitment of a technology leader with leader skills and experience. As a technologist, this truly excites me. I look forward to sharing more about our plans around AI and our exciting future in the coming quarters. To wrap up, this is the year of execution, and we are delivering on our core commitments for 2024 while positioning ourselves for continued growth in the exciting year to come. It was an excellent quarter, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver strongly in the year ahead. Our financial performance was underpinned by the depth and scale of our business fundamentals, the strategic investments we are making for the future, and our leadership team's laser-sharp focus on execution and driving efficiency. All of these factors are enabling us to continue to lead the industry with our growth strategy and unwavering focus on client and shareholder value. I'm extremely optimistic about Sportradar's outlook and long-term future. And now, I will turn it over to Ger.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Carsten, for your kind words. It has been a pleasure to work with you and the great team at Sportradar. I would also like to welcome Craig and Behshad to the leadership team. I remain a big fan of the company and wish you all the best in the exciting growth years ahead. With respect to 2024, we are very happy with our positive start this quarter where we delivered strong growth top and bottom. Our business fundamentals continue to be strong, and we are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024 where we are raising our full-year outlook. Before I get into the detail of our Q1 performance and our improved outlook for 2024, I want to briefly comment on the changes we've made to our financial reporting. While there is no change to our core financial statements, we will now report and discuss our financial performance on a consolidated basis, supported by supplemental revenue analysis by major product grouping and by major geographic region. This reporting approach is more in line with our streamlined global organizational structure and how we manage our business. We have posted to our Investor Relations section of our website an overview of these changes. With that, let's discuss our Q1 financial performance. Our Q1 financial results reinforce the durability and the scalability of our growth profile, as well as our focus on profitability. Revenue was 266 million euros, up 58 million or 28% year over year. We had a net loss in the quarter of 1 million euros versus a profit of 7 million euros in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 47 million euros, up 11 million or 29% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18%, in line with the prior year. Net cash from operating activities was 67 million, up 10 million or 17% year over year. Our strong revenue growth was driven primarily by the recurring client revenue streams, leveraging our best-in-class products and content portfolio, amplified this year by the incremental contributions from our ATP and NBA partnership deals. Betting technology and solutions represented 82% of our total revenues and delivered 219 million, up 56 million or 35% year over year. This was driven primarily by streaming and betting engagement, up 26 million or 46% year over year; live data and odds, up 19 million or 29% year over year; and managed betting services, up 12 million or 32% year over year. For content technology and services, represented 18% of total revenues and delivered 47 million, up 2 million or 5% year over year, driven primarily by marketing and media services which grew 6%. On a geographic basis, our rest of world client base represented 75% of total revenues and delivered 200 million, up 33 million or 19% year over year. Our U.S. client base represented 25% of total revenues and delivered 66 million, up 26 million or 65% year over year. We generated a loss in the quarter of 1 million euros, compared to a profit of 7 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher finance costs and foreign currency losses, which collectively accounted for 24 million of the year-over-year change. This was partially offset by a 7 million lower stock based compensation expense and an 11 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Looking at our adjusted EBITDA, it was 47 million, up 11 million or 29% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 18%, in line with the prior year. While our adjusted EBITDA margins were flat year on year, the strategic actions we've taken to date, as well as the continued focus on sustainable profitability in '24, delivered a 10 percentage point improvement in operating leverage collectively in personnel, cost of sales, and other operating costs. This helped to offset the impact on operating leverage resulting from the one-time step-up in sports rights costs primarily for the first year of the NBA and ATP partnership deals. Personal expenses were 80 million, up 3 million or 3% year over year, as we benefited from the cost actions announced last year and our focus on delivering improved operating leverage. Other operating expenses were 21 million, broadly flat year over year, as they also benefited from the cost actions announced last year and are focused on delivering improved operating leverage. Sports rights were 91 million, up 40 million or 78% year over year, driven by new rights, in particular, our ATP and NBA partnership deals. This increase was in line with our expectations. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet close to the quarter with liquidity of 495 million, comprised of 275 million in cash and cash equivalents and a 220 million revolving credit facility with no amounts outstanding. On cash flow, we expect to see stronger cash generation over the remaining quarters of this year and are on track to achieve robust cash flow generation for the full year. With our strong business fundamentals and our confidence in the long-term profitability and cash flow outlook for the company, we feel our stock is very attractive at current valuation levels. Accordingly, we expect to commence purchases under our previously announced $200 million share buyback program in the upcoming trading window. In summary, we delivered a strong Q1 financial performance, including record revenues, as well as a strong adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to be laser focused on improving operating leverage and profitability. With that, let's turn to our revised 2024 outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising our full-year outlook and now expect to deliver at least 21% growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which equates to the following. Revenue of 1.060 billion versus the prior guidance of 1.050 billion; adjusted EBITDA of 202 million versus our prior guidance of 200 million; adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 19%. Some factors to consider when assessing our outlook for 2024. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by our strong recurring client revenue streams, leveraging our best-in-class products and content portfolio amplified this year by the addition of our ATP and NBA partnerships. As we've noted in the past, we are continuously challenging all aspects of our business to ensure that we're focusing our talent and resources on the most profitable growth opportunities and unlocking operating leverage. We expect the strategic actions we've taken to date, as well as our continued focus on sustainable profitability in 2024, will unlock operating leverage in personnel, cost of sales, and other operating costs. This should offset the impact on operating leverage resulting from the one-time step-up in sports rights costs from the first full year of the NBA and ATP partnership deals. For the year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to progress from the mid to high teens in the first half of the year into the low 20s in the second half of the year. This seasonality is primarily a function of the phasing of sports rights costs and the realization of the full-year run-rate benefits from our cost actions. We continue to be very much focused on enhancing margins and free cash flow generation. As we look beyond 2024, we see the potential to unlock operating leverage from all major expense line items as we actively manage our operating cost run rates and benefit from a more stable sports rights portfolio cost base. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent Q1 performance and how the rest of the year is unfolding. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we are very well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024. Before I hand off to the operator for questions, I would like to thank all of our investors and analysts for their support. It's been a pleasure engaging with you, and I wish you and Sportradar success in the exciting years ahead. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator, will you open the line for questions? Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Hey. Good day, Carsten. And best of luck in future endeavors, Ger. I want to start with data rights. So, you're on the tail end of your new NBA contract or, I guess, year one of that. But what, I guess, have you learned, kind of how that's progressed, the ability to pass through price to your customers and then as you think about negotiating new deals with your existing leagues but also potential new ones?Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Ryan. Carsten here. So, as you see in the numbers, we very successfully integrated ATP and NBA, the new contract, in our portfolio. And as you see in the U.S. numbers, we exactly and reached and overreached what we had in mind. So, we could upsell more of the players in the market with the ATP content, specifically here in this case, we believe. So, we have the effect from our strong position in the market that we can leverage this and upsell based on this content. And as you see in the growth and as you see in the adjusted EBITDA, we compensated the up-step in the sports rights like predicted, and we demonstrate here a very strong performance with the new properties. We are very happy looking into the next years because, as we all know, we have the amortization linear for many years in case of NBA now still a seven years to go in case of ATP of five years. So, we will profit with the strong growth year over year because the cost base is linear and similar to this year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Very good. For my second question. Just curious on guidance. So nice to see kind of strong results in Q1 raising your expectations for the year. I guess the beat on Q1 versus street expectations was bigger than you're flowing through to the guidance. Maybe that is just a little bit of management versus street expectations on kind of a quarterly basis. But anything to be aware of from a cost standpoint or anything kind of throughout the rest of the year on kind of Q1 versus the guide?Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Ryan, it's Ger. Listen, as we said, very happy with the Q1 performance, both top and bottom. And I think even more importantly, how we see the year unfolding. Our decision was to release an extra point of growth on revenues and EBITDA through to our -- our updated outlook. In terms of the spend side of things, there was -- there was a bit of phasing. We had some credits from a cloud service point of view that hit the quarter where we expected them to turn up mid-year. And, you know, there is a little bit of phasing in terms of how some of our projects are rolling out. But, as you saw, we're quite happy with how the year is unfolding. And we'll see when we get through the end of Q2 to see if there's more that we can release into the full year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Any way to quantify that, Ger? If not, that's OK. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Nice job.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer It's in the -- it's around 5 million to 6 million, you know, from an EBITDA perspective that you'll see sort of blended into the second half of the year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Very good. Well done, guys.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer And thank you for my endeavors.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.Michael Graham -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thanks a lot, and congrats on the strong performance. I wanted to ask two questions. The first is just with the appointment of Behshad as chief technology and AI officer. Just interested in how you see the benefits of that initiative, either in terms of growth or in enhanced profitability. Just maybe talk about the key leverage points there. And then somewhat related to that, just maybe at a high level, talk about the building blocks to get from where you are now in terms of EBITDA margin closer to your long-term target of 25% to 30%.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Michael. Carsten here. I'll take the first part and leave then the building blocks to Ger. I'm super proud and very excited that we could convince a professional like Behshad to join our company, knowing that he was really the driving force behind Google's European activities in AI, driving a product like Google Lens and a couple of other things. I mentioned it in the call. You can imagine how proud we are that we could convince him to run our business. So, given this, you see MTS's performance is strongly up. Alpha Odds is generating a 15% higher profit, which is sensational on trading, comparing it to what we have at the moment. So, it's all about to build the engine to ingest massive data on all levels, the fan data, the liquidity information, which is there, and of course, the real-time sports data and then use this in the products to generate the value for our clients. So, there is lots to come, a lot of new products which we mentioned a couple of them. And Behshad will drive this development. The abilities which you have with AI is very hard to predict for the next few years. But one thing is very sure. This is a core technology to be deployed, and we have now set up, which is making us, by far, the strongest in the market. Handing over to Ger.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, in terms of the operating leverage, you know, the way we think about the business if you sort of break down, the spend, you've got your sports rights, which, this year, is a material step up. But as we look to the out years, we see the sports rights cost base to be a more stable cost base, which will obviously give us the ability to leverage that from an operating leverage point of view. But the big-ticket items starting at the highest numbers are -- is our people and talent. That's the largest spend in the company in terms of our personnel costs. And then next will be sports rights, and then you've got all other operating spend and cost of sales. Those lines, as you saw this year, given the actions we've taken and our continuing revenue growth, are delivering at least five points of operating leverage, which is offsetting the step-up in sports rights this year. If you think about all of those lines going into '25 and '26 and '27, our expectation is that our revenue growth will be ahead of the growth that will be in those lines. And and those lines will meaningfully help us get to our long-term goals of between 25% and 30% EBITDA margins. So, the sort of the key to it all is having a more normalized level of sports rights and then continuing to drive operating leverage across all lines.Michael Graham -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst All right, perfect. Thanks so much.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks. I know you mentioned some, I guess, credit that came in in Q1 that you had expected later in the year, so there was some timing shift. But if we just look at the full-year raise, your revenues up 10 million, the guidance and the EBITDA up 2 million. So, just wanted to ask how we should think about flow through. In other words, are there -- so, revenue is coming in better than you thought, but it seems like expenses are as well coming in a little bit offsetting some of that incremental 10 million. So, if you could just help us think about that flow through. And then my other question is -- you were talking about sports rights being fairly fixed going forward. Can you talk to us about how Major League Baseball may impact that? And I don't know if that's something you'll quantify. I know you don't -- you haven't officially come out with anything on that, but how we should think about that impacting your outlook if those sports rights costs go up. Thanks.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. For now, Robin, we -- so, we made the decision to give a percentage point uplift in our growth for top and bottom. I think in terms of the revenue performance, as we said, we saw a very nice pickup in ATP, both in absolute terms but also in terms of the mix. And you will see that our sports rights were obviously up. And so, when you think about flow through, there is a correlation there in terms of the sports rights cost and the ramp of the revenue. As we progress through these contracts, obviously, the flow through gets a lot better. And so, you'll see the contribution to margin expansion in the out years. But as we look at it now, it's not -- it was not a high flow through in terms of the -- that you would expect in a more normalized situation. But again, we're giving you an extra point. We're holding the margin. We'll see how we land middle of the year. And yeah, we'll take it from there. But the key point I'd like to reemphasize is we love where our fundamentals are, and we like the way the year is unfolding.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer And to the second part, Robin, MLB, there is nothing to be announced today. But we have -- we are very confident that we can grow and extend our relationship with the MLB in the very soon future. They are very valued partner for us, like many others, NBA, NHL as a sample, or also UEFA. So, we have a very strong portfolio as we said a couple of times. We see nothing material, nothing which is upcoming in the next couple of years, which is not predicted. So, we have a stable portfolio. We can monetize on this. We will always look to the ROI when we invest into new sports rights, and we will execute ruthless on this. So, if we have sports rights where we believe they are contributing to our margin, we will look into this. But the portfolio which we have is long term is very stable, and is big enough that we can deliver the numbers. So, we will do this very selectively with new sports rights but always looking to the return of investment.Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Good morning. This is Stefanos Crist calling in for Bernie. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to ask on the new revenue groups. Could you talk about the difference in incremental margins between the two? Thanks.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer The -- actually, from a margin profile perspective, they're not dramatically different. I think the -- obviously, the difference between the two groupings is the critical masses are core betting. It's data odds, MTS, and there's strong flow through there. The secondary group, which has sports solutions, media, is slightly less, but we do see opportunities to grow those revenue streams in the future, in particular. When we look at advertising, that could improve the overall margin profile over the long term. But right now, yeah, the -- our betting solutions group is obviously a higher margin, but it's not dramatically different.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. And just to follow up, sports betting accelerated in the quarter year over year. You talked about the major drivers, but do you expect revenue to continue to accelerate in your guidance?Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Well, we've given you the guidance, the increase in terms of the extra percentage point. But yes, year over year, I think all the quarters, you're going to see strong growth.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Hey, Carsten, Ger, Jim. Great quarter, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Good luck, Ger. Will miss you. Thanks for the memories, bud. I guess the question is on the U.S. regulatory environment. It certainly looks like the pressure is starting to ramp here. And obviously, Carsten, you've run a global business for a couple of decades here, so I think you have a pretty good view on how regulatory change can sort of creep into mature markets. Obviously, we're far from mature, but we're starting to see a little bit of pressure. Just sort of curious how you think it's going to play out in the U.S., how it could impact your business, and how you're thinking about maybe proactive steps that you can take as a partner with operators and sort of a service to the industry and sort of getting in front, maybe sort of self-correcting and avoiding any potential federal or state oversight more than we have. Thanks, guys.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Michael. So, looking now to the U.S. market regulatory environment and the changes in some states, we see, at the moment, no negative impact on our business. We understand from all our partners that this is a constant process. And if I'm looking now back on all the years I'm in this business, that's quite useful. You need to find your way. You need to find what is the sweet spot, where to go, what are the rules, and the values which are critical for everybody. For example, responsible gaming is very important. Taxation is very important for the states. I'm very confident that we will find here the right way. And as I said, at the moment, there is no negative impact on us. And it's a moderation. It's constant talk with all the players in that market, the sport, the governments, the regulators and, of course, also our partners in the industry. And that's what we are doing. So, I'm very confident that this will continue to develop in the right way. And by the way, as a remark, I was traveling in Brazil three weeks ago having there also many talks with the finance minister, all the sports, which are in there and all the players in the market. It's a pretty similar plot, much more early stage than the U.S., but it takes a while to moderate this to find the best way to satisfy all interest groups.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Nice. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.Unknown speaker Hey, guys. This is [Inaudible] for David Katz. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. There's been an unstated focus on core products. Could you describe how you're thinking about what is core and what isn't, as in what stays and goes and what are the financial implications? Thank you.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Well, we are looking on the product ROI. That's the most important for us. That's where we want to deploy our capital. And so, looking now to the products, you will see a lot of activities around innovative products, which are driven by ingesting massive deep data and creating value for our clients. So, you will see investments from us in that space because they simply deliver the highest return. We will look for our operational leverage like we demonstrated it now in the U.S. marketplace with some properties and content. ATP is a perfect example of how we can use our engine to massively distribute this kind of content. So, we will see some investments there, always with the reminder we are looking to the product ROI if we buy those properties. So, this is our core focus area. Looking now to the whole ecosystem and to broaden it a little bit, it is very exciting to use fan information for marketing activities to generate leads for our clients and, of course, then to create following up the trading services and probability predictions from them for those sports fans. So, we are just closing that circle, using all the information which we have to provide additional value for our clients.Unknown speaker Great, That's all for me. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.Jordan Bender -- JMP Securities -- Analyst Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. There seems to be a lot of positive momentum coming from the NBA. Can you maybe just breakdown some of those factors, the inputs going in there, maybe between increased volume or some of the pricing or even shift in play and how those are kind of translating to some of the positive commentary coming out of that? And then for the follow-up, when we think about the path to your EBITDA margin target of 25%-plus, do you have all the pieces in place today, maybe from even a technology or a footprint base to kind of achieve those targets? Thank you.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I'll take the first part. That's the question with the NBA. It was a hard work during the last 12 months to convince the market with our new NBA contract to get this locked in. As you see in the numbers, we have been very successful with this. Now, it is how can we create value with the enhanced partnership. As you know, we have now deep data from the NBA, and we can use this in product flight foresight or, much more important, in the trading products, in Alpha Odds. So, we get now significantly better real-time information, and we can visualize this. And we have products on all levels. Like we said last time with the lead press, we have now a product that we can put into the live screen to odds directly and stimulate the players. And that's very successful. So, this is something where we see a huge potential in the future. I could speak hours about this. But looking now forward for the next couple of years, there is a lot of leverage what we can unlock with the NBA as being one of the premium sports properties in the U.S.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer In terms of thinking about the operating leverage, all the ingredients are -- they're effectively in the building, and there's a little bit of timing here. When you look at our core execution in 2024, it's all about continuing to drive the core product offering and recurring revenue streams and then layering in ATP, NBA and the run rate benefits of other clients like the Taiwanese lottery. As you go into '25 and '26, it continues to focus on driving the core growth. From an investment point of view, continuing to enhance our product portfolio, whether it's rationalizing based on ROI, as Carsten said, our core that we have today, layering in new products like Alpha Odds and emBET and continuing to bring additional products to market driven off deep data and other technology innovations. So, that's all embedded into the overall operating model. And as I said earlier, as long as we maintain our focus on the level of growth that you see in our people costs, as we continue to invest in our teams and all other operating spend, and we continue to drive what is a more stable sports rights base, yes, we'll add to it, but not the same material that you saw in '24. Then you will start to see the points of margin flow through to the P&L. TBD how long it will take us to get to the ultimate goal of 25%, 30%. But it's not that far away.Jordan Bender -- JMP Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Ger, and best of luck.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.Jim Bombassei -- Head of Investor Relations Michelle, we'll take our last question.OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about pricing. Just as we think about the contracts and the new NBA contract, my question is simply, do we see an increase in pricing that is kind of a one-time movement, i.e. are you changing the contractual rates with your customers that move up and is going to be recognized as sort of the data as we see the data rights come in, or is a little bit more -- is everything more revenue share, and that'll kind of -- so we should see continued commensurate growth of what we're seeing now as we move out into the latter part of the year and more into 2025? Thanks.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Shaun. So, this is Carsten. The core thing here is looking now to the existing model, which we have in the U.S., its revenue share as we all know. So, we will grow with the market for the existing product. I think it will never work to overstretch the pricing. We're going to need to create value with innovative solutions, which are providing that value back for our clients. Alpha Odds is a perfect example, so we can simply generate higher profits. Then our clients can do this with ingesting more data into the engine and helping them to uplift it. So, that's the way where we see a lot of growth potential. Foresight is a sample where we can use NBA. We are working here with the League Pass. To give you a number on the League Pass for the more than 600 matches which we played out there with the solution, we had an engagement rate of 3.7%, meaning 3.7% of all the people, which had seen this going into a transaction. This is, from a marketing purpose or marketing view, a sensational rate. Usually, the rate is significantly lower than 1%. That sees a 300% uplift for the users of the League Pass and for the operator who is providing the odds here. That's generating pure value for all the players. This is very powerful. Looking now into, yes, we have a good situation. We are sitting on three of the big four leagues in the U.S. with, by far, the biggest client base and distribution base there. We can leverage a little bit on the pricing, but our core focus is to create value with new products, which I mentioned a few of them.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks, Carsten. And then my follow-up would just be on Brazil. You obviously mentioned this. And what's the experience when a new -- a significant new market like this opens up or moves into regulatory. Are you already in Brazil or should we expect a bigger step function as you're able to do deals with maybe operators that you haven't done deals with before? Thanks.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer I was personally there, Shaun, three weeks ago. So, the experience was interesting with five bodyguards in Sao Paulo, which we had there on the ground. It's a wide market. It's a very exciting market. By the way, it was not necessary, all these security measurements, which have been there. Very friendly environment, people which are very passionate about the sport. Main sport there is, as we all know, soccer. A lot of development opportunities, a lot of activities. The federal government licensed or liberalized sports betting in December. So, in June, we will see now a process starting that the first operators get official license, generate taxes for the state. And it was very important for me to speak there with all stakeholders, finance ministry, speaking with the sport, with representatives from the club and from the leagues which are there. And then, of course, speaking with the operators, the foreign operators and the local operators, which are their boots on the ground. Understanding their needs is essential to create the right setup. We have a people team down there. Already, we have a legal setup there, and we are investing in that market opportunity. Looking from a size perspective, we believe that this is growing from a 2 billion GGR to round about 5 billion to 6 billion in the next three years. It's early days, as I said, and we are coming up with a complete strategy. But we are very interested to expand our footprint in Brazil and to use this growth opportunity.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you, everyone. And good luck, Ger.

Joining me today are Carsten Koerl, our chief executive officer; and Ger Griffin, chief financial officer. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carson. Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. We are excited to be speaking to you today about the momentum we are seeing across our business and our strong start to the year. There are a number of key takeaways I want to highlight from the quarter and for the year ahead. First, we delivered strong top-line growth with revenues up 28% as we saw strength across our business and benefited from the uptake of our NBA and ATP content and solutions and the strong execution of our team. Second, we continued to be laser focused on driving efficiencies in our organization and delivered 18% adjusted EBITDA margins, which were ahead of our estimations. Third, we are raising our guidance, given this strong performance and our confidence in the year ahead. We now expect to grow full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA by at least 21%. Fourth, we recently named key additions to our leadership team, naming a new CFO and a chief technology and AI officer. And fifth, we are commencing our share repurchase program in the upcoming trading window. This action is supported by our confidence in our outlook and the strong value we see in our stock. The success we are seeing is underpinned by our competitive advantages. Sportradar is a global technology leader with a differentiated and commanding position in the sports ecosystem. No other company matches our scale, reach our resources, bringing together over 800 betting operators, 400 sport leagues, and 900 media partners covering nearly a million sport matches every year. The breadth and depth of our content, data, and leading technology provides us unmatched insights into the diverse portfolio of sport and bettors preferences, enabling us to create innovative solutions for our clients and engaging a personalized experience for the sport fans worldwide. Our confidence in the year ahead is backed by our consistent track record, having achieved profitable revenue growth of at least 20% for each of the last three years, as well as being cash generative. We believe there are no other companies in our peer group, public or private, that have achieved this. Now, let's turn to our Quarter 1 results. We saw strong results on both the top and bottom line as we grew revenue 28% year over year to 266 million euros and adjusted EBITDA 29% to 47 million euros. This marks a great start to the year. Before I get into the details of the results, I wanted to note that this quarter, we simplified our financial reporting approach to align with the recent changes to our organization and to address feedback we have received to present our financials in a simpler way and that aligns with our business fundamentals. And now, to our revenue growth. Betting technology and solutions revenue were up 35%, and sports content technology solutions revenue were up 5%. From a geographic mix, rest of the world revenues were up 19% year over year, while U.S. revenues were up 65% year over year. We saw the tangible and significant benefits from our ATP and NBA partnership, which are amplifying our revenue growth, helping drive pricing and customer uptake of additional services. In fact, customers' uptake on ATP content and solutions is running above our plan, and we have already seen more than 50% of ATP clients signing up for our four audiovisual product. A number are also taking our latest innovations like Sportradar 4Sight streaming, reinforcing the premium nature of this content. Given this performance, we have raised our full-year's outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth to at least 21%. Underscoring these excellent results, we will be putting our 200 million share repurchase program to work during the upcoming trading window. Now, turning to some of the operational highlights in the quarter and more recently. We are very pleased to have recently announced a new long-term partnership with UTR Sports for the UTR Pro Tennis Tour, the top tennis tour for rising professionals. Harnessing our industry leading AI and computer vision technology, we will create new analysis and insights in each match, helping to drive fan engagement and expanding in-play opportunities. Tennis is the second most bet on sports, and UTR provides Sportradar with a consistent volume of tennis matches throughout the year, complimenting our tennis portfolio and reinforcing our selective approach to expand our sports rights. We saw continued momentum in our core products in the quarter. Like our managed trading services, our MTS solution, which offers sophisticated trading risk and liability management for sportsbooks continues to be a leader in the marketplace. Turnover grew 28% year over year to approximately 9 billion this quarter, ranking us as a top bookmaker globally based on liquidity. In our ads business, we delivered personalized digital advertising at scale that drives customer acquisition for our online betting and casino clients. We work with over 150 brands across multiple digital media channels, including programmatic and paid social. With over 10 billion ad impressions delivered in the first quarter alone, we ranked as one of the top advertisers in the online betting and casino space. Key to our success is our ability to transform the deep data and rich insights from our portfolio operators, enabling us to develop new and enhanced products and create a more immersive betting experience and stimulate in-play. One of the exciting products we recently launched is Alpha Odds, a game-changing offering which builds on our market-leading core of solutions by generating odds data individual sportsbooks based on their real-time liquidity and deep data. It has proven to generate a higher margin for sportsbooks on their betting tickets. In fact, over the recently concluded UEFA European Championship qualifying match, it increased profits by an average of 15%. While we initially launched Alpha Odds in soccer, it is now live in tennis and seeing promising results, and we will soon be introducing it to basketball. By Quarter 1, 2025, we plan to release it in three more sports, bringing total coverage for our turnover to approximately 90%. We are leading when it comes to innovation and product development, and this is fueling our growth in fact. Sportradar made Fast Company's 2024 list of most innovative companies in sport for our leading Computer Vision technology and Enhanced Table Tennis solutions. Our leadership and teams are the drivers for this success, and they have an unwavering commitment and dedication to making Sportradar one of the most exciting places to be in the sport industry. On this front, we recently welcomed two talented executives on the leadership team. I am delighted to welcome Craig Felenstein as our chief financial officer; and Behshad Behzadi as our chief technology officer and chief AI officer. Craig is a seasoned finance executive and has over 30 years of experience working in finance on U.S. publicly listed companies such as Discovery, News Corp, and Viacom. He joins us from Lindblad Expeditions where he was CFO for approximately seven years. Craig will be coming on board starting June 1st, and I'm looking forward to partnering with him as we look to continue to drive our business momentum, operational leverage, and shareholder value. Behshad joined us from Google where he played a key role in developing Google's AI strategy and commercializing some of its most recognized products, including Google Assistant, Google Lens, and Next-gen AI Assistant. I'm very excited to have him sitting in Switzerland headquarters with me. His dual job title reflects the importance we place in the development of our AI capabilities and the role which he is having in shaping. You will be hearing more about this in the coming quarters, but I believe its impact will be transformational for our company. These additions complement an executive team that is an already highly talented, passionate, and driven to win. I have great confidence in our team's ability to continue to drive our business forward in the years ahead. I also want to take this moment to thank Ger for his contributions and leadership. He was of meaningful strength in our financial organization and is leaving us with a strong team and foundation. I know I speak for the entire organization when I say it has been a great pleasure working with Ger, and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Now, touching on our key priorities. Our leadership team is focused on driving shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy where the fundamental pillars are centered around content, data, and technology. By exploring the full depth and breadth of our content, data rights, and technology portfolio, we are investing in exciting new products that will deliver future value for our clients and enhancing our growth in the coming years. By using our advanced technology and AI capabilities, we are enhancing our core products across odds making, trading, and marketing services. This in turn will help drive fan engagement and operators monitorization. The strategy beyond the immediate priorities is taking shape with a key step being the recruitment of a technology leader with leader skills and experience. As a technologist, this truly excites me. I look forward to sharing more about our plans around AI and our exciting future in the coming quarters. To wrap up, this is the year of execution, and we are delivering on our core commitments for 2024 while positioning ourselves for continued growth in the exciting year to come. It was an excellent quarter, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver strongly in the year ahead. Our financial performance was underpinned by the depth and scale of our business fundamentals, the strategic investments we are making for the future, and our leadership team's laser-sharp focus on execution and driving efficiency. All of these factors are enabling us to continue to lead the industry with our growth strategy and unwavering focus on client and shareholder value. I'm extremely optimistic about Sportradar's outlook and long-term future. And now, I will turn it over to Ger.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Carsten, for your kind words. It has been a pleasure to work with you and the great team at Sportradar. I would also like to welcome Craig and Behshad to the leadership team. I remain a big fan of the company and wish you all the best in the exciting growth years ahead. With respect to 2024, we are very happy with our positive start this quarter where we delivered strong growth top and bottom. Our business fundamentals continue to be strong, and we are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024 where we are raising our full-year outlook. Before I get into the detail of our Q1 performance and our improved outlook for 2024, I want to briefly comment on the changes we've made to our financial reporting. While there is no change to our core financial statements, we will now report and discuss our financial performance on a consolidated basis, supported by supplemental revenue analysis by major product grouping and by major geographic region. This reporting approach is more in line with our streamlined global organizational structure and how we manage our business. We have posted to our Investor Relations section of our website an overview of these changes. With that, let's discuss our Q1 financial performance. Our Q1 financial results reinforce the durability and the scalability of our growth profile, as well as our focus on profitability. Revenue was 266 million euros, up 58 million or 28% year over year. We had a net loss in the quarter of 1 million euros versus a profit of 7 million euros in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 47 million euros, up 11 million or 29% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18%, in line with the prior year. Net cash from operating activities was 67 million, up 10 million or 17% year over year. Our strong revenue growth was driven primarily by the recurring client revenue streams, leveraging our best-in-class products and content portfolio, amplified this year by the incremental contributions from our ATP and NBA partnership deals. Betting technology and solutions represented 82% of our total revenues and delivered 219 million, up 56 million or 35% year over year. This was driven primarily by streaming and betting engagement, up 26 million or 46% year over year; live data and odds, up 19 million or 29% year over year; and managed betting services, up 12 million or 32% year over year. For content technology and services, represented 18% of total revenues and delivered 47 million, up 2 million or 5% year over year, driven primarily by marketing and media services which grew 6%. On a geographic basis, our rest of world client base represented 75% of total revenues and delivered 200 million, up 33 million or 19% year over year. Our U.S. client base represented 25% of total revenues and delivered 66 million, up 26 million or 65% year over year. We generated a loss in the quarter of 1 million euros, compared to a profit of 7 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher finance costs and foreign currency losses, which collectively accounted for 24 million of the year-over-year change. This was partially offset by a 7 million lower stock based compensation expense and an 11 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Looking at our adjusted EBITDA, it was 47 million, up 11 million or 29% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 18%, in line with the prior year. While our adjusted EBITDA margins were flat year on year, the strategic actions we've taken to date, as well as the continued focus on sustainable profitability in '24, delivered a 10 percentage point improvement in operating leverage collectively in personnel, cost of sales, and other operating costs. This helped to offset the impact on operating leverage resulting from the one-time step-up in sports rights costs primarily for the first year of the NBA and ATP partnership deals. Personal expenses were 80 million, up 3 million or 3% year over year, as we benefited from the cost actions announced last year and our focus on delivering improved operating leverage. Other operating expenses were 21 million, broadly flat year over year, as they also benefited from the cost actions announced last year and are focused on delivering improved operating leverage. Sports rights were 91 million, up 40 million or 78% year over year, driven by new rights, in particular, our ATP and NBA partnership deals. This increase was in line with our expectations. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet close to the quarter with liquidity of 495 million, comprised of 275 million in cash and cash equivalents and a 220 million revolving credit facility with no amounts outstanding. On cash flow, we expect to see stronger cash generation over the remaining quarters of this year and are on track to achieve robust cash flow generation for the full year. With our strong business fundamentals and our confidence in the long-term profitability and cash flow outlook for the company, we feel our stock is very attractive at current valuation levels. Accordingly, we expect to commence purchases under our previously announced $200 million share buyback program in the upcoming trading window. In summary, we delivered a strong Q1 financial performance, including record revenues, as well as a strong adjusted EBITDA, as we continue to be laser focused on improving operating leverage and profitability. With that, let's turn to our revised 2024 outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising our full-year outlook and now expect to deliver at least 21% growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which equates to the following. Revenue of 1.060 billion versus the prior guidance of 1.050 billion; adjusted EBITDA of 202 million versus our prior guidance of 200 million; adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 19%. Some factors to consider when assessing our outlook for 2024. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by our strong recurring client revenue streams, leveraging our best-in-class products and content portfolio amplified this year by the addition of our ATP and NBA partnerships. As we've noted in the past, we are continuously challenging all aspects of our business to ensure that we're focusing our talent and resources on the most profitable growth opportunities and unlocking operating leverage. We expect the strategic actions we've taken to date, as well as our continued focus on sustainable profitability in 2024, will unlock operating leverage in personnel, cost of sales, and other operating costs. This should offset the impact on operating leverage resulting from the one-time step-up in sports rights costs from the first full year of the NBA and ATP partnership deals. For the year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to progress from the mid to high teens in the first half of the year into the low 20s in the second half of the year. This seasonality is primarily a function of the phasing of sports rights costs and the realization of the full-year run-rate benefits from our cost actions. We continue to be very much focused on enhancing margins and free cash flow generation. As we look beyond 2024, we see the potential to unlock operating leverage from all major expense line items as we actively manage our operating cost run rates and benefit from a more stable sports rights portfolio cost base. In summary, we are very pleased with our excellent Q1 performance and how the rest of the year is unfolding. Our business fundamentals are strong, and we are very well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024. Before I hand off to the operator for questions, I would like to thank all of our investors and analysts for their support. It's been a pleasure engaging with you, and I wish you and Sportradar success in the exciting years ahead. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator, will you open the line for questions? Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Hey. Good day, Carsten. And best of luck in future endeavors, Ger. I want to start with data rights. So, you're on the tail end of your new NBA contract or, I guess, year one of that. But what, I guess, have you learned, kind of how that's progressed, the ability to pass through price to your customers and then as you think about negotiating new deals with your existing leagues but also potential new ones?Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Ryan. Carsten here. So, as you see in the numbers, we very successfully integrated ATP and NBA, the new contract, in our portfolio. And as you see in the U.S. numbers, we exactly and reached and overreached what we had in mind. So, we could upsell more of the players in the market with the ATP content, specifically here in this case, we believe. So, we have the effect from our strong position in the market that we can leverage this and upsell based on this content. And as you see in the growth and as you see in the adjusted EBITDA, we compensated the up-step in the sports rights like predicted, and we demonstrate here a very strong performance with the new properties. We are very happy looking into the next years because, as we all know, we have the amortization linear for many years in case of NBA now still a seven years to go in case of ATP of five years. So, we will profit with the strong growth year over year because the cost base is linear and similar to this year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Very good. For my second question. Just curious on guidance. So nice to see kind of strong results in Q1 raising your expectations for the year. I guess the beat on Q1 versus street expectations was bigger than you're flowing through to the guidance. Maybe that is just a little bit of management versus street expectations on kind of a quarterly basis. But anything to be aware of from a cost standpoint or anything kind of throughout the rest of the year on kind of Q1 versus the guide?Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Ryan, it's Ger. Listen, as we said, very happy with the Q1 performance, both top and bottom. And I think even more importantly, how we see the year unfolding. Our decision was to release an extra point of growth on revenues and EBITDA through to our -- our updated outlook. In terms of the spend side of things, there was -- there was a bit of phasing. We had some credits from a cloud service point of view that hit the quarter where we expected them to turn up mid-year. And, you know, there is a little bit of phasing in terms of how some of our projects are rolling out. But, as you saw, we're quite happy with how the year is unfolding. And we'll see when we get through the end of Q2 to see if there's more that we can release into the full year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Any way to quantify that, Ger? If not, that's OK. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Nice job.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer It's in the -- it's around 5 million to 6 million, you know, from an EBITDA perspective that you'll see sort of blended into the second half of the year.Ryan Sigdahl -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Very good. Well done, guys.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer And thank you for my endeavors.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.Michael Graham -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thanks a lot, and congrats on the strong performance. I wanted to ask two questions. The first is just with the appointment of Behshad as chief technology and AI officer. Just interested in how you see the benefits of that initiative, either in terms of growth or in enhanced profitability. Just maybe talk about the key leverage points there. And then somewhat related to that, just maybe at a high level, talk about the building blocks to get from where you are now in terms of EBITDA margin closer to your long-term target of 25% to 30%.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Michael. Carsten here. I'll take the first part and leave then the building blocks to Ger. I'm super proud and very excited that we could convince a professional like Behshad to join our company, knowing that he was really the driving force behind Google's European activities in AI, driving a product like Google Lens and a couple of other things. I mentioned it in the call. You can imagine how proud we are that we could convince him to run our business. So, given this, you see MTS's performance is strongly up. Alpha Odds is generating a 15% higher profit, which is sensational on trading, comparing it to what we have at the moment. So, it's all about to build the engine to ingest massive data on all levels, the fan data, the liquidity information, which is there, and of course, the real-time sports data and then use this in the products to generate the value for our clients. So, there is lots to come, a lot of new products which we mentioned a couple of them. And Behshad will drive this development. The abilities which you have with AI is very hard to predict for the next few years. But one thing is very sure. This is a core technology to be deployed, and we have now set up, which is making us, by far, the strongest in the market. Handing over to Ger.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. No, in terms of the operating leverage, you know, the way we think about the business if you sort of break down, the spend, you've got your sports rights, which, this year, is a material step up. But as we look to the out years, we see the sports rights cost base to be a more stable cost base, which will obviously give us the ability to leverage that from an operating leverage point of view. But the big-ticket items starting at the highest numbers are -- is our people and talent. That's the largest spend in the company in terms of our personnel costs. And then next will be sports rights, and then you've got all other operating spend and cost of sales. Those lines, as you saw this year, given the actions we've taken and our continuing revenue growth, are delivering at least five points of operating leverage, which is offsetting the step-up in sports rights this year. If you think about all of those lines going into '25 and '26 and '27, our expectation is that our revenue growth will be ahead of the growth that will be in those lines. And and those lines will meaningfully help us get to our long-term goals of between 25% and 30% EBITDA margins. So, the sort of the key to it all is having a more normalized level of sports rights and then continuing to drive operating leverage across all lines.Michael Graham -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst All right, perfect. Thanks so much.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks. I know you mentioned some, I guess, credit that came in in Q1 that you had expected later in the year, so there was some timing shift. But if we just look at the full-year raise, your revenues up 10 million, the guidance and the EBITDA up 2 million. So, just wanted to ask how we should think about flow through. In other words, are there -- so, revenue is coming in better than you thought, but it seems like expenses are as well coming in a little bit offsetting some of that incremental 10 million. So, if you could just help us think about that flow through. And then my other question is -- you were talking about sports rights being fairly fixed going forward. Can you talk to us about how Major League Baseball may impact that? And I don't know if that's something you'll quantify. I know you don't -- you haven't officially come out with anything on that, but how we should think about that impacting your outlook if those sports rights costs go up. Thanks.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. For now, Robin, we -- so, we made the decision to give a percentage point uplift in our growth for top and bottom. I think in terms of the revenue performance, as we said, we saw a very nice pickup in ATP, both in absolute terms but also in terms of the mix. And you will see that our sports rights were obviously up. And so, when you think about flow through, there is a correlation there in terms of the sports rights cost and the ramp of the revenue. As we progress through these contracts, obviously, the flow through gets a lot better. And so, you'll see the contribution to margin expansion in the out years. But as we look at it now, it's not -- it was not a high flow through in terms of the -- that you would expect in a more normalized situation. But again, we're giving you an extra point. We're holding the margin. We'll see how we land middle of the year. And yeah, we'll take it from there. But the key point I'd like to reemphasize is we love where our fundamentals are, and we like the way the year is unfolding.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer And to the second part, Robin, MLB, there is nothing to be announced today. But we have -- we are very confident that we can grow and extend our relationship with the MLB in the very soon future. They are very valued partner for us, like many others, NBA, NHL as a sample, or also UEFA. So, we have a very strong portfolio as we said a couple of times. We see nothing material, nothing which is upcoming in the next couple of years, which is not predicted. So, we have a stable portfolio. We can monetize on this. We will always look to the ROI when we invest into new sports rights, and we will execute ruthless on this. So, if we have sports rights where we believe they are contributing to our margin, we will look into this. But the portfolio which we have is long term is very stable, and is big enough that we can deliver the numbers. So, we will do this very selectively with new sports rights but always looking to the return of investment.Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Good morning. This is Stefanos Crist calling in for Bernie. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to ask on the new revenue groups. Could you talk about the difference in incremental margins between the two? Thanks.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer The -- actually, from a margin profile perspective, they're not dramatically different. I think the -- obviously, the difference between the two groupings is the critical masses are core betting. It's data odds, MTS, and there's strong flow through there. The secondary group, which has sports solutions, media, is slightly less, but we do see opportunities to grow those revenue streams in the future, in particular. When we look at advertising, that could improve the overall margin profile over the long term. But right now, yeah, the -- our betting solutions group is obviously a higher margin, but it's not dramatically different.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. And just to follow up, sports betting accelerated in the quarter year over year. You talked about the major drivers, but do you expect revenue to continue to accelerate in your guidance?Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Well, we've given you the guidance, the increase in terms of the extra percentage point. But yes, year over year, I think all the quarters, you're going to see strong growth.Stefanos Crist -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Hey, Carsten, Ger, Jim. Great quarter, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Good luck, Ger. Will miss you. Thanks for the memories, bud. I guess the question is on the U.S. regulatory environment. It certainly looks like the pressure is starting to ramp here. And obviously, Carsten, you've run a global business for a couple of decades here, so I think you have a pretty good view on how regulatory change can sort of creep into mature markets. Obviously, we're far from mature, but we're starting to see a little bit of pressure. Just sort of curious how you think it's going to play out in the U.S., how it could impact your business, and how you're thinking about maybe proactive steps that you can take as a partner with operators and sort of a service to the industry and sort of getting in front, maybe sort of self-correcting and avoiding any potential federal or state oversight more than we have. Thanks, guys.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Michael. So, looking now to the U.S. market regulatory environment and the changes in some states, we see, at the moment, no negative impact on our business. We understand from all our partners that this is a constant process. And if I'm looking now back on all the years I'm in this business, that's quite useful. You need to find your way. You need to find what is the sweet spot, where to go, what are the rules, and the values which are critical for everybody. For example, responsible gaming is very important. Taxation is very important for the states. I'm very confident that we will find here the right way. And as I said, at the moment, there is no negative impact on us. And it's a moderation. It's constant talk with all the players in that market, the sport, the governments, the regulators and, of course, also our partners in the industry. And that's what we are doing. So, I'm very confident that this will continue to develop in the right way. And by the way, as a remark, I was traveling in Brazil three weeks ago having there also many talks with the finance minister, all the sports, which are in there and all the players in the market. It's a pretty similar plot, much more early stage than the U.S., but it takes a while to moderate this to find the best way to satisfy all interest groups.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Nice. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.Unknown speaker Hey, guys. This is [Inaudible] for David Katz. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. There's been an unstated focus on core products. Could you describe how you're thinking about what is core and what isn't, as in what stays and goes and what are the financial implications? Thank you.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Well, we are looking on the product ROI. That's the most important for us. That's where we want to deploy our capital. And so, looking now to the products, you will see a lot of activities around innovative products, which are driven by ingesting massive deep data and creating value for our clients. So, you will see investments from us in that space because they simply deliver the highest return. We will look for our operational leverage like we demonstrated it now in the U.S. marketplace with some properties and content. ATP is a perfect example of how we can use our engine to massively distribute this kind of content. So, we will see some investments there, always with the reminder we are looking to the product ROI if we buy those properties. So, this is our core focus area. Looking now to the whole ecosystem and to broaden it a little bit, it is very exciting to use fan information for marketing activities to generate leads for our clients and, of course, then to create following up the trading services and probability predictions from them for those sports fans. So, we are just closing that circle, using all the information which we have to provide additional value for our clients.Unknown speaker Great, That's all for me. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.Jordan Bender -- JMP Securities -- Analyst Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. There seems to be a lot of positive momentum coming from the NBA. Can you maybe just breakdown some of those factors, the inputs going in there, maybe between increased volume or some of the pricing or even shift in play and how those are kind of translating to some of the positive commentary coming out of that? And then for the follow-up, when we think about the path to your EBITDA margin target of 25%-plus, do you have all the pieces in place today, maybe from even a technology or a footprint base to kind of achieve those targets? Thank you.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I'll take the first part. That's the question with the NBA. It was a hard work during the last 12 months to convince the market with our new NBA contract to get this locked in. As you see in the numbers, we have been very successful with this. Now, it is how can we create value with the enhanced partnership. As you know, we have now deep data from the NBA, and we can use this in product flight foresight or, much more important, in the trading products, in Alpha Odds. So, we get now significantly better real-time information, and we can visualize this. And we have products on all levels. Like we said last time with the lead press, we have now a product that we can put into the live screen to odds directly and stimulate the players. And that's very successful. So, this is something where we see a huge potential in the future. I could speak hours about this. But looking now forward for the next couple of years, there is a lot of leverage what we can unlock with the NBA as being one of the premium sports properties in the U.S.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer In terms of thinking about the operating leverage, all the ingredients are -- they're effectively in the building, and there's a little bit of timing here. When you look at our core execution in 2024, it's all about continuing to drive the core product offering and recurring revenue streams and then layering in ATP, NBA and the run rate benefits of other clients like the Taiwanese lottery. As you go into '25 and '26, it continues to focus on driving the core growth. From an investment point of view, continuing to enhance our product portfolio, whether it's rationalizing based on ROI, as Carsten said, our core that we have today, layering in new products like Alpha Odds and emBET and continuing to bring additional products to market driven off deep data and other technology innovations. So, that's all embedded into the overall operating model. And as I said earlier, as long as we maintain our focus on the level of growth that you see in our people costs, as we continue to invest in our teams and all other operating spend, and we continue to drive what is a more stable sports rights base, yes, we'll add to it, but not the same material that you saw in '24. Then you will start to see the points of margin flow through to the P&L. TBD how long it will take us to get to the ultimate goal of 25%, 30%. But it's not that far away.Jordan Bender -- JMP Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Ger, and best of luck.Ger Griffin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.Jim Bombassei -- Head of Investor Relations Michelle, we'll take our last question.OperatorThank you. Our last question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about pricing. Just as we think about the contracts and the new NBA contract, my question is simply, do we see an increase in pricing that is kind of a one-time movement, i.e. are you changing the contractual rates with your customers that move up and is going to be recognized as sort of the data as we see the data rights come in, or is a little bit more -- is everything more revenue share, and that'll kind of -- so we should see continued commensurate growth of what we're seeing now as we move out into the latter part of the year and more into 2025? Thanks.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Hi, Shaun. So, this is Carsten. The core thing here is looking now to the existing model, which we have in the U.S., its revenue share as we all know. So, we will grow with the market for the existing product. I think it will never work to overstretch the pricing. We're going to need to create value with innovative solutions, which are providing that value back for our clients. Alpha Odds is a perfect example, so we can simply generate higher profits. Then our clients can do this with ingesting more data into the engine and helping them to uplift it. So, that's the way where we see a lot of growth potential. Foresight is a sample where we can use NBA. We are working here with the League Pass. To give you a number on the League Pass for the more than 600 matches which we played out there with the solution, we had an engagement rate of 3.7%, meaning 3.7% of all the people, which had seen this going into a transaction. This is, from a marketing purpose or marketing view, a sensational rate. Usually, the rate is significantly lower than 1%. That sees a 300% uplift for the users of the League Pass and for the operator who is providing the odds here. That's generating pure value for all the players. This is very powerful. Looking now into, yes, we have a good situation. We are sitting on three of the big four leagues in the U.S. with, by far, the biggest client base and distribution base there. We can leverage a little bit on the pricing, but our core focus is to create value with new products, which I mentioned a few of them.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks, Carsten. And then my follow-up would just be on Brazil. You obviously mentioned this. And what's the experience when a new -- a significant new market like this opens up or moves into regulatory. Are you already in Brazil or should we expect a bigger step function as you're able to do deals with maybe operators that you haven't done deals with before? Thanks.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer I was personally there, Shaun, three weeks ago. So, the experience was interesting with five bodyguards in Sao Paulo, which we had there on the ground. It's a wide market. It's a very exciting market. By the way, it was not necessary, all these security measurements, which have been there. Very friendly environment, people which are very passionate about the sport. Main sport there is, as we all know, soccer. A lot of development opportunities, a lot of activities. The federal government licensed or liberalized sports betting in December. So, in June, we will see now a process starting that the first operators get official license, generate taxes for the state. And it was very important for me to speak there with all stakeholders, finance ministry, speaking with the sport, with representatives from the club and from the leagues which are there. And then, of course, speaking with the operators, the foreign operators and the local operators, which are their boots on the ground. Understanding their needs is essential to create the right setup. We have a people team down there. Already, we have a legal setup there, and we are investing in that market opportunity. Looking from a size perspective, we believe that this is growing from a 2 billion GGR to round about 5 billion to 6 billion in the next three years. It's early days, as I said, and we are coming up with a complete strategy. But we are very interested to expand our footprint in Brazil and to use this growth opportunity.Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you, everyone. And good luck, Ger. Appreciate the time.Carsten Koerl -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.Jim Bombassei -- Head of Investor Relations We want to thank everyone for joining our earnings call.

      "Home Depot (HD 0.43%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 9:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGreetings, and welcome to the Home Depot first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.Isabel Janci -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's first-quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, chair, president, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, senior executive vice president; Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising; and Richard McPhail, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted. Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $36.4 billion, down 2.3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 2.8% from the same period last year. Our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.63 in the first quarter, compared to $3.82 in the first quarter last year. The team executed a high level in the quarter, continued to grow market share. While the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, product assortment, and associate engagement. Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. In addition, our focus remains on creating the best interconnected experience, growing Pro wallet share with a differentiated set of capabilities and building new stores. Driving sales growth with our Pro customers remains one of our top focus areas. Remember, we operate in a $45 trillion asset class, which represents the installed base of homes in the United States. And we serve a highly fragmented addressable market of approximately $1 trillion. Within that TAM, the greatest opportunity is with the residential Pro contractor who shops across many categories of home improvement products while working on complex projects. We've defined that specific opportunity as an approximately $250 billion TAM, of which we have relatively little share today. We also know that to effectively serve this TAM, we need an expanded set of capabilities and services that we referred to as our Pro ecosystem. And while the store remains the center of that ecosystem, we are developing more fulfillment options, a dedicated sales force, specific digital assets, trade credit, and order management capabilities geared at the residential Pro to shops across categories. As we've shared with you before, our more mature markets with this Pro ecosystem have seen great success, so we're expanding to other markets. As you heard last quarter, we'll have the foundational elements of our ecosystem in 17 markets by the end of the fiscal year. And while these 17 markets are currently at different maturity levels, they are outperforming our other large Pro markets in aggregate. Earlier this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire SRS, a residential specialty trade distributor with a leading position in three large, highly fragmented specialty trade verticals serving the roofer, the pool contractor, and the landscape professional. SRS is complementary to the ecosystem we've been building, giving us another avenue to more effectively serve the complex project occasion. They also give us the right to win with specialty trade Pro customer. SRS does an exceptional job serving the specialty trade Pro who typically only shops one category and needs specialized capabilities to complete their project. In addition, SRS is an exceptionally well-run business with a world-class management team. As we build out our own ecosystem, we can leverage their expertise in deep product catalog in the verticals in which they operate. We have significant growth opportunities in front of us, and we are very happy with the operational execution in our core business. And despite pressure in the market, we continue to invest in our business. We are gaining share of wallet with our customers whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets, or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store MET teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment. They did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.Ann-Marie Campbell -- Executive Vice President, U.S. Stores and International Operations Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As we head into a bigger selling season, our associates continue to be engaged, excited, and ready to serve our customers. As Ted mentioned, growing share of wallet with the Pro and winning the pros working on complex projects continues to be our largest growth opportunity. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our Pro sales teams and capabilities. We have developed new capabilities within our Pro intelligence tool which feeds our CRM platform and leverages data science to bring better insight to our sales teams. These tools are helping us to both assist in identifying the optimal Pro target in a market as well as the highest value cross-selling opportunities to drive action and sales. Another critical component of the shopping experience is being in stock with the right products and ensuring those products are on shelf and available for sale. We've talked to you before about Sidekick and Computer Vision and are thrilled with the results we've seen so far. This year, we will continue to lean in to improve our OSA and drive productivity by creating consistent, actionable, and directed task for our associates. What's really exciting is how we are also now leveraging Computer Vision for other applications across the store. For example, Computer Vision helps us maintain the integrity of our base by ensuring that the products on the shelf meets our quality standards. Maintaining high-quality, damage-free product is a key component of delivery on the customer experience. Additionally, we have also deployed this technology in our self-checkout corral to help us mitigate shrink. Computer Vision can identify complex carts or high-value carts and signal the cashier to help the customer with their basket to ensure all products are scanned and accounted for. While we will continue to improve upon all of these technology-enabled applications, we are thrilled with the early results we are seeing. Last quarter, we talked with you about one of our areas of opportunity within our post-sale experience, specifically within our returns process. I'm excited to update you that over 70% of online orders are now able to be self-service returns from their My Account profile on our website. Now, our customers can create their own return of an online order and drop it off at a UPS with a scan of a barcode. Later this year, we will enable job site pickup or returns back to our FDC, which will be a game changer for Pro shopping experience. This enhancement will allow our customers, primarily the residential Pro, to initiate a return from their job site versus having to return big and bulky items to the store. This is a massive win, not only for pros, but also for associates and/or stores and will drive better customer satisfaction and greater store productivity. These initiatives are just a few examples of the different ways we are improving the shopping experience for customers and/or associates. I am so excited about all we are doing to drive sales in our stores, and I look forward to the opportunity that's ahead of us. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates. And I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, our sales were impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects. However, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. Before providing commentary on our comp performance, it's important to note that we made some merchandising department changes to more closely reflect our customers shopper categories and better align with our merchandising growth efforts. We now have 16 departments up from 14 previously and have separated electrical and lighting and kitchen and bath. Additionally, we have renamed our tools department to power and included outdoor power equipment to capture synergies and maximize the strength of our battery-powered platforms. Turning to our department comp performance for the first quarter. Our building materials and power departments posted positive comps, while outdoor garden, paint, lumber, plumbing, and hardware were all above the company average. During the first quarter, our comp transactions decreased 1.5%, and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the projects such as kitchen and bath remodels. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. We are incredibly focused on removing friction for our customers to create an excellent interconnected shopping experience. We continue to work on improving our online search functionality and serving the most relevant product offerings to our customers. To do this, we rolled out an intent-based search engine that combines keywords, behaviors, and intent to deliver more targeted results. And we enhanced our filtering capabilities, improving the customer's ability to find exactly what they are looking for. All of these initiatives work together to drive strong results in our online business. Pro and DIY customers performance was relatively in line with one another, but both were negative for the quarter. While Pro backlogs remain relatively stable, we hear from our pros that homeowners continue to take on smaller projects. The investments we are making are resonating with our pros as we see increased engagement. For example, we have made significant progress with the Pro who paints and continue to see share gains with this customer. Our partnerships with BEHR and PPG, as well as enhanced capabilities around their in-store service and job site delivery capabilities, are helping to remove friction from their experience. During the end of the first quarter, we hosted our annual Spring Black Friday and spring gift center events and saw strong performance across both events. Our merchants did a fantastic job curating the best products, and we saw strong engagement with our customers throughout the event. We are pleased with the results we saw, particularly in categories like riding lawn mowers and outdoor power equipment, where we had experienced some discretionary pull forward over the last couple of years. The trend away from gas to battery-powered products is continuing, and we are well positioned with our assortment. We have the brands our customers are looking for, whether it's RYOBI, Milwaukee, DEWALT, Makita, or RIDGID. We estimate that there are nearly 500 million batteries in the market today, and our assortment covers the vast majority of these batteries. In fact, more than 70% of batteries with brands that are exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel. With hundreds of products across each of these platforms, this is one of the best loyalty programs that keeps customers coming back to The Home Depot. And our live goods category looks incredible. We are ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables for every type of gardener. We're excited about spring breaking across the country, and we remain ready to help our customers with all of their outdoor projects and outdoor living needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $36.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 2.3% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were negative 2.8% with comps of negative 4% in February, negative 0.8% in March and negative 3.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were negative 3.2% for the quarter with comps of negative 4.8% in February, negative 1.3% in March, and negative 3.6% in April. For the quarter, Mexico posted positive comps, whereas Canada was slightly below the company average. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, an increase of approximately 45 basis points from the first quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation cost and shrink. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 140 basis points to 20.2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a benefit from a legal settlement that we are overlapping from the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as deleverage from our top-line results. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.9%, compared to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the first quarter decreased by $13 million to $428 million. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.6%, compared to 24.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.63, a decrease of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,337. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.4 billion, down approximately $3 billion or 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.5 times, up from 3.9 times last year. Turning to capital allocation. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $850 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As a reminder, in March, we announced our intent to acquire SRS Distribution, and as a result, we paused share repurchases. As you've heard us say many times, we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and that is not changing. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend, and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. From time to time, we will also invest in the business through acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and to accelerate our strategic objectives. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 37.1% down from 43.6% -- excuse me, down from 43.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2024. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our guidance does not currently reflect any impact from the announced acquisition of SRS. The acquisition is currently under regulatory review, and we expect it to close by the end of fiscal 2024. We expect total sales growth to outpace sales comp with sales growth of approximately positive 1% and comp sales of approximately negative 1%. Total sales growth will benefit from a 53rd week, and we expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. We expect operating margin of approximately 14.1%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and our diluted earnings per share percent growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023. It is our intent to update guidance as appropriate once the SRS transaction closes. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model.

Thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Christine, we are now ready for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about how the -- how you think the bathtub effect could play out? Do you have a sense of how much maybe the weather was a net headwind year over year, understanding that last spring was also wonky? And related to that, Billy mentioned being pleased with spring where the weather was good and some positive commentary and some early COVID-winning categories. So, where there was normal weather, did you see comps maybe get flat or even -- or maybe up around the spring business? Thanks.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Hey, good morning, Chris, wonky is a great word to describe this spring. We can't really point to one geography that has had consistently good weather. But yes, certain markets, particularly in some of the Northern most markets where we've had some good weekends, business was just incredible. And that's really what powered the positive comp in our power business. A lot of that is driven by outdoor power equipment. We talk a lot about the battery platforms and the brands we have, and customers are really responding to that category. But we just haven't had the consistent weather across the country. We were looking for much improved Western division this year given how bad weather was last year in the West, but that really didn't happen. So, the bathtub is in effect, but we still have a long way to go. Our biggest selling weeks are ahead of us and certainly hope for some drier weather in sunnier days. But, Billy, maybe you can add some commentary.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. No, thanks for the question, Chris. And as Ted mentioned, I mean, if you go back and we knew that there was pull forward in a lot of discretionary categories, single item purchases, if you will. And we're really pleased to see some of those businesses more normalize to the cyclical cycle of what you would typically see. And there's no question that that was -- had been an impact certainly last year, and so really pleased with seeing some of that. Yes, where the weather has been great, which hasn't been or consistent, I should say, we've seen great customer engagement. I mentioned our spring Black Friday event, our spring gift center events. We've seen great consumer customer engagement there. And there's still the continued pressure that we see in finance big projects as they called out in kitchen and bath, specifically in the kind of remodeling finance projects. But really pleased with some of the customer engagement, some of those pull-forward categories so far.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst And just to dig in on that a little bit on the big-ticket sort of two sides of the coin, is the big-ticket finance project business did it get worse because rates spiked in on the other side, categories like garden equipment and grills and patio, are you seeing any emergence of replacement cycle where you could see maybe those categories start to get back to flat, if not up?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Chris, this is Richard. So, just from a year-over-year perspective, we saw big-ticket pressure last Q1, which was more of the item purchase as customers deferred those sort of item purchases. We saw big-ticket pressure this Q1 as well and yet the dynamic has changed, and the dynamic really that we began to see toward the back half of last year was this deferral of large projects like Billy called out. So, the pressure in those categories has actually increased. It's a different story of Q1 2023 versus 2024. And maybe, Billy, you talked about particular categories.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. Again, the kitchen and bath remodel project cabinets and so forth, I mean, anything that's financed, we continue to see even a little bit more pressure. Conversely, and you just mentioned, Chris, some of the categories more item buying. I mean, the category like riding mower is well over $1,000 purchase, and we're seeing just in a few categories like that, terrific customer engagement. Again, we had pulled forward, but we're really pleased with some of those specific item purchases even the ones that are over $1,000, as I mentioned, riding mowers and some other categories where we've seen really back to that cyclical customer engagement. We're really pleased with some of those pieces that we're seeing in the business.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks very much. Have a great rest of spring.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Chris.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, everyone. My first is a macro, and I'm going to follow-up with a micro. I want to ask your opinion on lock-in effect versus turnover. If it's clear that we need turnover now for stronger demand, and if you can talk about demand in regions of the country where pricing is more noticeably going up than others seeing if there is a real lock-in effect that can happen. And the contingency is if we don't get rate decreases, what sort of normal could look like?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer So, Simeon, I think you have to think about this short term and longer term. So, if we think about lock-in effect and the impact of housing turnover. Clearly, we've seen two years of significant decrease in housing turnover to the point where we're at really sort of at historical lows. And most folks think that that can't get much lower. When you're thinking about current performance, obviously, that puts pressure on our business. When a customer buys or sells a home, they spend more in that year than in a year when they don't. And so, there's no doubt that we're missing some of that project demand, and that's what's going on our sales as we had anticipated. Then you have to ask yourself though, the lock-in effect, the interest rate environment, at this point, a lot of subject to the macro. I think the question is at what point current interest rates become sort of the new normal. This is not something that we're making a prediction on. It's just thinking about behavior. At some point, spend on housing shifts from discretionary to something that you simply must do. We know that there's pent-up demand for household formation. And so, again, I'd say short term, it is having an impact on our customers' mindset. And it's not just housing turnover-related spend. It's really all large projects. As Billy said, sort of debt finance spend where we are seeing interest rates sort of weigh on the mind of customers. And look, we're not immune to this. If you look at the national figures on what's really driving the consumer right now, its services. Goods are underperforming services, and durable goods are seeing the most pressure and, in particular, home-related categories. So, this is not a surprise and this is baked into our expectations for the year. The question will be how it evolves over time.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks. That's helpful, Richard. My follow-up, transaction is still negative, but on a stack, it looks like they're getting a little better if we're not overreading it, and that's despite the spring weather not breaking yet. So, if you look at your transactions on an improving trend line, is that industry bottoming, getting better, or is that Home Depot taking share?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, those are challenging to tease out. I would say our sense is we are taking share. That's from third-party reporting on 4441, but transactions, I think you have two dynamics going on, and they relate to your prior question, Simeon. We've talked about the COVID and the lap of the COVID it is sort of like the giant storm and the hurricane. And for a couple of years, after you pulled so much demand forward, you suffer from lower sales in those categories. And that's what we were talking about last year and when Billy was just reviewing this item buying, there was no doubt, grills and riders and patio sets, these big-ticket items were pulled forward. We're seeing now that sort of naturally lap sort of like that hurricane effect lapping. What is newer, and we chatted about this before, is the housing turnover, which while historically not a huge driver of demand, it's steady state demand as housing turnover is fairly steady. But in the last 18-odd months is that has dropped from over 6 million units a year. I think at some run rates in certain months, it was even under 4 million. That dramatic decrease in housing activity is sort of the newer hurricane, if you will. And we don't see that going much lower. It's hard to predict, but as Richard said, tough to call the macro. But at some point, people will start to lap the interest rates and the lock-in effect. We've already seen percentages of houses with mortgages and all the various interest rate strata the percentage that we're in that under 3.5% is past peak. So, you're already starting to see a bit of an unlock there. But all of that then leads to your transaction question. So, we are starting to see some increase in transaction as we're lapping more of the COVID pull forward, some newer pressure with the housing turnover dynamic. But net-net, we like the trend of transactions in units per basket were also up, and we like seeing that trend as well. So, not unexpected, as Richard said, and all baked into our guidance for 2024.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer And just to add to that, you think about how we're performing in spite of large projects, having seen the pressure, if you just look at debt financing and you look at some of the statistics around where we're sitting, HELOC withdrawals or HELOC borrowings, down 23% year over year. That's a Q4 statistic, but I think we're in the same territory in Q1. In dollars, that's dropping somewhere from 70 billion-ish a quarter to 50 billion-ish a quarter. And you look at cash out refinancing down 14% year over year, in dollars this peaked around $80 billion, and they were $17 billion last quarter. And so, you've got a significant drop, more than 75% from peak to where we are today. And so, that's to us, interesting context for the fact that transactions have actually begun to recover on a sequential basis. So, we're punching through the environment. But in some respects, as Ted said, the macro has been against us for a little while now. And you could almost say those statistics are stabilizing at least on the bottom.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks. Good luck.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning, and thank you. I want to start with a clarification on the outlook. You've got 1% EPS growth. I just want to confirm that this incorporates the buyback pause post Q1. And then second, transaction growth stepping in the right direction. Curious if this was more Pro or DIY driven or both? And any color on the health of small and midsized pros versus larger Pros?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Great. So, Zach, I'll take the first part. It's Richard. So, look, as we have reiterated guidance and see no reason to do anything about that. And when you think about the pause in share repurchases, think about the fact that we're also accumulating cash. As we accumulate cash, we earn interest on that cash. You'll see on our balance sheet, we have over $4 billion in cash right now, which is around $3 billion higher than last year. So, given where short-term interest rates are, that interest income is a really strong offset to the impact from pause share repurchases and therefore, the net of it wouldn't change our guidance.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And on the Pro/DIY, each were negative for the quarter, more or less the same rate. And within Pro, the larger Pro continues to outperform particularly those engaging in the ecosystem. I'll let Chip comment more about our performance there.Chip Devine -- Senior Vice President, Outside Sales Yes. Thanks, Zach. Where we've expanded our capabilities around our supply chain capabilities and the expansion of our outside sales teams, we've seen noticeable outperformance in those markets and positive comps. So, very pleased with that margin of expansion. And as we move into this next nine months, we'll expand in another three FTC markets that we've mentioned, one in LA, one in Detroit, and one in San Antonio. So, we're very pleased with our progress.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. Appreciate the color. And then, Richard, quickly, it looks like your SG&A on a per-store basis was about flat year over year when you exclude the legal impact. And I'm curious if this is the right way to think about productivity this year or if you have any other levers at your disposal through the year.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Well, look, again, I would encourage you to look at our full-year guidance because operating expense management can vary quarter to quarter. Obviously, we wanted to make sure that we were fully staffed in our stores. And as we said, we had a little bit later start to spring than we would have liked. And so -- but we wanted to make sure that we were right there in front of our customer. We had other favorability. I mean, hats off to all our teams driving productivity throughout the portfolio, but in that particular point, operating expense is controlled by our operations team just did a fantastic job landing the quarter. And that's all baked into the reaffirmation of guidance.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thanks so much for the time.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Good morning, guys. The scope of the answer here might be a little beyond this conversation. But in general, can you talk about how you plan to utilize SRS and their discrete set of Pro relationships to potentially leverage your broader complex Pro initiatives?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Scott. First and foremost, SRS is just a great company operating in three large, highly fragmented markets. So, we talked about our TAM being $950 billion at the investor conference. With SRS in their market of roofing, specialty trade, pool, and landscape, that opens up $50 billion increased TAM were they are a strong number two in each of those segments. So, just a well-run company in three great growth markets where they have strong share positions. So, first and foremost, you get capability that lets you engage and win in a completely new TAM. How it's complementary to what we're doing, all the things that we are building, they have as a distributor. We've been a retailer for 45 years, and we're building wholesale capability, things like trade credit, things like much more robust on time and complete delivery to job sites, things like order management, things like incentivized field sales forces. So, these are all things that they've done for years, and we look forward to being able to engage with them and learn from them. But then they can also serve our customers. I mean, our customers will benefit from their deep, broad catalogs in those verticals, and we can cross-sell their product into our residential focused Pro customer. So, we look at this as just a great opportunity to expand market, to expand capabilities, and to better service our customers.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Very helpful. And then just, hopefully, a quickie. You talked about being in 17 markets by end of the year for the complex Pro capabilities. How many markets do you ultimately see that capability rolled out to its 17 going to X.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I mean, we would expect to -- over time, to be in -- we often talk about the top 40, kind of 80-20 rule of demand in our space, and that would be the expectation.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. In light of the start to the year, have you -- did you give any internal discussions to moderating your expectation around the way the rest of the year could unfold especially in light of what's likely to be now fewer rate cuts than was expected 90 days ago, which may mean that the overall rate of home improvement, the market may see less of an acceleration from here?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Michael, we're not Fed watchers here necessarily. And we said at the beginning of this year that we had a neutral stance on housing. We weren't going to take a bet on cuts or how many cuts. And that hasn't changed. What we are focused on and what our internal discussions do evolve around is our level of execution in the core business. And as I said, we couldn't be happier with how engaged this team is and how well we executed during the quarter. And if I can just take a minute to rattle off a few of these telltales, when you think what Hector has done in the stores, in terms of shrink, in leveraging our wage investments to getting attrition way down, which is helping with safety instances, what we're doing with technology and process in the store that Ann mentioned in her remarks about not just the better in-stock but the supply chain is delivering, but the actual on-shelf availability that all our tools are delivering, our supply chain and merchant teams, what an incredible job. In the face of negative comps, they took out $3 billion of inventory at cost, increased our turnover 60 basis points to 4.5 times, and increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels. I mean, that is just incredible performance. And then add our price position. We talked about prices having settled in the marketplace. We're not any more promotional this year, but our overall price position with that roller coaster that we experienced during the COVID years, we're as well positioned on price and value and innovative products as we've been in some time. And then productivity in general remains a flywheel, The Home Depot. And a lot of that SG&A leverage that you noticed, and we delivered was the efficiency in the model in having executed that 500 million in cost out that we signaled at the end of last year. So, Michael, that's what we focus on internally is controlling what we can control, and that's why I'm just so pleased with this team and their high level of execution in the quarter.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you for that, Ted. My follow-up is, there is a school of thought out there that the SRS acquisition could be assigned to Home Depot's efforts to address the complex Pro segment of the market has just proved to be a little bit more difficult than what was originally expected. How would you respond to that?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, I'd respond to say what we are doing to capture Pro share of wallet with wholesale distribution capabilities is challenging, which is why no one's done it before. But we are doing it, and we are succeeding in it and we like what we see, and that's why we continue to roll out to additional markets. We also know it's a journey. This isn't open up a DC, building a physical DC is about the simplest thing for us to do in our whole ecosystem that we're building. But it is putting together all the pieces of the ecosystem and introducing our customers to those capabilities. And as we've said before, as we introduce customers to the capabilities, it is a linear relationship between increased comp and increased engagement with those capabilities. So, we're still optimistic in green and progressing on our organic efforts. SRS really is a completely different discussion in that a terrific asset and management team was brought to our attention that opened up a specialty distribution TAM that they have just a terrific position in. So, at the end of the day, we keep reminding ourselves that we service a $45 trillion asset class with a $1 trillion TAM with The Home Depot at only about $150 billion in sales. We have so much share to gain with our consumers, in-store, online shopping with our existing Pros who largely shop our stores with this complex purchase occasion with larger Pros that we're building out the ecosystem. And now, SRS gives us a whole new white space to go play in three other verticals to take even more share. So, very, very different propositions.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you very much, and good luck.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot. Curious on the DIY side. Have you seen any changes in spending between income cohorts? And as a follow-up, you spoke to the delayed start to spring. Curious, a few weeks here into the month of May. Maybe you could frame out how business is tracking relative to the first quarter or April?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer So, on the income cohorts, it's actually really more about project size than it is about income cohort right now. And as I said, the -- as we said, the majority of the demand pressure is in those larger projects. And that really sort of spreads itself across cohorts, you could even say that, that almost tends to show as pressure in higher-income cohorts. As we said before, though, this seems to be is it's not the inability to fund projects, it's a deferral mindset. You have this odd irony of every sound bite you read. Well, interest rates are going -- they're coming down soon. Our customers tell us, hey, with that in mind, with that on the horizon, we're just going to wait. And so, that's really the most important dynamic from an income perspective.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. And then, Chuck, just on the first couple of weeks of May. I mean, it really has been the same story where weather has been favorable. We've seen great customer engagement strengthen outdoor projects, really pleased with what we've seen for the weather has been favorable, which is my prepared remarks, the same kind of dynamic we saw through, especially later in the quarter as the weather got a little bit better in certain parts of the country.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst OK. Thanks very much. And then, Richard, one for you. Just you spoke to confirming the 33.9% gross margin rate for the year. Is there anything today that makes you feel better or maybe worse about the underlying assumptions that got you there 90 days ago in terms of shrink, transportation mix?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer I think, we're -- so, we're executing on all cylinders. And from a transportation perspective, from the merchants managing retail and costs through one of the most volatile periods last year in our history, fantastic results. And then just to add to it, look, with respect to shrink, shrink is a problem for retail, organized retail crime is not going away it's a problem for all of us. The external environment is only getting tougher. As a result, we've done a tremendous amount of work. It is amazing, the effort put forth by our teams in making investments that pay off with significant return on investment. And so, when we look at our shrink performance, I hate to say this, but the external environment is not helping. Our teams are succeeding in blunting the impact. It's still a problem, it's still a pressure in our P&L. We want to keep attacking it, but we know that we've got the best in the business facing it. And it's not only a return on investment in terms of financial performance, it's a return on investment from a customer and associate safety perspective. And so, we're really happy about that. I think that there's one dynamic. You asked about margin. There's a dynamic here that I think it's worth calling out when you think about the shape of the year, and so I'll just go there. It is not insignificant when you think about the price dynamic last year and how we saw retail settle in the market during the first half of 2023 and then essentially become what we would call settled during the second half of 2023, which has continued into Q1 and Q2 of this year. So, when you think about the AUR pressure within ticket, we reported ticket in spite of AUR pressure that is in essence about 2 percentage points this quarter year over year. And what I want to remind you of is that's a year-over-year comparison. So, we had kind of the height of -- well, let's put it in a different way. We had a lot of retail and cost settling during the first half of the year. So, that 2% pressure is an artifact of a year-over-year measurement. It is not an observation on where -- what prices are doing today, and they're relatively steady. As we move through the year, that pressure have from Q1 to Q2, so you'll have about 1 percentage point of pressure in Q2, it'll have again in Q3 and then, in essence, be going in Q4. So, you asked the question about margin. I think that is a point with respect to shape of the year that is important to put out there.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much, Richard.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to follow-up on Michael Lasser's question. Can you just help us understand what drives the second-half improvement in same-store sales, just given the fact that the first half has been a little bit softer here with this delayed start to spring?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Well, the primary factor is actually AUR, which we just outlined. So, if you think about pressure going from the beginning of the year in Q1 of 2 percentage points to sort of falling to zero by the end of the year, that's really the majority of the arithmetic with respect to the year.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst OK. And then to follow up on gross margin, maybe it's a question for Billy. Spring Black Friday did well. We did notice there was a new spring sale from an online-only competitor. Do you think the promotional environment is changing at all, I guess, especially on the DIY side of the business as you try to compete for that customer?Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yes. So, I'll speak to the promotional piece and thanks for the question. Listen, it's -- we're in a very rational market. And it's important to note that when we do events, we do events to drive excitement, to drive foot traffic in certain times of the year, no different than most folks do a Black Friday event, but we're doing that to drive excitement, bring value to the marketplace. We're not putting stuff, posting stuff on sale. The promotional business as it stands today in 2024 looks exactly like it did pre-COVID and before. It's no different. In fact, we've talked about appliances a little bit, but the environment really is normalized to what it was pre-COVID. And I think it's, again, important to note that we do that to drive excitement footsteps and absolutely try to bring value to our customers at these key times of the selling year.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thanks for the detail.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question -- and I apologize. I know this is going to be a bit repetitive to at least a couple of the prior questions. But so, I may ask it a little bit different way. As you look at -- today, you reiterated guidance for 2024. As you think about what we see would transpire so to say in Q1. We talked a lot through the call about the macro pressures. The macro disruption is still impacting Home Depot. So, the question I have is to get to that guidance, the guidance you've reiterated today, do you need some type of change, some type of solidification in the macro environment from what you're seeing today?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer This -- no, Brian. Really, the only impact here was a delayed spring, and we manage this business in halves. And no matter when spring comes, it always comes, and it never impacts our annual results or guidance. So, that's why we reaffirm today.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. Then my second question, look, this with some of the macro data, and there's more chatter out there about a potential reemergence, if you will, of inflationary pressures. So, I guess the question for you is, I mean, within your business, particularly maybe more the commodity side of this, are you starting to see this, A? And then, B, as you think about to the extent that we are seeing some type -- potentially some type of reemergence of inflation, how do you view at this juncture, the ability of Home Depot to pass those type of costs along to consumers as it has in the past?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer If you look at the national statistics and you actually parse inflation, inflation is being driven in the goods space -- sorry, the services space, not in the goods space and particularly not in home-related categories, Billy, maybe just talk about observations.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. And from a commodity standpoint, Brian, we've seen no impact. Obviously, we talked a lot in the last year about not only lumber, but copper, and we're pleased with the fact that there's no impact on commodities at this point and see a very stable environment.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Good. Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.Isabel Janci -- Vice President, Investor Relations Christine, we have time for one more question.OperatorThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I was hoping maybe to just expand on the weakness in certain discretionary projects such as kitchen and bath. Any way to help us better understand if there's line of sight to stabilization in the project size headwind this year and/or pressure rolling off? Meaning, is it cycling compares still? Or are you still seeing project size moderate, right, relative to some baseline, whether it's a year ago or sort of from peak levels?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's -- I mean, for sure, the single biggest pressure outside of the AUR that Richard went through was from discretionary larger decor-oriented projects. And as we've said, last year, it was more of an item story. This year, it's more of a discretionary generally finance story. If you take something like kitchen cabinets in countertops, I mean, those are probably the only categories where we've seen not just some falloff in projects and size of projects, but actually a little bit of trading down. So, it's focused on those categories. That's the only place we've seen it and are seeing it. That too will pass. I mean, I think that is now going through -- there's -- we've always had the idea that if turnover would drop, people would improve in place. I think we're still seeing the fallout from the turnover being down so dramatically. I mean, it was just six months ago that interest rates hit their peak in October of 2023 mortgage rates. So, those are the type of projects when you move into a new house, you update your kitchen, you update a master bathroom, etc. And then if you are going to stay in place and take on those type of projects outside of a move, you're generally going to finance. And as we've seen the rates tick up and the impact of rates ticking up, that's impacting that demand. So, right now, you would see a lap of that dynamic. We don't see housing turnover going lower. And then the question is interest rates. What does happen to interest rates in higher for longer? What does that mean, you guys know as much as we do on that score?Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think it was Chip's comments earlier about the Pro comp, right, being positive. I believe you said within those markets that are servicing the Complex Pro, so maybe just clarifying if that's what he said. And does that imply that you've seen a widening in the performance gap between those markets where you're servicing the complex Pro versus the company average, maybe relative to what you guys stated at the analyst day last year?Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yes. Just reaffirming what I said, we have seen positive comps in those markets where we've invested in sales professionals and our FTC markets.Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Great.

      "Home Depot (HD 0.43%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 9:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGreetings, and welcome to the Home Depot first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.Isabel Janci -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's first-quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, chair, president, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, senior executive vice president; Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising; and Richard McPhail, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted. Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $36.4 billion, down 2.3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 2.8% from the same period last year. Our U.S. stores had negative comps of 3.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.63 in the first quarter, compared to $3.82 in the first quarter last year. The team executed a high level in the quarter, continued to grow market share. While the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, product assortment, and associate engagement. Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. In addition, our focus remains on creating the best interconnected experience, growing Pro wallet share with a differentiated set of capabilities and building new stores. Driving sales growth with our Pro customers remains one of our top focus areas. Remember, we operate in a $45 trillion asset class, which represents the installed base of homes in the United States. And we serve a highly fragmented addressable market of approximately $1 trillion. Within that TAM, the greatest opportunity is with the residential Pro contractor who shops across many categories of home improvement products while working on complex projects. We've defined that specific opportunity as an approximately $250 billion TAM, of which we have relatively little share today. We also know that to effectively serve this TAM, we need an expanded set of capabilities and services that we referred to as our Pro ecosystem. And while the store remains the center of that ecosystem, we are developing more fulfillment options, a dedicated sales force, specific digital assets, trade credit, and order management capabilities geared at the residential Pro to shops across categories. As we've shared with you before, our more mature markets with this Pro ecosystem have seen great success, so we're expanding to other markets. As you heard last quarter, we'll have the foundational elements of our ecosystem in 17 markets by the end of the fiscal year. And while these 17 markets are currently at different maturity levels, they are outperforming our other large Pro markets in aggregate. Earlier this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire SRS, a residential specialty trade distributor with a leading position in three large, highly fragmented specialty trade verticals serving the roofer, the pool contractor, and the landscape professional. SRS is complementary to the ecosystem we've been building, giving us another avenue to more effectively serve the complex project occasion. They also give us the right to win with specialty trade Pro customer. SRS does an exceptional job serving the specialty trade Pro who typically only shops one category and needs specialized capabilities to complete their project. In addition, SRS is an exceptionally well-run business with a world-class management team. As we build out our own ecosystem, we can leverage their expertise in deep product catalog in the verticals in which they operate. We have significant growth opportunities in front of us, and we are very happy with the operational execution in our core business. And despite pressure in the market, we continue to invest in our business. We are gaining share of wallet with our customers whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets, or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store MET teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment. They did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.Ann-Marie Campbell -- Executive Vice President, U.S. Stores and International Operations Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As we head into a bigger selling season, our associates continue to be engaged, excited, and ready to serve our customers. As Ted mentioned, growing share of wallet with the Pro and winning the pros working on complex projects continues to be our largest growth opportunity. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our Pro sales teams and capabilities. We have developed new capabilities within our Pro intelligence tool which feeds our CRM platform and leverages data science to bring better insight to our sales teams. These tools are helping us to both assist in identifying the optimal Pro target in a market as well as the highest value cross-selling opportunities to drive action and sales. Another critical component of the shopping experience is being in stock with the right products and ensuring those products are on shelf and available for sale. We've talked to you before about Sidekick and Computer Vision and are thrilled with the results we've seen so far. This year, we will continue to lean in to improve our OSA and drive productivity by creating consistent, actionable, and directed task for our associates. What's really exciting is how we are also now leveraging Computer Vision for other applications across the store. For example, Computer Vision helps us maintain the integrity of our base by ensuring that the products on the shelf meets our quality standards. Maintaining high-quality, damage-free product is a key component of delivery on the customer experience. Additionally, we have also deployed this technology in our self-checkout corral to help us mitigate shrink. Computer Vision can identify complex carts or high-value carts and signal the cashier to help the customer with their basket to ensure all products are scanned and accounted for. While we will continue to improve upon all of these technology-enabled applications, we are thrilled with the early results we are seeing. Last quarter, we talked with you about one of our areas of opportunity within our post-sale experience, specifically within our returns process. I'm excited to update you that over 70% of online orders are now able to be self-service returns from their My Account profile on our website. Now, our customers can create their own return of an online order and drop it off at a UPS with a scan of a barcode. Later this year, we will enable job site pickup or returns back to our FDC, which will be a game changer for Pro shopping experience. This enhancement will allow our customers, primarily the residential Pro, to initiate a return from their job site versus having to return big and bulky items to the store. This is a massive win, not only for pros, but also for associates and/or stores and will drive better customer satisfaction and greater store productivity. These initiatives are just a few examples of the different ways we are improving the shopping experience for customers and/or associates. I am so excited about all we are doing to drive sales in our stores, and I look forward to the opportunity that's ahead of us. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates. And I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, our sales were impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects. However, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. Before providing commentary on our comp performance, it's important to note that we made some merchandising department changes to more closely reflect our customers shopper categories and better align with our merchandising growth efforts. We now have 16 departments up from 14 previously and have separated electrical and lighting and kitchen and bath. Additionally, we have renamed our tools department to power and included outdoor power equipment to capture synergies and maximize the strength of our battery-powered platforms. Turning to our department comp performance for the first quarter. Our building materials and power departments posted positive comps, while outdoor garden, paint, lumber, plumbing, and hardware were all above the company average. During the first quarter, our comp transactions decreased 1.5%, and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the projects such as kitchen and bath remodels. Turning to total company online sales. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. We are incredibly focused on removing friction for our customers to create an excellent interconnected shopping experience. We continue to work on improving our online search functionality and serving the most relevant product offerings to our customers. To do this, we rolled out an intent-based search engine that combines keywords, behaviors, and intent to deliver more targeted results. And we enhanced our filtering capabilities, improving the customer's ability to find exactly what they are looking for. All of these initiatives work together to drive strong results in our online business. Pro and DIY customers performance was relatively in line with one another, but both were negative for the quarter. While Pro backlogs remain relatively stable, we hear from our pros that homeowners continue to take on smaller projects. The investments we are making are resonating with our pros as we see increased engagement. For example, we have made significant progress with the Pro who paints and continue to see share gains with this customer. Our partnerships with BEHR and PPG, as well as enhanced capabilities around their in-store service and job site delivery capabilities, are helping to remove friction from their experience. During the end of the first quarter, we hosted our annual Spring Black Friday and spring gift center events and saw strong performance across both events. Our merchants did a fantastic job curating the best products, and we saw strong engagement with our customers throughout the event. We are pleased with the results we saw, particularly in categories like riding lawn mowers and outdoor power equipment, where we had experienced some discretionary pull forward over the last couple of years. The trend away from gas to battery-powered products is continuing, and we are well positioned with our assortment. We have the brands our customers are looking for, whether it's RYOBI, Milwaukee, DEWALT, Makita, or RIDGID. We estimate that there are nearly 500 million batteries in the market today, and our assortment covers the vast majority of these batteries. In fact, more than 70% of batteries with brands that are exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel. With hundreds of products across each of these platforms, this is one of the best loyalty programs that keeps customers coming back to The Home Depot. And our live goods category looks incredible. We are ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables for every type of gardener. We're excited about spring breaking across the country, and we remain ready to help our customers with all of their outdoor projects and outdoor living needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $36.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 2.3% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were negative 2.8% with comps of negative 4% in February, negative 0.8% in March and negative 3.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were negative 3.2% for the quarter with comps of negative 4.8% in February, negative 1.3% in March, and negative 3.6% in April. For the quarter, Mexico posted positive comps, whereas Canada was slightly below the company average. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, an increase of approximately 45 basis points from the first quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation cost and shrink. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 140 basis points to 20.2% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a benefit from a legal settlement that we are overlapping from the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as deleverage from our top-line results. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.9%, compared to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the first quarter decreased by $13 million to $428 million. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.6%, compared to 24.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.63, a decrease of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,337. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million square feet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.4 billion, down approximately $3 billion or 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.5 times, up from 3.9 times last year. Turning to capital allocation. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $850 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As a reminder, in March, we announced our intent to acquire SRS Distribution, and as a result, we paused share repurchases. As you've heard us say many times, we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and that is not changing. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend, and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. From time to time, we will also invest in the business through acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and to accelerate our strategic objectives. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 37.1% down from 43.6% -- excuse me, down from 43.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Now, I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2024. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our guidance does not currently reflect any impact from the announced acquisition of SRS. The acquisition is currently under regulatory review, and we expect it to close by the end of fiscal 2024. We expect total sales growth to outpace sales comp with sales growth of approximately positive 1% and comp sales of approximately negative 1%. Total sales growth will benefit from a 53rd week, and we expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. We expect operating margin of approximately 14.1%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and our diluted earnings per share percent growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023. It is our intent to update guidance as appropriate once the SRS transaction closes. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Christine, we are now ready for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about how the -- how you think the bathtub effect could play out? Do you have a sense of how much maybe the weather was a net headwind year over year, understanding that last spring was also wonky? And related to that, Billy mentioned being pleased with spring where the weather was good and some positive commentary and some early COVID-winning categories. So, where there was normal weather, did you see comps maybe get flat or even -- or maybe up around the spring business? Thanks.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Hey, good morning, Chris, wonky is a great word to describe this spring. We can't really point to one geography that has had consistently good weather. But yes, certain markets, particularly in some of the Northern most markets where we've had some good weekends, business was just incredible. And that's really what powered the positive comp in our power business. A lot of that is driven by outdoor power equipment. We talk a lot about the battery platforms and the brands we have, and customers are really responding to that category. But we just haven't had the consistent weather across the country. We were looking for much improved Western division this year given how bad weather was last year in the West, but that really didn't happen. So, the bathtub is in effect, but we still have a long way to go. Our biggest selling weeks are ahead of us and certainly hope for some drier weather in sunnier days. But, Billy, maybe you can add some commentary.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. No, thanks for the question, Chris. And as Ted mentioned, I mean, if you go back and we knew that there was pull forward in a lot of discretionary categories, single item purchases, if you will. And we're really pleased to see some of those businesses more normalize to the cyclical cycle of what you would typically see. And there's no question that that was -- had been an impact certainly last year, and so really pleased with seeing some of that. Yes, where the weather has been great, which hasn't been or consistent, I should say, we've seen great customer engagement. I mentioned our spring Black Friday event, our spring gift center events. We've seen great consumer customer engagement there. And there's still the continued pressure that we see in finance big projects as they called out in kitchen and bath, specifically in the kind of remodeling finance projects. But really pleased with some of the customer engagement, some of those pull-forward categories so far.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst And just to dig in on that a little bit on the big-ticket sort of two sides of the coin, is the big-ticket finance project business did it get worse because rates spiked in on the other side, categories like garden equipment and grills and patio, are you seeing any emergence of replacement cycle where you could see maybe those categories start to get back to flat, if not up?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Chris, this is Richard. So, just from a year-over-year perspective, we saw big-ticket pressure last Q1, which was more of the item purchase as customers deferred those sort of item purchases. We saw big-ticket pressure this Q1 as well and yet the dynamic has changed, and the dynamic really that we began to see toward the back half of last year was this deferral of large projects like Billy called out. So, the pressure in those categories has actually increased. It's a different story of Q1 2023 versus 2024. And maybe, Billy, you talked about particular categories.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. Again, the kitchen and bath remodel project cabinets and so forth, I mean, anything that's financed, we continue to see even a little bit more pressure. Conversely, and you just mentioned, Chris, some of the categories more item buying. I mean, the category like riding mower is well over $1,000 purchase, and we're seeing just in a few categories like that, terrific customer engagement. Again, we had pulled forward, but we're really pleased with some of those specific item purchases even the ones that are over $1,000, as I mentioned, riding mowers and some other categories where we've seen really back to that cyclical customer engagement. We're really pleased with some of those pieces that we're seeing in the business.Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thanks very much. Have a great rest of spring.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Chris.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, everyone. My first is a macro, and I'm going to follow-up with a micro. I want to ask your opinion on lock-in effect versus turnover. If it's clear that we need turnover now for stronger demand, and if you can talk about demand in regions of the country where pricing is more noticeably going up than others seeing if there is a real lock-in effect that can happen. And the contingency is if we don't get rate decreases, what sort of normal could look like?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer So, Simeon, I think you have to think about this short term and longer term. So, if we think about lock-in effect and the impact of housing turnover. Clearly, we've seen two years of significant decrease in housing turnover to the point where we're at really sort of at historical lows. And most folks think that that can't get much lower. When you're thinking about current performance, obviously, that puts pressure on our business. When a customer buys or sells a home, they spend more in that year than in a year when they don't. And so, there's no doubt that we're missing some of that project demand, and that's what's going on our sales as we had anticipated. Then you have to ask yourself though, the lock-in effect, the interest rate environment, at this point, a lot of subject to the macro. I think the question is at what point current interest rates become sort of the new normal. This is not something that we're making a prediction on. It's just thinking about behavior. At some point, spend on housing shifts from discretionary to something that you simply must do. We know that there's pent-up demand for household formation. And so, again, I'd say short term, it is having an impact on our customers' mindset. And it's not just housing turnover-related spend. It's really all large projects. As Billy said, sort of debt finance spend where we are seeing interest rates sort of weigh on the mind of customers. And look, we're not immune to this. If you look at the national figures on what's really driving the consumer right now, its services. Goods are underperforming services, and durable goods are seeing the most pressure and, in particular, home-related categories. So, this is not a surprise and this is baked into our expectations for the year. The question will be how it evolves over time.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks. That's helpful, Richard. My follow-up, transaction is still negative, but on a stack, it looks like they're getting a little better if we're not overreading it, and that's despite the spring weather not breaking yet. So, if you look at your transactions on an improving trend line, is that industry bottoming, getting better, or is that Home Depot taking share?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, those are challenging to tease out. I would say our sense is we are taking share. That's from third-party reporting on 4441, but transactions, I think you have two dynamics going on, and they relate to your prior question, Simeon. We've talked about the COVID and the lap of the COVID it is sort of like the giant storm and the hurricane. And for a couple of years, after you pulled so much demand forward, you suffer from lower sales in those categories. And that's what we were talking about last year and when Billy was just reviewing this item buying, there was no doubt, grills and riders and patio sets, these big-ticket items were pulled forward. We're seeing now that sort of naturally lap sort of like that hurricane effect lapping. What is newer, and we chatted about this before, is the housing turnover, which while historically not a huge driver of demand, it's steady state demand as housing turnover is fairly steady. But in the last 18-odd months is that has dropped from over 6 million units a year. I think at some run rates in certain months, it was even under 4 million. That dramatic decrease in housing activity is sort of the newer hurricane, if you will. And we don't see that going much lower. It's hard to predict, but as Richard said, tough to call the macro. But at some point, people will start to lap the interest rates and the lock-in effect. We've already seen percentages of houses with mortgages and all the various interest rate strata the percentage that we're in that under 3.5% is past peak. So, you're already starting to see a bit of an unlock there. But all of that then leads to your transaction question. So, we are starting to see some increase in transaction as we're lapping more of the COVID pull forward, some newer pressure with the housing turnover dynamic. But net-net, we like the trend of transactions in units per basket were also up, and we like seeing that trend as well. So, not unexpected, as Richard said, and all baked into our guidance for 2024.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer And just to add to that, you think about how we're performing in spite of large projects, having seen the pressure, if you just look at debt financing and you look at some of the statistics around where we're sitting, HELOC withdrawals or HELOC borrowings, down 23% year over year. That's a Q4 statistic, but I think we're in the same territory in Q1. In dollars, that's dropping somewhere from 70 billion-ish a quarter to 50 billion-ish a quarter. And you look at cash out refinancing down 14% year over year, in dollars this peaked around $80 billion, and they were $17 billion last quarter. And so, you've got a significant drop, more than 75% from peak to where we are today. And so, that's to us, interesting context for the fact that transactions have actually begun to recover on a sequential basis. So, we're punching through the environment. But in some respects, as Ted said, the macro has been against us for a little while now. And you could almost say those statistics are stabilizing at least on the bottom.Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks. Good luck.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning, and thank you. I want to start with a clarification on the outlook. You've got 1% EPS growth. I just want to confirm that this incorporates the buyback pause post Q1. And then second, transaction growth stepping in the right direction. Curious if this was more Pro or DIY driven or both? And any color on the health of small and midsized pros versus larger Pros?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Great. So, Zach, I'll take the first part. It's Richard. So, look, as we have reiterated guidance and see no reason to do anything about that. And when you think about the pause in share repurchases, think about the fact that we're also accumulating cash. As we accumulate cash, we earn interest on that cash. You'll see on our balance sheet, we have over $4 billion in cash right now, which is around $3 billion higher than last year. So, given where short-term interest rates are, that interest income is a really strong offset to the impact from pause share repurchases and therefore, the net of it wouldn't change our guidance.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And on the Pro/DIY, each were negative for the quarter, more or less the same rate. And within Pro, the larger Pro continues to outperform particularly those engaging in the ecosystem. I'll let Chip comment more about our performance there.Chip Devine -- Senior Vice President, Outside Sales Yes. Thanks, Zach. Where we've expanded our capabilities around our supply chain capabilities and the expansion of our outside sales teams, we've seen noticeable outperformance in those markets and positive comps. So, very pleased with that margin of expansion. And as we move into this next nine months, we'll expand in another three FTC markets that we've mentioned, one in LA, one in Detroit, and one in San Antonio. So, we're very pleased with our progress.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. Appreciate the color. And then, Richard, quickly, it looks like your SG&A on a per-store basis was about flat year over year when you exclude the legal impact. And I'm curious if this is the right way to think about productivity this year or if you have any other levers at your disposal through the year.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Well, look, again, I would encourage you to look at our full-year guidance because operating expense management can vary quarter to quarter. Obviously, we wanted to make sure that we were fully staffed in our stores. And as we said, we had a little bit later start to spring than we would have liked. And so -- but we wanted to make sure that we were right there in front of our customer. We had other favorability. I mean, hats off to all our teams driving productivity throughout the portfolio, but in that particular point, operating expense is controlled by our operations team just did a fantastic job landing the quarter. And that's all baked into the reaffirmation of guidance.Zach Fadem -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thanks so much for the time.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Good morning, guys. The scope of the answer here might be a little beyond this conversation. But in general, can you talk about how you plan to utilize SRS and their discrete set of Pro relationships to potentially leverage your broader complex Pro initiatives?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Sure, Scott. First and foremost, SRS is just a great company operating in three large, highly fragmented markets. So, we talked about our TAM being $950 billion at the investor conference. With SRS in their market of roofing, specialty trade, pool, and landscape, that opens up $50 billion increased TAM were they are a strong number two in each of those segments. So, just a well-run company in three great growth markets where they have strong share positions. So, first and foremost, you get capability that lets you engage and win in a completely new TAM. How it's complementary to what we're doing, all the things that we are building, they have as a distributor. We've been a retailer for 45 years, and we're building wholesale capability, things like trade credit, things like much more robust on time and complete delivery to job sites, things like order management, things like incentivized field sales forces. So, these are all things that they've done for years, and we look forward to being able to engage with them and learn from them. But then they can also serve our customers. I mean, our customers will benefit from their deep, broad catalogs in those verticals, and we can cross-sell their product into our residential focused Pro customer. So, we look at this as just a great opportunity to expand market, to expand capabilities, and to better service our customers.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Very helpful. And then just, hopefully, a quickie. You talked about being in 17 markets by end of the year for the complex Pro capabilities. How many markets do you ultimately see that capability rolled out to its 17 going to X.Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I mean, we would expect to -- over time, to be in -- we often talk about the top 40, kind of 80-20 rule of demand in our space, and that would be the expectation.Scot Ciccarelli -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. In light of the start to the year, have you -- did you give any internal discussions to moderating your expectation around the way the rest of the year could unfold especially in light of what's likely to be now fewer rate cuts than was expected 90 days ago, which may mean that the overall rate of home improvement, the market may see less of an acceleration from here?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Michael, we're not Fed watchers here necessarily. And we said at the beginning of this year that we had a neutral stance on housing. We weren't going to take a bet on cuts or how many cuts. And that hasn't changed. What we are focused on and what our internal discussions do evolve around is our level of execution in the core business. And as I said, we couldn't be happier with how engaged this team is and how well we executed during the quarter. And if I can just take a minute to rattle off a few of these telltales, when you think what Hector has done in the stores, in terms of shrink, in leveraging our wage investments to getting attrition way down, which is helping with safety instances, what we're doing with technology and process in the store that Ann mentioned in her remarks about not just the better in-stock but the supply chain is delivering, but the actual on-shelf availability that all our tools are delivering, our supply chain and merchant teams, what an incredible job. In the face of negative comps, they took out $3 billion of inventory at cost, increased our turnover 60 basis points to 4.5 times, and increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels. I mean, that is just incredible performance. And then add our price position. We talked about prices having settled in the marketplace. We're not any more promotional this year, but our overall price position with that roller coaster that we experienced during the COVID years, we're as well positioned on price and value and innovative products as we've been in some time. And then productivity in general remains a flywheel, The Home Depot. And a lot of that SG&A leverage that you noticed, and we delivered was the efficiency in the model in having executed that 500 million in cost out that we signaled at the end of last year. So, Michael, that's what we focus on internally is controlling what we can control, and that's why I'm just so pleased with this team and their high level of execution in the quarter.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you for that, Ted. My follow-up is, there is a school of thought out there that the SRS acquisition could be assigned to Home Depot's efforts to address the complex Pro segment of the market has just proved to be a little bit more difficult than what was originally expected. How would you respond to that?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, I'd respond to say what we are doing to capture Pro share of wallet with wholesale distribution capabilities is challenging, which is why no one's done it before. But we are doing it, and we are succeeding in it and we like what we see, and that's why we continue to roll out to additional markets. We also know it's a journey. This isn't open up a DC, building a physical DC is about the simplest thing for us to do in our whole ecosystem that we're building. But it is putting together all the pieces of the ecosystem and introducing our customers to those capabilities. And as we've said before, as we introduce customers to the capabilities, it is a linear relationship between increased comp and increased engagement with those capabilities. So, we're still optimistic in green and progressing on our organic efforts. SRS really is a completely different discussion in that a terrific asset and management team was brought to our attention that opened up a specialty distribution TAM that they have just a terrific position in. So, at the end of the day, we keep reminding ourselves that we service a $45 trillion asset class with a $1 trillion TAM with The Home Depot at only about $150 billion in sales. We have so much share to gain with our consumers, in-store, online shopping with our existing Pros who largely shop our stores with this complex purchase occasion with larger Pros that we're building out the ecosystem. And now, SRS gives us a whole new white space to go play in three other verticals to take even more share. So, very, very different propositions.Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you very much, and good luck.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot. Curious on the DIY side. Have you seen any changes in spending between income cohorts? And as a follow-up, you spoke to the delayed start to spring. Curious, a few weeks here into the month of May. Maybe you could frame out how business is tracking relative to the first quarter or April?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer So, on the income cohorts, it's actually really more about project size than it is about income cohort right now. And as I said, the -- as we said, the majority of the demand pressure is in those larger projects. And that really sort of spreads itself across cohorts, you could even say that, that almost tends to show as pressure in higher-income cohorts. As we said before, though, this seems to be is it's not the inability to fund projects, it's a deferral mindset. You have this odd irony of every sound bite you read. Well, interest rates are going -- they're coming down soon. Our customers tell us, hey, with that in mind, with that on the horizon, we're just going to wait. And so, that's really the most important dynamic from an income perspective.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. And then, Chuck, just on the first couple of weeks of May. I mean, it really has been the same story where weather has been favorable. We've seen great customer engagement strengthen outdoor projects, really pleased with what we've seen for the weather has been favorable, which is my prepared remarks, the same kind of dynamic we saw through, especially later in the quarter as the weather got a little bit better in certain parts of the country.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst OK. Thanks very much. And then, Richard, one for you. Just you spoke to confirming the 33.9% gross margin rate for the year. Is there anything today that makes you feel better or maybe worse about the underlying assumptions that got you there 90 days ago in terms of shrink, transportation mix?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer I think, we're -- so, we're executing on all cylinders. And from a transportation perspective, from the merchants managing retail and costs through one of the most volatile periods last year in our history, fantastic results. And then just to add to it, look, with respect to shrink, shrink is a problem for retail, organized retail crime is not going away it's a problem for all of us. The external environment is only getting tougher. As a result, we've done a tremendous amount of work. It is amazing, the effort put forth by our teams in making investments that pay off with significant return on investment. And so, when we look at our shrink performance, I hate to say this, but the external environment is not helping. Our teams are succeeding in blunting the impact. It's still a problem, it's still a pressure in our P&L. We want to keep attacking it, but we know that we've got the best in the business facing it. And it's not only a return on investment in terms of financial performance, it's a return on investment from a customer and associate safety perspective. And so, we're really happy about that. I think that there's one dynamic. You asked about margin. There's a dynamic here that I think it's worth calling out when you think about the shape of the year, and so I'll just go there. It is not insignificant when you think about the price dynamic last year and how we saw retail settle in the market during the first half of 2023 and then essentially become what we would call settled during the second half of 2023, which has continued into Q1 and Q2 of this year. So, when you think about the AUR pressure within ticket, we reported ticket in spite of AUR pressure that is in essence about 2 percentage points this quarter year over year. And what I want to remind you of is that's a year-over-year comparison. So, we had kind of the height of -- well, let's put it in a different way. We had a lot of retail and cost settling during the first half of the year. So, that 2% pressure is an artifact of a year-over-year measurement. It is not an observation on where -- what prices are doing today, and they're relatively steady. As we move through the year, that pressure have from Q1 to Q2, so you'll have about 1 percentage point of pressure in Q2, it'll have again in Q3 and then, in essence, be going in Q4. So, you asked the question about margin. I think that is a point with respect to shape of the year that is important to put out there.Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much, Richard.Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to follow-up on Michael Lasser's question. Can you just help us understand what drives the second-half improvement in same-store sales, just given the fact that the first half has been a little bit softer here with this delayed start to spring?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Well, the primary factor is actually AUR, which we just outlined. So, if you think about pressure going from the beginning of the year in Q1 of 2 percentage points to sort of falling to zero by the end of the year, that's really the majority of the arithmetic with respect to the year.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst OK. And then to follow up on gross margin, maybe it's a question for Billy. Spring Black Friday did well. We did notice there was a new spring sale from an online-only competitor. Do you think the promotional environment is changing at all, I guess, especially on the DIY side of the business as you try to compete for that customer?Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yes. So, I'll speak to the promotional piece and thanks for the question. Listen, it's -- we're in a very rational market. And it's important to note that when we do events, we do events to drive excitement, to drive foot traffic in certain times of the year, no different than most folks do a Black Friday event, but we're doing that to drive excitement, bring value to the marketplace. We're not putting stuff, posting stuff on sale. The promotional business as it stands today in 2024 looks exactly like it did pre-COVID and before. It's no different. In fact, we've talked about appliances a little bit, but the environment really is normalized to what it was pre-COVID. And I think it's, again, important to note that we do that to drive excitement footsteps and absolutely try to bring value to our customers at these key times of the selling year.Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thanks for the detail.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question -- and I apologize. I know this is going to be a bit repetitive to at least a couple of the prior questions. But so, I may ask it a little bit different way. As you look at -- today, you reiterated guidance for 2024. As you think about what we see would transpire so to say in Q1. We talked a lot through the call about the macro pressures. The macro disruption is still impacting Home Depot. So, the question I have is to get to that guidance, the guidance you've reiterated today, do you need some type of change, some type of solidification in the macro environment from what you're seeing today?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer This -- no, Brian. Really, the only impact here was a delayed spring, and we manage this business in halves. And no matter when spring comes, it always comes, and it never impacts our annual results or guidance. So, that's why we reaffirm today.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. Then my second question, look, this with some of the macro data, and there's more chatter out there about a potential reemergence, if you will, of inflationary pressures. So, I guess the question for you is, I mean, within your business, particularly maybe more the commodity side of this, are you starting to see this, A? And then, B, as you think about to the extent that we are seeing some type -- potentially some type of reemergence of inflation, how do you view at this juncture, the ability of Home Depot to pass those type of costs along to consumers as it has in the past?Richard McPhail -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer If you look at the national statistics and you actually parse inflation, inflation is being driven in the goods space -- sorry, the services space, not in the goods space and particularly not in home-related categories, Billy, maybe just talk about observations.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yeah. And from a commodity standpoint, Brian, we've seen no impact. Obviously, we talked a lot in the last year about not only lumber, but copper, and we're pleased with the fact that there's no impact on commodities at this point and see a very stable environment.Brian Nagel -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Good. Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.Isabel Janci -- Vice President, Investor Relations Christine, we have time for one more question.OperatorThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I was hoping maybe to just expand on the weakness in certain discretionary projects such as kitchen and bath. Any way to help us better understand if there's line of sight to stabilization in the project size headwind this year and/or pressure rolling off? Meaning, is it cycling compares still? Or are you still seeing project size moderate, right, relative to some baseline, whether it's a year ago or sort of from peak levels?Ted Decker -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It's -- I mean, for sure, the single biggest pressure outside of the AUR that Richard went through was from discretionary larger decor-oriented projects. And as we've said, last year, it was more of an item story. This year, it's more of a discretionary generally finance story. If you take something like kitchen cabinets in countertops, I mean, those are probably the only categories where we've seen not just some falloff in projects and size of projects, but actually a little bit of trading down. So, it's focused on those categories. That's the only place we've seen it and are seeing it. That too will pass. I mean, I think that is now going through -- there's -- we've always had the idea that if turnover would drop, people would improve in place. I think we're still seeing the fallout from the turnover being down so dramatically. I mean, it was just six months ago that interest rates hit their peak in October of 2023 mortgage rates. So, those are the type of projects when you move into a new house, you update your kitchen, you update a master bathroom, etc. And then if you are going to stay in place and take on those type of projects outside of a move, you're generally going to finance. And as we've seen the rates tick up and the impact of rates ticking up, that's impacting that demand. So, right now, you would see a lap of that dynamic. We don't see housing turnover going lower. And then the question is interest rates. What does happen to interest rates in higher for longer? What does that mean, you guys know as much as we do on that score?Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think it was Chip's comments earlier about the Pro comp, right, being positive. I believe you said within those markets that are servicing the Complex Pro, so maybe just clarifying if that's what he said. And does that imply that you've seen a widening in the performance gap between those markets where you're servicing the complex Pro versus the company average, maybe relative to what you guys stated at the analyst day last year?Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Yes. Just reaffirming what I said, we have seen positive comps in those markets where we've invested in sales professionals and our FTC markets.Steven Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Great. Thank you.Billy Bastek -- Executive Vice President, Merchandising Thanks.OperatorThank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to hand the floor back over to you for closing comments.Isabel Janci -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you for joining us today.

      "International Game Technology Plc (IGT -2.22%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Game Technology first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Jim Hurley, senior vice president of investor relations. Jim, you may begin your conference.Jim Hurley -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Krista, and thank you all for joining us for IGT's First Quarter 2024 conference call, which is hosted by Vince Sadusky, our CEO; and Max Chiara, our chief financial officer. After some prepared remarks, Vince and Max will be available for your questions. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guaranteed, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our latest earnings release and in our SEC filings.

You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our investor relations website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Vince.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start with Q1 results that exceeded our outlook. Revenue up nearly $1.1 billion was better than expected, primarily on global gaming and iGaming performance. The 24% operating margin was 400 basis points higher than anticipated, mostly on better lottery results from Italy same-store sales and strong North American jackpot activity in late March, in addition to the timing of separation and divestiture costs. The company delivered record operating income of 273 million, excluding separation and divestiture costs. Based upon Q1 performance exceeding expectations, we've upgraded our full year 2024 revenue and profit goals, which Max will walk you through later. Focusing on the operating segments, global lottery revenue rose 6%, driven by Italy game innovation and strong product sales growth. Global lottery is now achieved six consecutive quarters of operating margin expansion. Global same-store sales were better than expected, largely on strong Italy instant ticket performance and significant U.S. multistage jackpot activity toward the end of the quarter, thanks to $1 billion plus jackpots for both Powerball and Mega Millions. Italy's more than 4% same-store sales growth reflects similar trends for both instance and draw games and was achieved on top of 10% growth in Q1 of 2023. This performance is a true testament to IGT's unique market knowledge and player insights that create compelling game innovation and go-to-market strategies. Same-store sales in North America and the rest of the world were slightly below prior year, mostly due to differences in the year-to-year cadence of new instant ticket game launches, especially for higher prize games. Global lottery sales continue to expand at a fast split, up over 20% of the period, led by a growing portfolio of high-performing eInstant games like Ghostbusters in the U.S. and Ultra Numerissimi in Italy. IGT's best-in-class lottery hardware and software solutions drove another quarter of strong product sales growth. We have some meaningful updates on the upcoming Italy lotto license tender. A recent government decree confirmed a nine-year term and minimum 1 billion euro upfront license fee, which will be payable in three tranches. In addition, the effective rate will remain 6%, which is consistent with the current license. In preparation for the upcoming tender, IGT and our current partners have entered into memorandums of understanding to maintain the existing joint venture structure for the new bid. As the only operator of this license for three decades, we are confident in our ability to compete for the next license term. I'd like to spend some time on the key product strategies driving global lottery's consistent growth. Broadly, they are new game launches, increased play frequency, and a multi-channel focus. In Italy, the team has done a fantastic job delivering compelling game innovation, including revitalizing core franchises across draw and instant games. They are successfully amplifying the impact of this innovation with coordinated launches across both retail and digital channels. In fact, our multidimensional omnichannel games won Lottery Product of the Year at February's International Gaming Awards. In instance, updated graphics and new price points and payout structures have maintained the success of iconic games like Numerissimi. We launched the 20 euro Ultra Numerissimi Extended Play Game in Q1, which helped drive incremental sales in the period. We are executing a similar strategy with Doppia Sfida's franchise, renewing it with updated graphics and an enriched game experience that will be supported by several new retail and eInstant games, as well as expanded price points over the next few months. Increased play frequency is helping drive growth in Italy draw games. This includes a second million day draw introduced in the second quarter of last year, a fourth weekly lotto draw launched in Q3, and new 10eLotto special draws occurring between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. each day that began in Q4 of last year. Outside of Italy, the mid-March launch of 500 Times the Money, Georgia's second $50 instant ticket game, is currently driving improved sales in that category. New Jersey's $50 million Explosion launched in the end of Q1 with a $20 price point, and that's having a similarly positive impact. Cash Pop, a proprietary IGT draw-based game, recently expanded to a 13th jurisdiction. The highly customized gameplay in multiple daily draw times creates an engaging player experience, which explains Cash Pop's popularity and success in helping to drive lottery sales growth. Georgia's multichannel Quick Win game launched in September currently has eight iterations in the market. The retail and iLottery games share a progressive jackpot, and sales are well-balanced across channels. Based on the strong results, there are another six Quick Win games playing for 2024. Broad-based demand for games and cabinets is driving sustained profit momentum for our gaming and digital segment, where year-to-year profit margins expanded for the 12th consecutive quarter. The global installed base grew to over 54,000 units in the quarter. This includes the seventh consecutive quarter of growth for U.S. and Canada premium units. In fact, the U.S. and Canada installed base of multi-level progressive games was up 6% from the year-end levels on the continued success of Prosperity Link and Mystery of the Lamp, which was named the top-performing new premium game at this year's EKG Slots Awards Show. Gaming machine unit sales have been of a strong multiyear growth trajectory, thanks to a consistent pipeline of exciting new games. Rising Rockets is one of the latest in that roster securing the No. 3 and No. 5 spots in top indexing new core video games. Our new cabinets, in particular, the PeakCurve 49 remain among the top performing North American cabinets, and this helped drive record U.S. and Canada average selling prices in Q1. iGaming revenue grew 10% in the quarter with GGR reaching an all-time high in March driven by strong IGT game performance in the U.S. That momentum was supported by the top-performing Cash Eruption, in addition to our popular video poker and table game offerings. We continue to see success with our bespoke game program and recently launched Wheel of Fortune Triple Extreme spin with BetMGM and Fort Knox Cats with FanDuel. IGT has had consistent success bringing gaming and digital games to market through focused R&D investment, including process improvements and more discipline in game and hardware development. Backed by strengthening portfolio of [Inaudible] IGT is currently enjoying the most success we've had in game development in over a decade. In the premium space, we've consistently delivered high-performing link progressives. Tiger & Dragon, which was just released in April, is one of our top scoring test bank titles and is off to a strong start. Four of our nonlot premium games are in the latest others top 25 new premium games, and we expect Tiger & Dragon to make its way to that list soon. In the lot arena, IGT has 11 of the top 25 indexing games, including the No. 1 and No. 3 spots with Megabucks, Double Diamond Deluxe, and Wheel of Fortune Double Diamond. We've got exciting new titles on the horizon with Whitney Houston and Prosperity Link [Inaudible] we've made significant inroads in the core video category, which represents the largest portion of industry sales, and it's a space for IGT that is underrepresented. I already mentioned the recent success of Rising Rockets, but it's worth noting the longevity of titles like Magic Treasurers and the growing library of new games, such as Golden Eagle and Golden Phoenix. The success of our games in North America is translating to the rest of the world. Magic Treasures and Mystery of the Lamp are among the top 10 indexing premium games in the EMEA region, while Magic Treasures and Egyptian Link are among the top 10 corrugates in Latin America. The encouraging land-based results are also evident in our iGaming business. IGT has three of the top five performing U.S. online games. We've had continued success with a multichannel focus, leveraging strong land-based franchises in the digital arena. Later this year, we'll be rolling out new digital games under the successful Cash Eruption, Cleopatra, and Fortune Coin franchises. So, 2024 is off to a strong start with record operating income, net of separation and divestiture costs. Our upgraded full year '24 revenue and profit outlook reflects broad-based momentum across key performance indicators in the balance of the year. We continue to make progress in separating global gaming from gaming and digital and preparing for the proposed transaction with Everi. Now, I'll turn the call over to Max.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We generated strong revenue and operating income margin in the first quarter, exceeding the outlook we provided in March and we delivered record operating income when you exclude $18 million in separation and divestiture costs related to the planned spin and merger transaction of gaming and digital. Revenue of $1.07 billion increased 1% year over year, reflecting continued growth in global lottery, partially offset by the timing of product sales in gaming and digital. We delivered operating income of 256 million and an operating margin of 24%, in line with the prior year, as strength in global lottery and improvements in R&D and SG&A cost were offset by the lower revenue contributions from gaming and digital, and separation and divestiture costs. Excluding separation and divestiture costs, operating income rose to an all-time quarterly record of 273 million, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 25.6%, propelled by strong Italy same-store sales and higher product sales margin in global lottery and easing our supply chain cost and R&D growth improvement in gaming and digital. Adjusted EBITDA was 443 million, in line with the prior year, but up 3% to 461 million, excluding the separation and divestiture cost. We generated EPS of $0.40 per share as a result of the strong operating performance indicated above and the tax rate normalization. Adjusted EPS was $0.46 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the prior year and would have been $0.04 higher year over year to $0.53, excluding the after-tax impact of separation and divestiture costs. I will now turn to a segment level review of first quarter results. Global Lottery delivered solid revenue and profit growth in the first quarter. Revenue rose 6% to 661 million, driven by strong product sales and continued Italy same-store sales growth. First quarter product sales revenue nearly, bolstered by the delivery of GameTouch 28, self-service terminals in Canada, and system software upgrades in Singapore and Germany. About 20% of this increase is due to a planned acceleration of sales originally expected to occur later in the year. As a reminder, the timing of our sales in this segment can be lumpy, and we expect to see some moderation on a full year basis given the high levels experienced in the prior year. Robust Italy same-store sales, coupled with contributions from a 2023 contract with win in Connecticut helped to drive service revenue up 3%. Operating income rose 8% to 258 million, and operating margin expanded 60 basis points, propelled with strong Italy same-store sales and product sales margin. High multi-stage effort activity later in the quarter held neutralized a previously expected year-over-year decline. In Q1, gaming and digital delivered the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion and achieved a profit in line with prior year despite lower revenue related to the timing of product sales. Revenue of $406 million declined 7% versus the prior year. The global installed base continues to expand on the strength of high-performing games and cabinet, particularly in the area of multi-level progresses. Terminal service revenue rose 2% year over year on growth in the global installed base. On a sequential basis, the rest of world installed base added over 230 units, while the U.S. and Canada was relatively stable as growth in premium casino units mostly offset expected removals in the New York WLA market. We shipped over 6,600 units in the quarter, and U.S. and Canada ASPs hit a record of nearly $17,000. However, as anticipated, product sales revenue declined year over year as the prior year benefited from more new and expansion opportunities and pent-up demand for replacement units in the U.S. and Canada and elevated IP and software licenses. iGaming revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S., coupled with favorable timing of jackpots. Despite lower revenue, operating income of 81 million was in line with the prior year, and profit expansion continued with operating margins increasing 80 basis points to 20%, driven by using our supply chain cost and R&D process improvement. We have decided to pull investor day target margin reference from this quarter onwards as the two segment combinations have rendered the comparison with the previous margin view less relevant. However, we are maintaining our outlook for 250 to 400 basis points of margin progression expected to occur in 2024. Following the closing of the merger transaction, the new management team will provide our thoughts around appropriate long-term aspirational targets for the new combined entity. In terms of the specific forces behind 2024 operating margin improvement, we can consider the following: an expected revenue growth backed by a favorable KPI momentum primarily in the international markets; the continued moderation of supply chain cost, which is mostly an H1 event; and a consistent approach focused on diligent cost management, with increased operating leverage as revenue flexes upward in the balance of the year. On the back of gaming demand stabilization in North America and continued expected recovery and expansion in international markets, we remain positive on our margin improvement trajectory going forward. Turning to the balance sheet now. We generated cash flow from operations of 120 million in the quarter, which included around 195 million in cash outflows primarily related to the timing of cash taxes and AR/AP dynamics. These timing impacts were expected, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year target of at least 1 billion in cash from operations with about 40% of the target generated in the first half and 60% in the second half of the year. We are in a solid financial position with net debt leverage of 2.9 times, matching the lowest level in IGT history, manageable near-term debt maturities, and $1.7 billion in liquidity. Based on the strong first quarter results, we are upgrading our full year outlook to the upper end of the previous range, increasing revenue expectations to approximately 4.4 billion with an operating margin of around 21%. We continue to expect about 130 million in pre-closing separation and divestiture costs related to the planned spin and merger transaction. Excluding those advanced specific costs, operating margin will be about 24%, a record level for two-year period. More immediately, for the second quarter, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately 1.05 billion and operating income margin of around 22%, which includes about a 250 basis-point impact from the pre-closing separation and divestiture costs. We believe that the current run rate on the separation and divestiture costs will continue in the short term and see the balance of those costs back-load toward the closing date. Before moving to Q&A, we would like to spend some time on key areas of investor interest regarding the spin-off of our IGT gaming and digital assets and subsequent merger with Everi. We believe the creation of two separate pure-play companies have the potential to create significant value for IGT shareholders through the delivery of cash proceeds to RemainCo, the issuance of MergeCo shares in exchange for units of SpinCo, and the potential rerating of the two companies, as well as the synergies expected at MergeCo. Many of you have asked about the path to closing the transaction. As you can see here in our various work streams and milestones required, we're making progress on each, and we expect closing to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. Speaking of progress, we have advanced in the financing portion of the transaction. We see the strong support through the extension of bank financing commitments to seven more high-caliber financial institutions. The deal was more than two times oversubscribed with the revolver successfully upsized by 50% to 750 million. The strong interest in the IGT-Everi combination that we have seen from the banking side during this process is a testament to the strength of the proposed transaction. Regarding the timing of the estimated 200 million in separation and divestiture cost, we expect to pay about two-thirds before closing with the remaining portion incurred upon closing. These costs are aligned with those of similarly complex transactions. And here, you have some perspectives on the scope of the various work streams behind them. It is important to recognize we are executing two transactions in one: the carve-out spinoff of one segment from a public-listed company and a merger with another public-listed company. That also explains partially the time needed to close the transaction as the new entity will need to be stocks ready on day one. We have had many questions about the taxable nature of the transaction. We chose this path since there is minimum tax leakage to IGT, and it allows both new companies for freedom to pursue strategic M&A and other capital allocation initiatives from day one. We currently expect the distribution to be treated as dividend. There are tax consequences to shareholders, and we have provided some insight on implications for U.S. holders as a reference here. Also, please refer to additional tax disclosure in IGT 20-F filed in March 2024. In general, the tax impact to shareholders can be viewed as a matter of timing as shareholders will receive a fair market value and tax basis in the new stock. The cash distribution to be paid to remain upon closing of the merger has a very favorable impact on the leverage profile of the stand-alone lot of the company. We intend to allocate about 2 billion of net distribution to paying down debt. That puts RemainCo 2023 pro forma net debt leverage at about 2.5 times, strengthening the company's financial condition. Based upon that, the pro forma adjusted EBITDA figure for RemainCo sits at around 1.2 billion. At this point, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, can you help with that, please? Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hi, guys. Good morning. Vince, what's the reaction been from customers regarding the proposed transactions? I guess, what are they most excited about? And are there areas of concerns you've had to address? Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, good question. Both the IGT commercial teams and the Everi commercial teams have spent a lot of time with customers. They both have good-sized sales forces, especially in North America. And I've spoken with customers as well. And universally, you know, we have not received negative feedback. I think the opportunity for customers is to have a competitor that has a greater collective amount of R&D resources focused in the right areas. I would say, you know, over the last couple of years, in particular IGT has been very competitive. We've got our cabinets. Our PeakCurve 49 cabinets ranked No. 2. We've had a string of hit games in the MLP space. We've revamped our mechanical reel. We come out after more than a decade a new, very effective video poker product, etc. So, we've had really good momentum. The infrastructure side of the casino centered around cash access has been a real strength of Everi's and really integral to the operation best-in-class as well. So, you know, we've not had any customers concerned around kind of market pressure or any of those types of things since we're complementary in those areas. And then, when you think about the various regions, you have some regions are VLT markets, some are [Inaudible] markets, some are class 2 markets. And, you know, each one of us has strong offerings in one of these respective areas. So, the opportunity to over time, be able to bring game themes that individually we are producing on a stand-alone basis into those markets is something that operators understand and are excited about. So, they see us as a better equipment supplier with a more fulsome offering. And, you know, I think anecdotally, we've got a good amount of cheerleaders on the casino side, just I think a real testimony to the service orientation of after units are sold, the support that takes place on the every side and on the IGT side with our amazing field services group and ability to constantly upgrade and service these machines in the field being best-in-class. So, I think, you know, overall, it's been met with a really positive response. So, we can't wait to get disclosed, and we're excited to get together and be able to be one unit.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst That's great. And then, just as a follow-up, you know, while you guys are working on your separation, a gaming competitor just closed on an acquisition of an iLottery competitor. So, I'm curious how you see that transaction impacting your iLottery positioning given your proposed separation. Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, combinations, right? It's all about execution. So, it will be interesting to see how that plays out. But that competitor has a good iLottery product, and, you know, we've competed against that product effectively with our lottery products over the last three years or four years. So, again, iLottery enjoys good growth, right still being kind of early days of customer uptake. And we've continued to enjoy really good double-digit growth in the iLottery space. And we've been successful in continuing to bring more iLottery, both platform and content customers to IGT lottery. So, as you'd imagine, any high-growth space has competition. And again, I have no idea what the plans are for that entity. But on a stand-alone basis, they've been a good competitor, and they help to keep our team sharp. And we constantly rank our games versus our competition games' performance, and we've got many of the top-performing iLottery games, as well as benchmarking platform. So, again, we welcome the competition.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Stantial with Stifel. Please go ahead.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe starting off on the announcement around the lotto JV structure. Vince, could you just expand a bit further on the strategic rationale for leaving the JV structure intact. Obviously, the balance sheet looks a lot different than the last time you went through this process. So, just curious what led you to decide to incorporate funding partners again this time around.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I would say, you know, when you look back at partnerships over the duration of the term, you have the ability, of course, with the advantage of hindsight to evaluate how successful the partnership has been. And we think the partnership between Allwyn, Arianna, Novomatic, we think it's been a successful partnership the team has worked, I think, as good partners. Of course, we operate it, we run it. You know, the joint venture has advantages in terms of funding and also the ability to bring in incremental folks with, you know, lottery experience in different areas. So, again, it operated well. And so quite simply, we decided we would -- we and our partners decided to continue it, and we are moving ahead with this. We think the stability of what we've had for many years is beneficial to all and no reason to offset that.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Right. That makes sense. Thanks for that color. And then, turning to the guidance revisions. If you back out Q1 and your Q2 guidance from the full year guidance, it looks like you are expecting about 52% of revenues to come in the back half of the year. Can you just expand a bit more on the expected seasonality or I guess acceleration? Is this mostly casino slot purchasing seasonality? Or what else is driving your expectation for more back-half weighted '24? Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, I'd say, you know, on the lottery side, we when you look forward, we expect a low single-digit same-store sales growth as we look with the limited visibility we have, given the momentum we've got in Italy and what we are seeing in North America and in the rest of the world. We've had several of our markets have launched new instant tickets, which is -- which I think it will be super helpful given the strong high-priced instant ticket launches in some significant jurisdictions in the early part of last year. So, we think that's super helpful. The multi-state jackpot has been such attractive to consumers. We saw toward the end of last year and into the beginning of this year a bit of jackpot fatigue in that area as there is been a lot more frequent billion dollar or close to billion dollar advertised jackpot. But then that accelerated. And we actually saw, you know, on a weekly basis, sales toward the large jackpots improve at the end of the run in 2024 for these last couple of Powerball and Mega Millions billion-dollar plus jackpots. So, that's, I think, a good encouraging sign. On the gaming side, we had just an incredible amount of pent-up demand going into 2023. So, you know, a bit of a difficult comp. However, when we look forward, and it's really all about how well the games are performing now and the upcoming game launches, we're really excited. Again, you know, as I mentioned I think not just myself and the team would say that we are in the best shape we've been in a decade with consistent high-ranking launches of not only MLP games, premium games, which are critical and evidenced by the continued expansion of the installed base on the premium side in North America. But now in core as well, the team has been able to put together some core games that look pretty exciting. Again, I think -- I mentioned Rising Rockets is one of our -- premiering No. 3 and No. 5, close to 2.5 times house average in early days. So, that's something that's new for us and pretty exciting. And so, we are looking ahead at unit shipments. And we know from what our casino customers have reported, you know, some mixed results. But again, they had a very challenging January with weather, as well as, you know, record-setting numbers for last year. So, I'm actually encouraged. I see the continued performance at or around last year's level as really good. And in chatting with our customers, some got off to a bit of a slow start with capital expenditures. But the conversations have gone well. And again, I think as long as we are in a position where our games are performing, you know, we are entitled to get our fair share of both the purchasing and installed base replacements that are projected to take place this year. So, as we look out, we do see, for the second quarter unit shipments -- I'm sorry, kind of this sales funnel building kind of around similar levels to prior year. And we think that throughout the course of the year, that will continue to improve for us and through a combination of both, you know, the industry and the performance of our games. And I'll hand it over to Max for any other --Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer I would say that -- the only item I'd like to add is that on the back of the strong KPI momentum we have been experiencing in the last few quarters in gaming, including ASP installed base and all of that, we think we can continue to achieve positive revenue momentum in the balance of the year.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Vince. Thanks, Max. Appreciate all the color, and congrats on a strong quarter.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. I wanted to, Vince, just talk about sort of the update on the Italy concession. I'm a bit curious how that came about. I don't recall sort of getting this early insight last time. Obviously, is there any potential for it to change as we move down the road since there is a fair amount of time? And, you know, I guess to the degree that you can, you know, plan or provide for it ultimately being resolved, that obviously is a pretty good thing, right? Any insight there would be helpful. Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, going back to the years ago, the last renewal, I think, you know, the process of the announcement of the term and the rate and the fee is the first step. And then, of course, there is multiple approvals to steps that take place, including the drafting of a formal RFP and then the bid and award process, which, you know, will take some time. And I'll let Max take you through more of the details of the process.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer So, in the beginning of April, a governmental decree has been issued in Italy which basically highlights the key features of the new bid will include now the ADM. The appropriate agency needs to draft the tender. There are a few steps in the legislative agenda to follow the drafting of the tender, including the opinion of compatibility with EU tender rules. Once the tender is issued, then interested parties make their assessments offer a bid, the bid gets assessed, all the offers get assessed by the ADM. So, all in all, we expect that the time is still to be around 12 months to 18 months to full execution of this process. But definitely, we welcome this -- the announcement of the KPIs, the key indicators, for the bid as it provides a lot of clarity. And on the back of that, as Vince said, we have extended the memorandum of understanding the existing consortium for the upcoming bid.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Understood. And if I can just follow up quickly on the margin side and make sure we're perfectly clear. I mean the margins are very, very good. I want to make sure that I'm comping, you know, what you've said today with what was last time. And if I'm reading correctly, right, it was 20 to 21, including roughly 300 basis points of impact from the pending deals. And now, right, we're excluding those and going to a top-end of 24%, right? So, there is a bit of improvement, but I just want to make sure we're all perfectly clear on what the change is and what the update is.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, correct. So, effectively, when you take the midpoint of the original margin guidance range, we're moving the margin up 50 bps with this upgrade. So, again, we think that improvement is solid and is backed by a very strong Q1, which came in better than expected. Some of that was timing related so timing of separation costs. The catch-up on the jackpot was not originally expected on a year-over-year basis. So, that also helped fill the gap. And then, there is obviously underlying strength in our performance as a combination of the different markets that came to fruition a strong -- obviously, a strong Italy market in lottery helps our margin a lot. So, again, going forward, we believe that we'll continue to stay focused on improving our margin. And again, we need to watch out the impact of the separation and divestiture expenses because I think it's appropriate for the market to appreciate what is the organic earnings power of this group of assets versus the -- obviously, the reported number, which includes those costs, those one-time costs.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Agreed. Congrats. Thanks. Appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on some of the underlying North American trends you guys both mentioned the impact that a lot of your clients, the operators saw in January, given the inclement weather. But as it relates to lottery, did you see that in that segment as well in North America, meaning, you know, lower kind of same-store demand in January and then that picked up. And then, second part of the weather-related question is around yields. So, did you see revenue per unit or the yields for the gaming ops business start to inflect positively in any month when we got past the weather? Thanks.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, absolutely, Chad. This is right. We have seen as well a very slow start of the year in January, which probably is due to the weather situation which impacted a little bit of all the activity. But we saw also a pickup momentum in February and March, which realigned the trends correctly during the quarter. Again, both in North America for gaming and lottery. The one thing that is more important to mention for lottery is the year-over-year difference in the game -- new game launch cadence. So, last year, we were on the verge of having launched new high-ticket games, so that initial momentum was very strong. Obviously, this year, the launch cadence has a different tempo, and we expect that to happen later in the year. So, we're confident that we will be able to recover that game launch impact for the balance of the year result. And as far as gaming is concerned, the yields -- the recent yield dynamic has been very strong. We continue to make good progress on our stand-alone unit. And by the way, by the fall, replacing stand-alone units coming in with VLT going out, there is a net positive impact to the margin mix in the portfolio.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst That's great. Thank you. On the digital business, any updated views in terms of potential impact from the white paper implementations in the back half of the year? Is that factored in the guidance? I know it's not a huge contributor, but has anything changed from that respect?Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer No, nothing. We can't think of anything that has impacted our projections for the rest of the year and our business plan as a result of that.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you both. I appreciate it.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.Joe Stauff -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Italian results, lottery results, really strong organic growth over 4% on a tough comp. I was wondering if you could maybe disaggregate or discuss, was this a product specific? Was it newer products? Was it across the board? And then, I had maybe two, say, more deal-specific questions, maybe Max. When do you expect the carve-out portion of the transaction to be done? Is that -- you know, would you expect everything in terms of the various org chart boxes that you have to move around to be done by the third quarter or whatever? And when would you expect the S-4 to be filed? Thank you.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer I'll take the first question around Italy. So, yeah, the continued growth in Italy, I think is a real testimony to the team's capabilities when you think about the significant increase that was experienced in gameplay and sales in Italy in the first quarter of 2023. And then, following that up with strong growth here in the first quarter of 2024. You know, I recently spent time with the team going through our strategic plan in Rome, and it is a little bit of everything. They've got really good game innovation since we have been operating the lottery since the inception, the library of games and the knowledge of the proper games to evolve and refresh. And deep franchises like 10eLotto, I think, are things that are incredibly valuable. And the research and analysis is done around price points and various payout strategies and being aware and observing best practices around the world, I think, is all led to this plus. The retail distribution network, the partnership we have with the tobacconists and our point-of-sales teams that are constantly working with our point-of-sales operators is second to none. It's very impressive. And then, we look out going forward, the team has a very, I think, impressive slate of continued game launches and game evolution with different price points. They're looking at lower-end price points, like $0.50 launches all the way up to kind of be very price point, 15 euro, 25 euro, different payout structures in different gameplay. And all that's been coupled really recently in the last really less than two years with much more effective game launches on the iLottery side as well, emulating a lot of the teams that we have developed on the retail side but in a digital format, I think appealing to an even broader group of players. So, we've seen really good growth on that front as well. So, it's really, I think, a bit of everything and just great execution.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Great. And in terms of the second part of your question, so we've been working on the carve-out preparation for some time now. Obviously, we have to take into account that there are three years here that we need to complete. Plus, obviously, we have to follow through with the [Inaudible] in '24 as well depending on when the S-4 gets filed. So, again, work is in progress, and we are making progress as expected at this point of the year. In terms of the S-4, it's currently is in preparation, as we speak. We expect probably to be in a good position toward the second half of the second quarter toward the end of the second quarter to be able to do the initial filing. And then, obviously, the typical -- during the 60 days back and forth with the staff to finalize the document, hopefully by the end of the summertime.Joe Stauff -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Thanks, Vince. Thanks, Max.OperatorOur last question today comes from David Hargreaves with Barclays. Please go ahead.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst Hi. I wanted to check, the financing commitments you've announced, are those all of the financing you are going to need for the transaction? And then, secondly, is there any update on the disposition of the Everi bonds? What is going to happen with those? Thank you.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'll take the first part of the question. So, the financial commitment of 3.7 billion before the revolver and are going to be split between notes to be issued and TLB instrument that also will be issued round about the closing time. We think -- we believe that that package is sufficient to get MergeCo going. On top of that, we have a revolver of -- for 750 million, which was upsized from the original amount, which we think is sufficient to support the growth of MergeCo and the financial needs of MergeCo on day one. The good thing is that once we went out and promote the package, we got a superior response from financial institution -- primary financial institutions. And we were very pleased to kind of revise the commitments to the upside.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst That's helpful. No, I think there's just a little concern among investors. Are you able to say at this point if there's going to be a 101 change of control made for the Everi notes?Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer That's really Everi's question.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst Everi's. OK, I see. Thank you so much.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Sure.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back over to Vince Sadusky for closing comments.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for joining us today. As you heard, '24 is off to a good start with record operating income, net of separation, and divestiture costs. Our upgraded full year revenue and profit outlook reflects good momentum across key KPIs and the balance of the year. And the work to separate global lottery from gaming and digital is underway as we prepare for the proposed transaction with Everi. As we've said before, we believe the creation of two more focused companies better positions them to service customers and create significant value for stakeholders. So, thanks for your interest in IGT, and have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

      "International Game Technology Plc (IGT -2.22%)Q1 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the International Game Technology first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Jim Hurley, senior vice president of investor relations. Jim, you may begin your conference.Jim Hurley -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, Krista, and thank you all for joining us for IGT's First Quarter 2024 conference call, which is hosted by Vince Sadusky, our CEO; and Max Chiara, our chief financial officer. After some prepared remarks, Vince and Max will be available for your questions. During today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guaranteed, and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our current expectations are detailed in our latest earnings release and in our SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our investor relations website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Vince.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start with Q1 results that exceeded our outlook. Revenue up nearly $1.1 billion was better than expected, primarily on global gaming and iGaming performance. The 24% operating margin was 400 basis points higher than anticipated, mostly on better lottery results from Italy same-store sales and strong North American jackpot activity in late March, in addition to the timing of separation and divestiture costs. The company delivered record operating income of 273 million, excluding separation and divestiture costs. Based upon Q1 performance exceeding expectations, we've upgraded our full year 2024 revenue and profit goals, which Max will walk you through later. Focusing on the operating segments, global lottery revenue rose 6%, driven by Italy game innovation and strong product sales growth. Global lottery is now achieved six consecutive quarters of operating margin expansion. Global same-store sales were better than expected, largely on strong Italy instant ticket performance and significant U.S. multistage jackpot activity toward the end of the quarter, thanks to $1 billion plus jackpots for both Powerball and Mega Millions. Italy's more than 4% same-store sales growth reflects similar trends for both instance and draw games and was achieved on top of 10% growth in Q1 of 2023. This performance is a true testament to IGT's unique market knowledge and player insights that create compelling game innovation and go-to-market strategies. Same-store sales in North America and the rest of the world were slightly below prior year, mostly due to differences in the year-to-year cadence of new instant ticket game launches, especially for higher prize games. Global lottery sales continue to expand at a fast split, up over 20% of the period, led by a growing portfolio of high-performing eInstant games like Ghostbusters in the U.S. and Ultra Numerissimi in Italy. IGT's best-in-class lottery hardware and software solutions drove another quarter of strong product sales growth. We have some meaningful updates on the upcoming Italy lotto license tender. A recent government decree confirmed a nine-year term and minimum 1 billion euro upfront license fee, which will be payable in three tranches. In addition, the effective rate will remain 6%, which is consistent with the current license. In preparation for the upcoming tender, IGT and our current partners have entered into memorandums of understanding to maintain the existing joint venture structure for the new bid. As the only operator of this license for three decades, we are confident in our ability to compete for the next license term. I'd like to spend some time on the key product strategies driving global lottery's consistent growth. Broadly, they are new game launches, increased play frequency, and a multi-channel focus. In Italy, the team has done a fantastic job delivering compelling game innovation, including revitalizing core franchises across draw and instant games. They are successfully amplifying the impact of this innovation with coordinated launches across both retail and digital channels. In fact, our multidimensional omnichannel games won Lottery Product of the Year at February's International Gaming Awards. In instance, updated graphics and new price points and payout structures have maintained the success of iconic games like Numerissimi. We launched the 20 euro Ultra Numerissimi Extended Play Game in Q1, which helped drive incremental sales in the period. We are executing a similar strategy with Doppia Sfida's franchise, renewing it with updated graphics and an enriched game experience that will be supported by several new retail and eInstant games, as well as expanded price points over the next few months. Increased play frequency is helping drive growth in Italy draw games. This includes a second million day draw introduced in the second quarter of last year, a fourth weekly lotto draw launched in Q3, and new 10eLotto special draws occurring between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. each day that began in Q4 of last year. Outside of Italy, the mid-March launch of 500 Times the Money, Georgia's second $50 instant ticket game, is currently driving improved sales in that category. New Jersey's $50 million Explosion launched in the end of Q1 with a $20 price point, and that's having a similarly positive impact. Cash Pop, a proprietary IGT draw-based game, recently expanded to a 13th jurisdiction. The highly customized gameplay in multiple daily draw times creates an engaging player experience, which explains Cash Pop's popularity and success in helping to drive lottery sales growth. Georgia's multichannel Quick Win game launched in September currently has eight iterations in the market. The retail and iLottery games share a progressive jackpot, and sales are well-balanced across channels. Based on the strong results, there are another six Quick Win games playing for 2024. Broad-based demand for games and cabinets is driving sustained profit momentum for our gaming and digital segment, where year-to-year profit margins expanded for the 12th consecutive quarter. The global installed base grew to over 54,000 units in the quarter. This includes the seventh consecutive quarter of growth for U.S. and Canada premium units. In fact, the U.S. and Canada installed base of multi-level progressive games was up 6% from the year-end levels on the continued success of Prosperity Link and Mystery of the Lamp, which was named the top-performing new premium game at this year's EKG Slots Awards Show. Gaming machine unit sales have been of a strong multiyear growth trajectory, thanks to a consistent pipeline of exciting new games. Rising Rockets is one of the latest in that roster securing the No. 3 and No. 5 spots in top indexing new core video games. Our new cabinets, in particular, the PeakCurve 49 remain among the top performing North American cabinets, and this helped drive record U.S. and Canada average selling prices in Q1. iGaming revenue grew 10% in the quarter with GGR reaching an all-time high in March driven by strong IGT game performance in the U.S. That momentum was supported by the top-performing Cash Eruption, in addition to our popular video poker and table game offerings. We continue to see success with our bespoke game program and recently launched Wheel of Fortune Triple Extreme spin with BetMGM and Fort Knox Cats with FanDuel. IGT has had consistent success bringing gaming and digital games to market through focused R&D investment, including process improvements and more discipline in game and hardware development. Backed by strengthening portfolio of [Inaudible] IGT is currently enjoying the most success we've had in game development in over a decade. In the premium space, we've consistently delivered high-performing link progressives. Tiger & Dragon, which was just released in April, is one of our top scoring test bank titles and is off to a strong start. Four of our nonlot premium games are in the latest others top 25 new premium games, and we expect Tiger & Dragon to make its way to that list soon. In the lot arena, IGT has 11 of the top 25 indexing games, including the No. 1 and No. 3 spots with Megabucks, Double Diamond Deluxe, and Wheel of Fortune Double Diamond. We've got exciting new titles on the horizon with Whitney Houston and Prosperity Link [Inaudible] we've made significant inroads in the core video category, which represents the largest portion of industry sales, and it's a space for IGT that is underrepresented. I already mentioned the recent success of Rising Rockets, but it's worth noting the longevity of titles like Magic Treasurers and the growing library of new games, such as Golden Eagle and Golden Phoenix. The success of our games in North America is translating to the rest of the world. Magic Treasures and Mystery of the Lamp are among the top 10 indexing premium games in the EMEA region, while Magic Treasures and Egyptian Link are among the top 10 corrugates in Latin America. The encouraging land-based results are also evident in our iGaming business. IGT has three of the top five performing U.S. online games. We've had continued success with a multichannel focus, leveraging strong land-based franchises in the digital arena. Later this year, we'll be rolling out new digital games under the successful Cash Eruption, Cleopatra, and Fortune Coin franchises. So, 2024 is off to a strong start with record operating income, net of separation and divestiture costs. Our upgraded full year '24 revenue and profit outlook reflects broad-based momentum across key performance indicators in the balance of the year. We continue to make progress in separating global gaming from gaming and digital and preparing for the proposed transaction with Everi. Now, I'll turn the call over to Max.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We generated strong revenue and operating income margin in the first quarter, exceeding the outlook we provided in March and we delivered record operating income when you exclude $18 million in separation and divestiture costs related to the planned spin and merger transaction of gaming and digital. Revenue of $1.07 billion increased 1% year over year, reflecting continued growth in global lottery, partially offset by the timing of product sales in gaming and digital. We delivered operating income of 256 million and an operating margin of 24%, in line with the prior year, as strength in global lottery and improvements in R&D and SG&A cost were offset by the lower revenue contributions from gaming and digital, and separation and divestiture costs. Excluding separation and divestiture costs, operating income rose to an all-time quarterly record of 273 million, and operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 25.6%, propelled by strong Italy same-store sales and higher product sales margin in global lottery and easing our supply chain cost and R&D growth improvement in gaming and digital. Adjusted EBITDA was 443 million, in line with the prior year, but up 3% to 461 million, excluding the separation and divestiture cost. We generated EPS of $0.40 per share as a result of the strong operating performance indicated above and the tax rate normalization. Adjusted EPS was $0.46 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the prior year and would have been $0.04 higher year over year to $0.53, excluding the after-tax impact of separation and divestiture costs. I will now turn to a segment level review of first quarter results. Global Lottery delivered solid revenue and profit growth in the first quarter. Revenue rose 6% to 661 million, driven by strong product sales and continued Italy same-store sales growth. First quarter product sales revenue nearly, bolstered by the delivery of GameTouch 28, self-service terminals in Canada, and system software upgrades in Singapore and Germany. About 20% of this increase is due to a planned acceleration of sales originally expected to occur later in the year. As a reminder, the timing of our sales in this segment can be lumpy, and we expect to see some moderation on a full year basis given the high levels experienced in the prior year. Robust Italy same-store sales, coupled with contributions from a 2023 contract with win in Connecticut helped to drive service revenue up 3%. Operating income rose 8% to 258 million, and operating margin expanded 60 basis points, propelled with strong Italy same-store sales and product sales margin. High multi-stage effort activity later in the quarter held neutralized a previously expected year-over-year decline. In Q1, gaming and digital delivered the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion and achieved a profit in line with prior year despite lower revenue related to the timing of product sales. Revenue of $406 million declined 7% versus the prior year. The global installed base continues to expand on the strength of high-performing games and cabinet, particularly in the area of multi-level progresses. Terminal service revenue rose 2% year over year on growth in the global installed base. On a sequential basis, the rest of world installed base added over 230 units, while the U.S. and Canada was relatively stable as growth in premium casino units mostly offset expected removals in the New York WLA market. We shipped over 6,600 units in the quarter, and U.S. and Canada ASPs hit a record of nearly $17,000. However, as anticipated, product sales revenue declined year over year as the prior year benefited from more new and expansion opportunities and pent-up demand for replacement units in the U.S. and Canada and elevated IP and software licenses. iGaming revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S., coupled with favorable timing of jackpots. Despite lower revenue, operating income of 81 million was in line with the prior year, and profit expansion continued with operating margins increasing 80 basis points to 20%, driven by using our supply chain cost and R&D process improvement. We have decided to pull investor day target margin reference from this quarter onwards as the two segment combinations have rendered the comparison with the previous margin view less relevant. However, we are maintaining our outlook for 250 to 400 basis points of margin progression expected to occur in 2024. Following the closing of the merger transaction, the new management team will provide our thoughts around appropriate long-term aspirational targets for the new combined entity. In terms of the specific forces behind 2024 operating margin improvement, we can consider the following: an expected revenue growth backed by a favorable KPI momentum primarily in the international markets; the continued moderation of supply chain cost, which is mostly an H1 event; and a consistent approach focused on diligent cost management, with increased operating leverage as revenue flexes upward in the balance of the year. On the back of gaming demand stabilization in North America and continued expected recovery and expansion in international markets, we remain positive on our margin improvement trajectory going forward. Turning to the balance sheet now. We generated cash flow from operations of 120 million in the quarter, which included around 195 million in cash outflows primarily related to the timing of cash taxes and AR/AP dynamics. These timing impacts were expected, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year target of at least 1 billion in cash from operations with about 40% of the target generated in the first half and 60% in the second half of the year. We are in a solid financial position with net debt leverage of 2.9 times, matching the lowest level in IGT history, manageable near-term debt maturities, and $1.7 billion in liquidity. Based on the strong first quarter results, we are upgrading our full year outlook to the upper end of the previous range, increasing revenue expectations to approximately 4.4 billion with an operating margin of around 21%. We continue to expect about 130 million in pre-closing separation and divestiture costs related to the planned spin and merger transaction. Excluding those advanced specific costs, operating margin will be about 24%, a record level for two-year period. More immediately, for the second quarter, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately 1.05 billion and operating income margin of around 22%, which includes about a 250 basis-point impact from the pre-closing separation and divestiture costs. We believe that the current run rate on the separation and divestiture costs will continue in the short term and see the balance of those costs back-load toward the closing date. Before moving to Q&A, we would like to spend some time on key areas of investor interest regarding the spin-off of our IGT gaming and digital assets and subsequent merger with Everi. We believe the creation of two separate pure-play companies have the potential to create significant value for IGT shareholders through the delivery of cash proceeds to RemainCo, the issuance of MergeCo shares in exchange for units of SpinCo, and the potential rerating of the two companies, as well as the synergies expected at MergeCo. Many of you have asked about the path to closing the transaction. As you can see here in our various work streams and milestones required, we're making progress on each, and we expect closing to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. Speaking of progress, we have advanced in the financing portion of the transaction. We see the strong support through the extension of bank financing commitments to seven more high-caliber financial institutions. The deal was more than two times oversubscribed with the revolver successfully upsized by 50% to 750 million. The strong interest in the IGT-Everi combination that we have seen from the banking side during this process is a testament to the strength of the proposed transaction. Regarding the timing of the estimated 200 million in separation and divestiture cost, we expect to pay about two-thirds before closing with the remaining portion incurred upon closing. These costs are aligned with those of similarly complex transactions. And here, you have some perspectives on the scope of the various work streams behind them. It is important to recognize we are executing two transactions in one: the carve-out spinoff of one segment from a public-listed company and a merger with another public-listed company. That also explains partially the time needed to close the transaction as the new entity will need to be stocks ready on day one. We have had many questions about the taxable nature of the transaction. We chose this path since there is minimum tax leakage to IGT, and it allows both new companies for freedom to pursue strategic M&A and other capital allocation initiatives from day one. We currently expect the distribution to be treated as dividend. There are tax consequences to shareholders, and we have provided some insight on implications for U.S. holders as a reference here. Also, please refer to additional tax disclosure in IGT 20-F filed in March 2024. In general, the tax impact to shareholders can be viewed as a matter of timing as shareholders will receive a fair market value and tax basis in the new stock. The cash distribution to be paid to remain upon closing of the merger has a very favorable impact on the leverage profile of the stand-alone lot of the company. We intend to allocate about 2 billion of net distribution to paying down debt. That puts RemainCo 2023 pro forma net debt leverage at about 2.5 times, strengthening the company's financial condition. Based upon that, the pro forma adjusted EBITDA figure for RemainCo sits at around 1.2 billion. At this point, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, can you help with that, please? Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hi, guys. Good morning. Vince, what's the reaction been from customers regarding the proposed transactions? I guess, what are they most excited about? And are there areas of concerns you've had to address? Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, good question. Both the IGT commercial teams and the Everi commercial teams have spent a lot of time with customers. They both have good-sized sales forces, especially in North America. And I've spoken with customers as well. And universally, you know, we have not received negative feedback. I think the opportunity for customers is to have a competitor that has a greater collective amount of R&D resources focused in the right areas. I would say, you know, over the last couple of years, in particular IGT has been very competitive. We've got our cabinets. Our PeakCurve 49 cabinets ranked No. 2. We've had a string of hit games in the MLP space. We've revamped our mechanical reel. We come out after more than a decade a new, very effective video poker product, etc. So, we've had really good momentum. The infrastructure side of the casino centered around cash access has been a real strength of Everi's and really integral to the operation best-in-class as well. So, you know, we've not had any customers concerned around kind of market pressure or any of those types of things since we're complementary in those areas. And then, when you think about the various regions, you have some regions are VLT markets, some are [Inaudible] markets, some are class 2 markets. And, you know, each one of us has strong offerings in one of these respective areas. So, the opportunity to over time, be able to bring game themes that individually we are producing on a stand-alone basis into those markets is something that operators understand and are excited about. So, they see us as a better equipment supplier with a more fulsome offering. And, you know, I think anecdotally, we've got a good amount of cheerleaders on the casino side, just I think a real testimony to the service orientation of after units are sold, the support that takes place on the every side and on the IGT side with our amazing field services group and ability to constantly upgrade and service these machines in the field being best-in-class. So, I think, you know, overall, it's been met with a really positive response. So, we can't wait to get disclosed, and we're excited to get together and be able to be one unit.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst That's great. And then, just as a follow-up, you know, while you guys are working on your separation, a gaming competitor just closed on an acquisition of an iLottery competitor. So, I'm curious how you see that transaction impacting your iLottery positioning given your proposed separation. Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, combinations, right? It's all about execution. So, it will be interesting to see how that plays out. But that competitor has a good iLottery product, and, you know, we've competed against that product effectively with our lottery products over the last three years or four years. So, again, iLottery enjoys good growth, right still being kind of early days of customer uptake. And we've continued to enjoy really good double-digit growth in the iLottery space. And we've been successful in continuing to bring more iLottery, both platform and content customers to IGT lottery. So, as you'd imagine, any high-growth space has competition. And again, I have no idea what the plans are for that entity. But on a stand-alone basis, they've been a good competitor, and they help to keep our team sharp. And we constantly rank our games versus our competition games' performance, and we've got many of the top-performing iLottery games, as well as benchmarking platform. So, again, we welcome the competition.Barry Jonas -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you so much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Stantial with Stifel. Please go ahead.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe starting off on the announcement around the lotto JV structure. Vince, could you just expand a bit further on the strategic rationale for leaving the JV structure intact. Obviously, the balance sheet looks a lot different than the last time you went through this process. So, just curious what led you to decide to incorporate funding partners again this time around.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I would say, you know, when you look back at partnerships over the duration of the term, you have the ability, of course, with the advantage of hindsight to evaluate how successful the partnership has been. And we think the partnership between Allwyn, Arianna, Novomatic, we think it's been a successful partnership the team has worked, I think, as good partners. Of course, we operate it, we run it. You know, the joint venture has advantages in terms of funding and also the ability to bring in incremental folks with, you know, lottery experience in different areas. So, again, it operated well. And so quite simply, we decided we would -- we and our partners decided to continue it, and we are moving ahead with this. We think the stability of what we've had for many years is beneficial to all and no reason to offset that.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Right. That makes sense. Thanks for that color. And then, turning to the guidance revisions. If you back out Q1 and your Q2 guidance from the full year guidance, it looks like you are expecting about 52% of revenues to come in the back half of the year. Can you just expand a bit more on the expected seasonality or I guess acceleration? Is this mostly casino slot purchasing seasonality? Or what else is driving your expectation for more back-half weighted '24? Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, I'd say, you know, on the lottery side, we when you look forward, we expect a low single-digit same-store sales growth as we look with the limited visibility we have, given the momentum we've got in Italy and what we are seeing in North America and in the rest of the world. We've had several of our markets have launched new instant tickets, which is -- which I think it will be super helpful given the strong high-priced instant ticket launches in some significant jurisdictions in the early part of last year. So, we think that's super helpful. The multi-state jackpot has been such attractive to consumers. We saw toward the end of last year and into the beginning of this year a bit of jackpot fatigue in that area as there is been a lot more frequent billion dollar or close to billion dollar advertised jackpot. But then that accelerated. And we actually saw, you know, on a weekly basis, sales toward the large jackpots improve at the end of the run in 2024 for these last couple of Powerball and Mega Millions billion-dollar plus jackpots. So, that's, I think, a good encouraging sign. On the gaming side, we had just an incredible amount of pent-up demand going into 2023. So, you know, a bit of a difficult comp. However, when we look forward, and it's really all about how well the games are performing now and the upcoming game launches, we're really excited. Again, you know, as I mentioned I think not just myself and the team would say that we are in the best shape we've been in a decade with consistent high-ranking launches of not only MLP games, premium games, which are critical and evidenced by the continued expansion of the installed base on the premium side in North America. But now in core as well, the team has been able to put together some core games that look pretty exciting. Again, I think -- I mentioned Rising Rockets is one of our -- premiering No. 3 and No. 5, close to 2.5 times house average in early days. So, that's something that's new for us and pretty exciting. And so, we are looking ahead at unit shipments. And we know from what our casino customers have reported, you know, some mixed results. But again, they had a very challenging January with weather, as well as, you know, record-setting numbers for last year. So, I'm actually encouraged. I see the continued performance at or around last year's level as really good. And in chatting with our customers, some got off to a bit of a slow start with capital expenditures. But the conversations have gone well. And again, I think as long as we are in a position where our games are performing, you know, we are entitled to get our fair share of both the purchasing and installed base replacements that are projected to take place this year. So, as we look out, we do see, for the second quarter unit shipments -- I'm sorry, kind of this sales funnel building kind of around similar levels to prior year. And we think that throughout the course of the year, that will continue to improve for us and through a combination of both, you know, the industry and the performance of our games. And I'll hand it over to Max for any other --Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer I would say that -- the only item I'd like to add is that on the back of the strong KPI momentum we have been experiencing in the last few quarters in gaming, including ASP installed base and all of that, we think we can continue to achieve positive revenue momentum in the balance of the year.Jeff Stantial -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Vince. Thanks, Max. Appreciate all the color, and congrats on a strong quarter.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. I wanted to, Vince, just talk about sort of the update on the Italy concession. I'm a bit curious how that came about. I don't recall sort of getting this early insight last time. Obviously, is there any potential for it to change as we move down the road since there is a fair amount of time? And, you know, I guess to the degree that you can, you know, plan or provide for it ultimately being resolved, that obviously is a pretty good thing, right? Any insight there would be helpful. Thanks.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, going back to the years ago, the last renewal, I think, you know, the process of the announcement of the term and the rate and the fee is the first step. And then, of course, there is multiple approvals to steps that take place, including the drafting of a formal RFP and then the bid and award process, which, you know, will take some time. And I'll let Max take you through more of the details of the process.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer So, in the beginning of April, a governmental decree has been issued in Italy which basically highlights the key features of the new bid will include now the ADM. The appropriate agency needs to draft the tender. There are a few steps in the legislative agenda to follow the drafting of the tender, including the opinion of compatibility with EU tender rules. Once the tender is issued, then interested parties make their assessments offer a bid, the bid gets assessed, all the offers get assessed by the ADM. So, all in all, we expect that the time is still to be around 12 months to 18 months to full execution of this process. But definitely, we welcome this -- the announcement of the KPIs, the key indicators, for the bid as it provides a lot of clarity. And on the back of that, as Vince said, we have extended the memorandum of understanding the existing consortium for the upcoming bid.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Understood. And if I can just follow up quickly on the margin side and make sure we're perfectly clear. I mean the margins are very, very good. I want to make sure that I'm comping, you know, what you've said today with what was last time. And if I'm reading correctly, right, it was 20 to 21, including roughly 300 basis points of impact from the pending deals. And now, right, we're excluding those and going to a top-end of 24%, right? So, there is a bit of improvement, but I just want to make sure we're all perfectly clear on what the change is and what the update is.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, correct. So, effectively, when you take the midpoint of the original margin guidance range, we're moving the margin up 50 bps with this upgrade. So, again, we think that improvement is solid and is backed by a very strong Q1, which came in better than expected. Some of that was timing related so timing of separation costs. The catch-up on the jackpot was not originally expected on a year-over-year basis. So, that also helped fill the gap. And then, there is obviously underlying strength in our performance as a combination of the different markets that came to fruition a strong -- obviously, a strong Italy market in lottery helps our margin a lot. So, again, going forward, we believe that we'll continue to stay focused on improving our margin. And again, we need to watch out the impact of the separation and divestiture expenses because I think it's appropriate for the market to appreciate what is the organic earnings power of this group of assets versus the -- obviously, the reported number, which includes those costs, those one-time costs.David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst Agreed. Congrats. Thanks. Appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on some of the underlying North American trends you guys both mentioned the impact that a lot of your clients, the operators saw in January, given the inclement weather. But as it relates to lottery, did you see that in that segment as well in North America, meaning, you know, lower kind of same-store demand in January and then that picked up. And then, second part of the weather-related question is around yields. So, did you see revenue per unit or the yields for the gaming ops business start to inflect positively in any month when we got past the weather? Thanks.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, absolutely, Chad. This is right. We have seen as well a very slow start of the year in January, which probably is due to the weather situation which impacted a little bit of all the activity. But we saw also a pickup momentum in February and March, which realigned the trends correctly during the quarter. Again, both in North America for gaming and lottery. The one thing that is more important to mention for lottery is the year-over-year difference in the game -- new game launch cadence. So, last year, we were on the verge of having launched new high-ticket games, so that initial momentum was very strong. Obviously, this year, the launch cadence has a different tempo, and we expect that to happen later in the year. So, we're confident that we will be able to recover that game launch impact for the balance of the year result. And as far as gaming is concerned, the yields -- the recent yield dynamic has been very strong. We continue to make good progress on our stand-alone unit. And by the way, by the fall, replacing stand-alone units coming in with VLT going out, there is a net positive impact to the margin mix in the portfolio.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst That's great. Thank you. On the digital business, any updated views in terms of potential impact from the white paper implementations in the back half of the year? Is that factored in the guidance? I know it's not a huge contributor, but has anything changed from that respect?Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer No, nothing. We can't think of anything that has impacted our projections for the rest of the year and our business plan as a result of that.Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Research -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you both. I appreciate it.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.Joe Stauff -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Italian results, lottery results, really strong organic growth over 4% on a tough comp. I was wondering if you could maybe disaggregate or discuss, was this a product specific? Was it newer products? Was it across the board? And then, I had maybe two, say, more deal-specific questions, maybe Max. When do you expect the carve-out portion of the transaction to be done? Is that -- you know, would you expect everything in terms of the various org chart boxes that you have to move around to be done by the third quarter or whatever? And when would you expect the S-4 to be filed? Thank you.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer I'll take the first question around Italy. So, yeah, the continued growth in Italy, I think is a real testimony to the team's capabilities when you think about the significant increase that was experienced in gameplay and sales in Italy in the first quarter of 2023. And then, following that up with strong growth here in the first quarter of 2024. You know, I recently spent time with the team going through our strategic plan in Rome, and it is a little bit of everything. They've got really good game innovation since we have been operating the lottery since the inception, the library of games and the knowledge of the proper games to evolve and refresh. And deep franchises like 10eLotto, I think, are things that are incredibly valuable. And the research and analysis is done around price points and various payout strategies and being aware and observing best practices around the world, I think, is all led to this plus. The retail distribution network, the partnership we have with the tobacconists and our point-of-sales teams that are constantly working with our point-of-sales operators is second to none. It's very impressive. And then, we look out going forward, the team has a very, I think, impressive slate of continued game launches and game evolution with different price points. They're looking at lower-end price points, like $0.50 launches all the way up to kind of be very price point, 15 euro, 25 euro, different payout structures in different gameplay. And all that's been coupled really recently in the last really less than two years with much more effective game launches on the iLottery side as well, emulating a lot of the teams that we have developed on the retail side but in a digital format, I think appealing to an even broader group of players. So, we've seen really good growth on that front as well. So, it's really, I think, a bit of everything and just great execution.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Great. And in terms of the second part of your question, so we've been working on the carve-out preparation for some time now. Obviously, we have to take into account that there are three years here that we need to complete. Plus, obviously, we have to follow through with the [Inaudible] in '24 as well depending on when the S-4 gets filed. So, again, work is in progress, and we are making progress as expected at this point of the year. In terms of the S-4, it's currently is in preparation, as we speak. We expect probably to be in a good position toward the second half of the second quarter toward the end of the second quarter to be able to do the initial filing. And then, obviously, the typical -- during the 60 days back and forth with the staff to finalize the document, hopefully by the end of the summertime.Joe Stauff -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst Thanks, Vince. Thanks, Max.OperatorOur last question today comes from David Hargreaves with Barclays. Please go ahead.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst Hi. I wanted to check, the financing commitments you've announced, are those all of the financing you are going to need for the transaction? And then, secondly, is there any update on the disposition of the Everi bonds? What is going to happen with those? Thank you.Max Chiara -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'll take the first part of the question. So, the financial commitment of 3.7 billion before the revolver and are going to be split between notes to be issued and TLB instrument that also will be issued round about the closing time. We think -- we believe that that package is sufficient to get MergeCo going. On top of that, we have a revolver of -- for 750 million, which was upsized from the original amount, which we think is sufficient to support the growth of MergeCo and the financial needs of MergeCo on day one. The good thing is that once we went out and promote the package, we got a superior response from financial institution -- primary financial institutions. And we were very pleased to kind of revise the commitments to the upside.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst That's helpful. No, I think there's just a little concern among investors. Are you able to say at this point if there's going to be a 101 change of control made for the Everi notes?Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer That's really Everi's question.David Hargreaves -- Barclays -- Analyst Everi's. OK, I see. Thank you so much.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Sure.OperatorThat concludes our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back over to Vince Sadusky for closing comments.Vince Sadusky -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for joining us today. As you heard, '24 is off to a good start with record operating income, net of separation, and divestiture costs. Our upgraded full year revenue and profit outlook reflects good momentum across key KPIs and the balance of the year. And the work to separate global lottery from gaming and digital is underway as we prepare for the proposed transaction with Everi. As we've said before, we believe the creation of two more focused companies better positions them to service customers and create significant value for stakeholders. So, thanks for your interest in IGT, and have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

      "Organigram (OGI -0.49%)Q2 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning. My name is JL, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Organigram Holdings second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Max Schwartz, you may begin your conference.Max Schwartz -- Director, Investor Relations Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a recording will be available on Organigram's website 24 hours after today's call.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to market data are sourced from Hifyre, in combination with data from Weedcrawler, provincial boards, retailers, and our internal sales figures. Today, we will be hearing from key members of our senior leadership team, beginning with Beena Goldenberg, chief executive officer, who will provide opening remarks and commentary, followed by Greg Guyatt, chief financial officer, who will review our quarterly financial results for Q2 fiscal 2024. Also joining us for the question-and-answer segment is Tim Emberg, chief commercial officer. Before I hand the call over to Beena, I would like to extend a thank you to those on the call today who made it out to our Investor Day and facility tour in April. We received a lot of positive feedback, but by far the most common thing we heard from attendees was how compelling it was to see the initiatives we've been talking about in our communications in person. In the months to come, we will be developing a digital version of this experience for our current shareholders, and industry stakeholders can gain a better understanding of where our business is headed. With that, I will now introduce Beena Goldenberg, chief executive officer of Organigram Holdings Inc. Please go ahead, Ms. Goldenberg. Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Max, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you all joining our call today and for your continued support of Organigram. It's hard to believe that we're already halfway through our fiscal year, and we're pleased to report that the events and changes that Organigram has undergone in the first half of the year have truly set us up for success in Canada and internationally for the balance of the year and in years to come. As we venture into the second half of 2024, we are confident that we will be in a position to truly accelerate our performance in Canada and internationally while putting the building blocks in place to allow us to deliver on our ambition to be a global leader in the cannabis industry. During today's call, we'll be discussing our performance highlights for the quarter and some important themes that will illustrate why, despite some ongoing headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our growth plans. These are innovations as a continued focus area of ours and a growing competitive advantage for our company, international development as part of our ambitions to be a global leader in the cannabis space, and Canadian recreational business and how we're poised to continue on our growth trajectory. Before we dive into these exciting topics, I'd be remiss to not address one important factor enabling us to comfortably weather the headwinds and support our growth plans, and that's the increase in our cash position. This year, we significantly enhanced our already strong cash position by raising capital at a substantial premium to our share price. In Q2, shareholders approved a $124.6 million follow-on investment from BAT, with the first $41.5 million tranche successfully closed and the second $41.5 million tranche expected to close by the end of August. Additionally, toward the end of the quarter, we announced and subsequently closed an oversubscribed financing ground, generating an additional $28.8 million in gross proceeds. By the close of the final tranche from BAT at the end of February 2025, Organigram will have nearly $200 million in pro forma cash on hand, an enviable position in today's challenging environment. Once again, I'd like to emphasize our disappointment with the Canadian government's reluctance to address critical issues impacting the cannabis industry in Canada. The biggest challenge most Canadian cannabis LPs -- for most Canadian cannabis LPs lies in the struggle to achieve sustainable profitability, with excise duties representing up to 35% of sales. Despite the federal government's collection of almost $900 million in excise revenue from cannabis in 2023, surpassing revenues from beer and wine combined, no relief measures close to those extended to the beverage alcohol sector have been offered to the cannabis industry. To make matters worse, the recently announced federal budget did not address any form of improvement to the excise framework despite recommendations from the industry, the Standing Committee on Finance, the Competition Bureau, and the expert panel reviewing the Cannabis Act. Given Organigram's leadership position in the Canadian market, we remain steadfast in advocating for a fair and equitable excise framework that serves both industry interests and the federal government's objective of safeguarding public health by diverting consumers from the illicit market. Despite this ongoing challenge, Organigram is well-equipped to weather today's taxing regulatory environment and remain a leader in the sector. Not only have we demonstrated our ability to thrive in Canada, demonstrated by our 21% year-over-year growth in our recreational business this quarter, but we are also in an excellent position to invest in the growth of our international business with our robust balance sheet. Organigram's ambition to be a global leader in the cannabis space will be achieved by exporting our high-quality, high-margin products to international markets and through the expansion of our footprint in emerging markets like the U.S. and Germany, enabled by the $83 million Jupiter strategic investment pool, funded by two-thirds of BAT's follow-on investment. In Q2, the company made its inaugural Jupiter investment and second U.S.-based investment in Open Book Extracts, a leading provider of hemp-derived extracts and products. Through this investment, Organigram stands to gain invaluable insights into the U.S. landscape by leveraging OBX's extensive experience with key players in the U.S. cannabis market. Moving forward, we expect to collaborate with OBX on product launches in the U.S., capitalizing on the explosive growth of the hemp-derived THC market for edibles and beverages. With the DEA reportedly moving toward rescheduling cannabis, the opportunity in the U.S. is compelling, and we are carefully monitoring the regulatory landscape while we expand our footprint. Outside of the U.S., there are also a number of very compelling investment opportunities unfolding that we're well positioned to take advantage of: the decriminalization of cannabis in Germany, growth in Australia and the U.K., pilot programs in Switzerland, and medical frameworks being introduced in a growing number of markets, to name a few. We've also made considerable progress with our international export business and are yielding tangible results from our efforts. In January, we completed our first shipment of medical flower to Sanity Group in Germany. And shortly after, we successfully shipped cannabis to 4C Labs for distribution in the U.K. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed our second shipment to Sanity. Further, we signed two new supply agreements with medical cannabis suppliers in Australia and the U.K., all while exploring additional opportunities in entirely new markets for Organigram. Our international revenue saw significant decline versus Q2 fiscal 2023, driven by a large reduction in sales to Israel as we await payment of an outstanding receivable. We are working with our Israeli customer on a payment plan and are optimistic that we will resume shipments to Israel in due course. That said, we are very encouraged by our return to international sales growth over the last three quarters, supported by our new international customers. Furthermore, our growth in flower exports is poised to receive a significant boost from Organigram's EU-GMP licensing at our Moncton facility. Following the successful preliminary audit in February, we are optimistic that obtaining the certification thereby enhancing our export margins and further expanding our international customer base. Now, if Organigram is synonymous with one thing, I think we could all agree that it's our relentless pursuit of consumer-centric innovation as a competitive advantage. Where other companies are cutting back, we're doubling down. You've heard me speak about the nanoemulsion technology that's being worked on by the product development collaboration team. Excitingly, the PDC have received the preliminary results from the groundbreaking clinical study that was undertaken to validate this technology. The team is now analyzing the data, and we're excited to share the results with you soon. The patent-pending nanoemulsion technology aims to unlock the full power of ingested cannabinoids that will enable consumers to navigate and control their dosage experience more accurately, a key consumer pain point in the ingestible space. The nanoemulsion production equipment was recently transported to Organigram's Winnipeg facility in April, and the company is preparing to scale up production and sales for these gummies in the fall. Another differentiated innovation play we remain bullish on stems from our first U.S. investment in Phylos Bioscience in May of 2023. As a result of this investment, we are the only company in Canada offering whole flower-derived THCV. Our introduction into THCV products has garnered significant attention, with retail sales surpassing $3.7 million since their launch in August of '23 and the completion of our first international shipment of THCV flowers subsequent to quarter-end. Consumer feedback for the super sativa powerhouse has been very positive to date, and we plan to continue to expand our portfolio of THCV products. The Phylos investment also brought a seed-based production that many of you have seen showcased during our Investor Day in April. Phylos' seed-based technology presents a transformative growth opportunity for Organigram. We are now systematically transitioning a portion of our Moncton facility to seed-based production, which promises to increase plant yields, significantly reduce cultivation costs, shorten harvest cycles, and deliver more consistent and robust plants. The anticipated cost savings of seed-based production per gram versus clone-based methods range between 30% to 40%. As of now, we have four seed-based production rooms online, which is a slower ramp-up than we originally had planned due to the time involved in obtaining seed characteristics which satisfied changing consumer preferences. However, we are encouraged by the yield and potency results of our first harvest. As we streamline our selection processes and further build out our pipeline of seed candidates, we anticipate that we will meet our goal of 30% seed-based production by the end of calendar 2024. Regarding vape, we previously highlighted our investment in Greentank as a means to bring innovation to our vape portfolio and finally address our underperformance in this category. In Q2, we conducted a test launch of Greentank's new atomizing technology in select markets. At the end of the test launch, we saw higher-than-expected consumer returns. And given our firm commitment to quality, the consumer, and our provincial board partners, we are working to address the issue before our anticipated national rollout. In parallel, extensive work within the PDC has taken place on several innovative vape solutions that we believe will begin to add to Organigram's portfolio of compelling and differentiated vape products. On the research innovation front, Organigram's recent achievements include significant reductions in THC to CBN conversion time by 75%. We are now able to produce 100% of our CBN demand in-house and are on our way to doing the same with CBG. We have also developed an isolation method to produce zero THC THCV isolate with an 85% purity level. We are identifying more genetic markers for disease and powdery mildew resistance, terpene synthesis, and other markers, which will allow us to select cultivars with more of the properties we want and less of the ones we don't. As we continue to identify new genetic markers, it's only a matter of time until we can selectively breed F1 seeds that result in the consistent expression of the desired genetics. Research like this is what sets Organigram apart from other producers and provides us with a long-term advantage. Now, on the domestic front. Organigram maintains a leadership position in every major product category except vapes. As of Q2, Organigram held the No. 1 position in milled flower, No. 1 in hash, No. 1 in ingestible extracts, No. 1 in pure CBD gummies, No. 2 in overall edibles, No. 2 in infused pre-rolls, No. 3 in all pre-rolls, and No. 3 in dried flower, bringing us to the overall No. 3 market position in Canada. Our continued success in almost every category is owed to our relentless dedication to quality, innovation, and focus. As the top pure-play cannabis company in Canada, everything we do at Organigram is geared toward creating the most exciting cannabis brands and products on the market developed in Canada to delight consumers around the world. Regionally, we achieved remarkable growth in Atlantic Canada, with retail sales surging by over 36% to achieve a 16.1% share. Additionally, our market share in Quebec reached a record-high 9.1% in March, signaling that we're building a stronghold in Canada's second most populous province, all while maintaining a top 5 position in every other province across Canada. It goes without saying that we're committed to innovation. But innovations are stronger when they're carried by great brands. The success of our SHRED brand underscores our commitment to innovation and market leadership. With retail sales now exceeding $200 million annually, SHRED has introduced several industry-first innovations, including flavor-forward milled flower, Rip-Strip Hash, whole flower-derived THCV gummies, and milled THCV flower. In Q2, we introduced our first carton-style box of joints, SHRED Rainbow Oz. Dartz, offering consumers seven packs of 10 Dartz in four different flavors. Our newly launched SHRED X Rainbow Heavies, which consists of three flavored IPRs with over 40% THC, achieved over $450,000 in retail sales within their first month in the market. Among our other successful brands are Monjour, which continues to dominate the pure CBD gummies segment with 51% market share, growing 65% year over year; Tremblant, which leads in hash, resulting in our 23% share in the category; and Big Bag O' Buds, which is a leader in our large format flower category. We don't often speak about Big Bag O' Buds, but this quarter, we launched Serial Jealousy, a new cultivar from Organigram. This was our fastest-ever launch to reach $1 million in sales and our highest sales achieved for a new launch within two months of hitting the market. We are also particularly excited about the revitalization of our Trailblazer brand, aimed at meeting the needs of a very large and underserved consumer segment, the passionate female believer. The new Trailblazer flower line was unveiled, showcasing hang-dried, smart-cured, hand-packed, premium and potent flower pre-rolls in vibrant glass jars, with shipments that began in April. So, to recap, the latter half of fiscal 2024 presents many opportunities for Organigram. Our growth in the domestic market continues due to our focus on innovation and understanding consumers. Our $83 million Jupiter fund and excellent balance sheet allow us to explore more strategic investments like Phylos and Open Book Extracts, geared toward garnering competitive advantages and growing our international footprint. And we are growing our export customer base, which contributes to expanding our international revenue. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Beena. As Beena mentioned in her comments, our recreational net revenue grew by 21% versus Q2 last year, versus approximately 7% market growth over the same period. When taken together with the decrease in international sales compared to Q2 of last year, we saw a net increase in our gross revenue of 8.6% to 57.4 million for the quarter, compared to 52.9 million in the same period -- the same prior-year period. Given the impact of a decrease in international sales of 8.6 million between Q2 and the same prior-year period, our net revenue saw a modest contraction in the quarter of 5%, resulting in 37.6 million in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in wholesale revenue of 1.3 million. Organigram is current with its excise duty obligations, remitting approximately 34% of its gross revenue to the CRA. Organigram's cost of sales in Q2 fiscal 2024 was 26.4 million, compared to 29.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of 12%. The decrease in the cost of sales over the same prior-year period was primarily due to higher inventory provisions in Q2 fiscal 2023 of 3.2 million related to net realizable value adjustments of inventory. We harvested approximately 19,900 kilograms of flower during Q2 fiscal 2024, compared to 20,600 kilograms in Q2 fiscal 2023, which represents a decrease of approximately 3%. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in our cultivar mix to address change in consumer preferences. While yields and THC content will fluctuate over time, the trend we have seen in the -- over the last two years has been larger yields and higher potency. In Q2, year over year, Organigram experienced a 79% increase in flower produced containing more than 24% THC. Now, about 25% of our harvest is clocking in between 24% and 26% THC, and 25% that's testing above 26%. Compared to Q2 fiscal 2023, our yield per plant has increased. Higher yields should reduce the cost of cultivation in the long run and as the flower is sold, and we expect to achieve higher gross margin rate. In Q3, we should begin to see some lower-cost flower harvested in Q2 flow through the P&L, with that trend expected to continue into Q4. In Q2 fiscal 2024, adjusted gross margin remained stable at 31% or 11.7 million sequentially. Compared to the same prior-year period, we experienced a decline in our adjusted gross margin rate from 34%. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower international sales, which declined from 10.8 million to 2.2 million between Q2 fiscal 2023 and Q2 fiscal 2024. The delta here is related to reduction in shipments to Israel, which have yet to recover. Sequentially, however, our international sales have increased to 2.1 million, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the latter half of fiscal 2024. In Q2, Organigram realized approximately 2.4 million of the 10 million in annual savings that we outlined at the end of fiscal 2023. And the year to date, we have realized 4.7 million of these savings. Driving these continued savings is the use of in-house remediation and rapid drying technology. There are several other efficiency-driving initiatives underway that we expect will lower operating costs further. We are reducing the bench time for our clones from 21 days to 14 days, which will reduce costs annually and increase capacity by approximately 1,300 kilograms by freeing up two additional grower rooms. Also, we are focused on power reduction initiatives, which we project will result in 2.3 million in annual savings. We're optimizing warehouse distribution between Moncton and Winnipeg to save on freight for customers in Western Canada. Included in our Q2 SG&A was a reserve of 4.2 million related to our outstanding receivables from our Israeli customer, Canndoc. SG&A remained relatively flat, adjusting for the Canndoc receivable provision at 15.9 million, compared to 16.1 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, or a decrease of 1%. While G&A costs decreased by 1.2 million, they were offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs of 1.1 million related to higher competition in the Canadian marketplace. This quarter, we posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of 1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of 5.6 million in the same prior-year period. This loss was attributed to lower net flower revenue and lower international sales, which negatively impacted our adjusted gross margin rate compared to the prior-year period. We're confirming our outlook that our positive adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 will exceed that of fiscal 2023. Supporting this outlook is the expected increase in international sales in the back half of fiscal 2024, as well as efficiency improvements and lower cost of flower, which is expected to start flowing through our P&L in the back half of fiscal 2024. Net loss for Q2 fiscal 2024 was 27.1 million, compared to a net loss of 7.5 million in the same prior-year period. The increase in net loss from the comparative period is primarily due to a lower gross margin, resulting from a reduction in the gain of fair -- on fair value of biological assets and an increase in the fair value loss of derivative liability of approximately 11.9 million related to the future issuance of BAT-preferred shares. From a statement of cash flow perspective, net cash used in operating activities was 9 million in Q2 fiscal 2024, compared to a use of 19.7 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in cash used in operating activities of 54% was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, resulting from a shift from monthly to quarterly payments of excise duties in accordance with excise duty regulation payment schedules and improvements in our regular payment terms. Cash used by investing activities in Q2 fiscal 2024 was 1.9 million, compared to cash provided of 11.7 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, which was driven by a redemption of short-term investments in Q2 2023 of 15.2 million. On the topic of cash, we're very pleased to state that we have one of the healthiest balance sheets in the industry. As of March 31, 2024, we had a total cash position of 83.6 million, including both restricted and unrestricted cash. Negligible debt. And as Beena mentioned, our pro forma cash position after the closure of the second and third BAT tranches and our recent equity rates of gross proceeds of 28.8 million is expected to start approaching $200 million. We focused our efforts this quarter on bolstering our cash, driving costs out of the business, expanding our international reach, and expanding market share while investing in the long-term efficiency of our business to set us up for success in the latter half of fiscal 2024 and beyond. We did incur the loss of margin due to lower international sales and our focus on rapidly growing 2.0 segments such as infused pre-rolls, which attracted higher excise duties. However, we head into Q3 confident that the back half of the year will demonstrate our ability to generate improved financial results. We continue to expect positive cash flow from operations before working capital adjustments by the end of fiscal 2024. This concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Beena.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Greg. The cannabis industry is still in its infancy. And after considerable growing pains, it looks like we're entering a period of renewed excitement around the sector, fueled by macro tailwinds that we believe will favor established leaders in the space, of which Organigram is clearly one of the very few in Canada. Today, Organigram stands as a leading LP with significant cash reserves and negligible debt. This represents a considerable competitive advantage, substantially mitigating liquidity risks, and facilitating the expansion of our presence in international cannabis markets. We have persisted through every challenge presented to us, ranging from irrational price compression, overstated THC levels, nanny state regulations, and an illogical excise framework to achieve growth in our domestic business and to set us up for a long-term growth trajectory. We also recognize the benefits of being challenged to bring excellence to every aspect of our business and have used this environment to hone our competitive edge. While this quarter, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA, we're confident that our domestic and international market growth, our innovation pipeline, and investments and long-term efficiencies will result in improved financial performance throughout the back half of fiscal 2024. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. So, once again, thank you for your continued interest and support of Organigram. I will now open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Grey of Alliance Global Partners. Your line is open.Aaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and thank you for the questions. First one for me, Greg, I believe you mentioned still expecting adjusted EBITDA to exceed prior year's. I think that's in reference to the 5.5, right? So, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And then if you could just provide, you know, some more granularity in terms of those puts and takes. You talked about, you know, some of the gross margin improvement you're expecting in terms of shifting to the seed-based production. You talked about some opex improvements as well. You mentioned greater international, I believe, when you made reference to that as well. So, just in terms of the puts and takes of getting to EBITDA exceeding 2023 for the back half of fiscal 2024, what we should expect in terms of the top-line gross margin and EBITDA to help us get there? Thank you.Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Thanks, Aaron. Let me try to unpack all of that. So, for -- first your question on EBITDA. Yes, you heard that correctly. We'll exceed the EBITDA from fiscal 2023 in the back half of this year. As far as margins and the various puts and takes, first, I'll start with -- in the second quarter. And, you know, we had -- versus the prior year, we had less international. And as you know, international is much higher margin than domestic and does not include any excise duty obligations. Also, during the quarter, our mix skewed toward IPRs, which is good news, and that we're driving leadership in that category. But at the same time, it's a new category for us. So, you know, we're still working out some of the kinks in the production area and really working on improving our production efficiencies there, which we've made good progress on, and we expect to see some movement on that in the back half of this year. Also, in the second quarter, we had lower JOLTS sales, Q2 versus Q1, which also would have been a bit of a drag on margin during the period. So, as we go forward into the back half of the year, you mentioned the seed-based production, that should start flowing through toward Q4. And as Beena mentioned, that's about a 30% to 40% cost reduction. And that's not going to be 30% to 40% in totality, obviously. But, you know, as the -- as we've said before, our plan is, by the end of calendar this year, to have about 30% of the garden seed-based, which we'll see the benefit from. Also, moving forward, we're really working on making operational efficiency improvements in some production areas where we've seen higher than -- higher waste than we would have liked in Q1 and Q2, and that's particularly around tube-style pre-rolls, which, again, is a relatively new process for us. And just in the last number of weeks, we started to see real improvement in that area. We expect to drive that going forward as well. Also, just, you know, the cost savings initiative that we mentioned before, about the 10 million target for the year, we made great progress on that. 5.5 million more to go in the back half around freight, logistics, energy, and also some post-harvest efficiencies that we expect to see coming through. I hope that answers your question there, Aaron.Aaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- Analyst No, it did. No, really appreciate that color there, Greg. Second question for me, right, so you guys have the OBX investment. Within the U.S., there's been a number of public operators, you know, talking more about the hemp-derived beverage market specifically, but also, you know, edibles, including some listed on the Nasdaq, similar to you. So, can you speak, you know, toward your views specifically on the hemp-derived beverage and potentially edibles market, too? You know, given your line of sight with the OBX investment, are you seeing some opportunities there? Is there some ability for you to leverage BAT's distribution? You know, it's not a liquor channel there, but there are still some convenience and maybe some bodegas and otherwise that could be leveraged. So, just your view of the hemp-derived beverage market, you know, how big the opportunity is and if you think there's opportunities for OGI to come within it. Thanks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Thank you, Aaron. So, first of all, we're very excited about the hemp-derived THC market for ingestibles, for both beverages and for edibles. And certainly, our relationship with OBX gives us a first line of sight into the market and the opportunity. We do see there's a patchwork of states in the U.S. that are -- have regulated the Delta-9 THC hemp-derived, and there are some that are perhaps not regulated but are not enforcing. And so, this market continues to grow, and we continue to track how big the opportunity is. What excites us about this is the direct-to-consumer opportunities, that you could move products across state lines. So, there's a lot of very interesting opportunities around the space. We are reviewing what the opportunities are internally. We see the opportunity of using the nanoemulsion technology that we're developing in some of the products that we take to the market in the U.S. at some point in the future and the opportunity to leverage the clinical study that we did to make claims in that market. So, we do think we have a competitive differentiation that we could take so we could enter the market. We are looking at whether it's beverages or edibles, and we're looking at ways to get the product to market. So, nothing in the short term in terms of using the BAT distribution network. We'd be looking at how OBX is getting products out. We'd be looking at other partners that we could leverage. So, let's -- you know, it's still a work in progress, something that we're evaluating as we look out. And obviously, needless to say, everything we do, we're going to make sure that we're compliant with our Nasdaq listing, with our TSX listing. So, this is an area that we're navigating carefully as we look to get some products into the U.S. market.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.Matt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's well. Yeah, I just had a follow-up question on the reserve you took for that receivable. So, relative to your international contribution, you know, it is sizable, obviously not really material to the company or quarter overall. But I'm just curious if we can get a little more detail on that. Is this biomass that wasn't accepted over in Israel? Is it -- is there a dispute there? Has that product been returned? I'm just trying to get an idea of where that relationship is. And then if Israel is still a market, that will be a focus in the near term.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer No problem, Matt. Let me take that on and say to you that there is no issue with the product that was shipped over. This was a situation where the receivable was due at the end of October, and we all know what happened in that country on October 7th. So, there is a delay in payment. The customer says they'll pay us, but at this point, it's six months past due. And so, we took the reserve on our books. We expect to continue to work with the customer to get a payment plan that we're comfortable with. And, you know, it is our intention to, in due course, get back to shipping to Israel. It's an important market for cannabis, and it's a higher margin market than Canada, as Greg alluded to, in terms of our international growth. And so, it's something that we want to do. But obviously, with the size of the outstanding receivable, we have been on standby at this point and we have stopped shipping until we get this resolved.Matt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst OK. Thanks for that. And just one other question for me, just on the cadence of sort of the adjusted EBITDA rebound for the back half of the year here. I'm just wondering if the sort of cash flow from operations will be linear to that, or will we see an outperformance in sort of the CFO, given the fact that international sales likely have a higher margin and will drive more to the bottom line?Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Hey. Thanks for that question, Matt. Right now, we're expecting the cash flow from operations improvement to be roughly linear, and that's really driven by the changes in working capital. And, you know, we are continuing to invest in the business, and we're investing in working capital as well. So, you know, that's really going to be an important driver there beyond just the sales internationally. And for example, over the first quarter, we invested more in inventory than we had in the past in order to make sure that our customer service levels were much higher than they had been. So, this is an example. Our on-time and in-full shipment to the provinces was up to over 95% in Q2 as a result of that investment. So, that's the one caveat to the linear versus sort of exponential following the international.OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Frederico Gomes of ATB Capital Markets. Your line is open.Frederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on Germany. I think, yesterday, there was an article mentioning there was a change in regulations there that could, you know, potentially expedite the second pillar of their legalization plan. So, I'm just curious if you've seen that. Could you comment on it in terms of your expectations for that second pillar, as well as just, you know, in terms of your EU-GMP certification, do you have any sort of timeline for that? Thank you.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer No problem, Fred. So, let me start with the first point. Yes, we have seen the same news around the second pillar of the German legalization progress, and we're excited about that. Really, what that was all about is enabling pilot programs similar to what we've seen in Switzerland, where they're going to allow, you know, to certain, I guess, licensed producers or cannabis companies to have pilot facilities so they could pilot programs so that they could test how the market runs and form some better understanding of the market. We're excited about that. We're talking with some of our customers that we're dealing with in Germany about the opportunities in that market. And this is just, again, another example of the legalization framework opening up in Germany, which we're excited about. It's another big market. So, any progress like this, no different than the DEA rescheduling that they're talking about in the U.S., these are all good macro tailwinds for the industry, and we're excited about the opportunity it presents. In terms of the EU-GMP, we had our preliminary audit back in February, and we were successful with that audit. So, we're now just waiting for confirmation from the regulatory authorities and when they will be coming out to do the final audit. You know, our hope is that it will happen this summer. But, you know, we're kind of not in control of their timeline, so we're just waiting for that to be scheduled.Frederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you for that, Beena. My second question is just you mentioned that, you know, rescheduling in the U.S. could potentially help your U.S.-based strategy in terms of your investments. So, just curious, how exactly could that play out? Is it about the sort of investments that you would be able to pursue and -- while, you know, keeping -- being compliant with your Nasdaq listing, or is it about helping, I guess, your investments that you have already made in the U.S. to perform better? So, just any color on how rescheduling could help you in the U.S. Thanks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. So, again, just to reiterate, look, we think that the whole DEA rescheduling is really a positive move forward that signals, you know, the evolution of the U.S. movement toward federal legalization. So, we're excited about that. Now, it doesn't really help much for us from a compliance position, as you mentioned. With our Nasdaq and TSX listings, we still can't consolidate or control anything that's plant-touching. However, we do think that the --you know, the whole rescheduling is expected to take some time, but it will happen. And we think that this will benefit the two -- our two U.S. investee companies. And, you know, we're invested in them. So, that's a benefit to us. It's still a small amount of benefit at this time. But we think that with the Jupiter fund, we have the opportunity to take advantage of other opportunities in the U.S. market. And so, this is just a positive all around for us as we look to expand our global footprint.OperatorThank you. And with no further questions, that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Beena for closing remarks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Well, again, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. I know that we have some exciting plans ahead, and we do look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. So, with that, I'll end the call.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Max Schwartz -- Director, Investor RelationsBeena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive OfficerGreg Guyatt -- Chief Financial OfficerAaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- AnalystMatt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- AnalystFrederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst\n",

      "Organigram (OGI -0.49%)Q2 2024 Earnings CallMay 14, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood morning. My name is JL, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Organigram Holdings second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Max Schwartz, you may begin your conference.Max Schwartz -- Director, Investor Relations Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a recording will be available on Organigram's website 24 hours after today's call. Listeners should be aware that today's call will include estimates and other forward-looking information, from which the company's actual results could differ. Please review the cautionary language in our press release dated May 14, 2024, on various factors, assumptions, and risks that could cause our actual results to differ. Further, reference will be made to certain non-IFRS measures during this call, including adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted gross margin, among others. These measures do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and are intended to provide additional information, and as such, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our approach to calculating these measures may differ from other issuers, so these measures may not be directly comparable.Please see today's earnings report for more information about these measures. In this call, references to fiscal 2023 are to the 13-month period from September 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. Listeners should also be aware that the company relies on reputable third-party providers when making certain statements relating to market share data. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to market data are sourced from Hifyre, in combination with data from Weedcrawler, provincial boards, retailers, and our internal sales figures. Today, we will be hearing from key members of our senior leadership team, beginning with Beena Goldenberg, chief executive officer, who will provide opening remarks and commentary, followed by Greg Guyatt, chief financial officer, who will review our quarterly financial results for Q2 fiscal 2024. Also joining us for the question-and-answer segment is Tim Emberg, chief commercial officer. Before I hand the call over to Beena, I would like to extend a thank you to those on the call today who made it out to our Investor Day and facility tour in April. We received a lot of positive feedback, but by far the most common thing we heard from attendees was how compelling it was to see the initiatives we've been talking about in our communications in person. In the months to come, we will be developing a digital version of this experience for our current shareholders, and industry stakeholders can gain a better understanding of where our business is headed. With that, I will now introduce Beena Goldenberg, chief executive officer of Organigram Holdings Inc. Please go ahead, Ms. Goldenberg. Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Max, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you all joining our call today and for your continued support of Organigram. It's hard to believe that we're already halfway through our fiscal year, and we're pleased to report that the events and changes that Organigram has undergone in the first half of the year have truly set us up for success in Canada and internationally for the balance of the year and in years to come. As we venture into the second half of 2024, we are confident that we will be in a position to truly accelerate our performance in Canada and internationally while putting the building blocks in place to allow us to deliver on our ambition to be a global leader in the cannabis industry. During today's call, we'll be discussing our performance highlights for the quarter and some important themes that will illustrate why, despite some ongoing headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our growth plans. These are innovations as a continued focus area of ours and a growing competitive advantage for our company, international development as part of our ambitions to be a global leader in the cannabis space, and Canadian recreational business and how we're poised to continue on our growth trajectory. Before we dive into these exciting topics, I'd be remiss to not address one important factor enabling us to comfortably weather the headwinds and support our growth plans, and that's the increase in our cash position. This year, we significantly enhanced our already strong cash position by raising capital at a substantial premium to our share price. In Q2, shareholders approved a $124.6 million follow-on investment from BAT, with the first $41.5 million tranche successfully closed and the second $41.5 million tranche expected to close by the end of August. Additionally, toward the end of the quarter, we announced and subsequently closed an oversubscribed financing ground, generating an additional $28.8 million in gross proceeds. By the close of the final tranche from BAT at the end of February 2025, Organigram will have nearly $200 million in pro forma cash on hand, an enviable position in today's challenging environment. Once again, I'd like to emphasize our disappointment with the Canadian government's reluctance to address critical issues impacting the cannabis industry in Canada. The biggest challenge most Canadian cannabis LPs -- for most Canadian cannabis LPs lies in the struggle to achieve sustainable profitability, with excise duties representing up to 35% of sales. Despite the federal government's collection of almost $900 million in excise revenue from cannabis in 2023, surpassing revenues from beer and wine combined, no relief measures close to those extended to the beverage alcohol sector have been offered to the cannabis industry. To make matters worse, the recently announced federal budget did not address any form of improvement to the excise framework despite recommendations from the industry, the Standing Committee on Finance, the Competition Bureau, and the expert panel reviewing the Cannabis Act. Given Organigram's leadership position in the Canadian market, we remain steadfast in advocating for a fair and equitable excise framework that serves both industry interests and the federal government's objective of safeguarding public health by diverting consumers from the illicit market. Despite this ongoing challenge, Organigram is well-equipped to weather today's taxing regulatory environment and remain a leader in the sector. Not only have we demonstrated our ability to thrive in Canada, demonstrated by our 21% year-over-year growth in our recreational business this quarter, but we are also in an excellent position to invest in the growth of our international business with our robust balance sheet. Organigram's ambition to be a global leader in the cannabis space will be achieved by exporting our high-quality, high-margin products to international markets and through the expansion of our footprint in emerging markets like the U.S. and Germany, enabled by the $83 million Jupiter strategic investment pool, funded by two-thirds of BAT's follow-on investment. In Q2, the company made its inaugural Jupiter investment and second U.S.-based investment in Open Book Extracts, a leading provider of hemp-derived extracts and products. Through this investment, Organigram stands to gain invaluable insights into the U.S. landscape by leveraging OBX's extensive experience with key players in the U.S. cannabis market. Moving forward, we expect to collaborate with OBX on product launches in the U.S., capitalizing on the explosive growth of the hemp-derived THC market for edibles and beverages. With the DEA reportedly moving toward rescheduling cannabis, the opportunity in the U.S. is compelling, and we are carefully monitoring the regulatory landscape while we expand our footprint. Outside of the U.S., there are also a number of very compelling investment opportunities unfolding that we're well positioned to take advantage of: the decriminalization of cannabis in Germany, growth in Australia and the U.K., pilot programs in Switzerland, and medical frameworks being introduced in a growing number of markets, to name a few. We've also made considerable progress with our international export business and are yielding tangible results from our efforts. In January, we completed our first shipment of medical flower to Sanity Group in Germany. And shortly after, we successfully shipped cannabis to 4C Labs for distribution in the U.K. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed our second shipment to Sanity. Further, we signed two new supply agreements with medical cannabis suppliers in Australia and the U.K., all while exploring additional opportunities in entirely new markets for Organigram. Our international revenue saw significant decline versus Q2 fiscal 2023, driven by a large reduction in sales to Israel as we await payment of an outstanding receivable. We are working with our Israeli customer on a payment plan and are optimistic that we will resume shipments to Israel in due course. That said, we are very encouraged by our return to international sales growth over the last three quarters, supported by our new international customers. Furthermore, our growth in flower exports is poised to receive a significant boost from Organigram's EU-GMP licensing at our Moncton facility. Following the successful preliminary audit in February, we are optimistic that obtaining the certification thereby enhancing our export margins and further expanding our international customer base. Now, if Organigram is synonymous with one thing, I think we could all agree that it's our relentless pursuit of consumer-centric innovation as a competitive advantage. Where other companies are cutting back, we're doubling down. You've heard me speak about the nanoemulsion technology that's being worked on by the product development collaboration team. Excitingly, the PDC have received the preliminary results from the groundbreaking clinical study that was undertaken to validate this technology. The team is now analyzing the data, and we're excited to share the results with you soon. The patent-pending nanoemulsion technology aims to unlock the full power of ingested cannabinoids that will enable consumers to navigate and control their dosage experience more accurately, a key consumer pain point in the ingestible space. The nanoemulsion production equipment was recently transported to Organigram's Winnipeg facility in April, and the company is preparing to scale up production and sales for these gummies in the fall. Another differentiated innovation play we remain bullish on stems from our first U.S. investment in Phylos Bioscience in May of 2023. As a result of this investment, we are the only company in Canada offering whole flower-derived THCV. Our introduction into THCV products has garnered significant attention, with retail sales surpassing $3.7 million since their launch in August of '23 and the completion of our first international shipment of THCV flowers subsequent to quarter-end. Consumer feedback for the super sativa powerhouse has been very positive to date, and we plan to continue to expand our portfolio of THCV products. The Phylos investment also brought a seed-based production that many of you have seen showcased during our Investor Day in April. Phylos' seed-based technology presents a transformative growth opportunity for Organigram. We are now systematically transitioning a portion of our Moncton facility to seed-based production, which promises to increase plant yields, significantly reduce cultivation costs, shorten harvest cycles, and deliver more consistent and robust plants. The anticipated cost savings of seed-based production per gram versus clone-based methods range between 30% to 40%. As of now, we have four seed-based production rooms online, which is a slower ramp-up than we originally had planned due to the time involved in obtaining seed characteristics which satisfied changing consumer preferences. However, we are encouraged by the yield and potency results of our first harvest. As we streamline our selection processes and further build out our pipeline of seed candidates, we anticipate that we will meet our goal of 30% seed-based production by the end of calendar 2024. Regarding vape, we previously highlighted our investment in Greentank as a means to bring innovation to our vape portfolio and finally address our underperformance in this category. In Q2, we conducted a test launch of Greentank's new atomizing technology in select markets. At the end of the test launch, we saw higher-than-expected consumer returns. And given our firm commitment to quality, the consumer, and our provincial board partners, we are working to address the issue before our anticipated national rollout. In parallel, extensive work within the PDC has taken place on several innovative vape solutions that we believe will begin to add to Organigram's portfolio of compelling and differentiated vape products. On the research innovation front, Organigram's recent achievements include significant reductions in THC to CBN conversion time by 75%. We are now able to produce 100% of our CBN demand in-house and are on our way to doing the same with CBG. We have also developed an isolation method to produce zero THC THCV isolate with an 85% purity level. We are identifying more genetic markers for disease and powdery mildew resistance, terpene synthesis, and other markers, which will allow us to select cultivars with more of the properties we want and less of the ones we don't. As we continue to identify new genetic markers, it's only a matter of time until we can selectively breed F1 seeds that result in the consistent expression of the desired genetics. Research like this is what sets Organigram apart from other producers and provides us with a long-term advantage. Now, on the domestic front. Organigram maintains a leadership position in every major product category except vapes. As of Q2, Organigram held the No. 1 position in milled flower, No. 1 in hash, No. 1 in ingestible extracts, No. 1 in pure CBD gummies, No. 2 in overall edibles, No. 2 in infused pre-rolls, No. 3 in all pre-rolls, and No. 3 in dried flower, bringing us to the overall No. 3 market position in Canada. Our continued success in almost every category is owed to our relentless dedication to quality, innovation, and focus. As the top pure-play cannabis company in Canada, everything we do at Organigram is geared toward creating the most exciting cannabis brands and products on the market developed in Canada to delight consumers around the world. Regionally, we achieved remarkable growth in Atlantic Canada, with retail sales surging by over 36% to achieve a 16.1% share. Additionally, our market share in Quebec reached a record-high 9.1% in March, signaling that we're building a stronghold in Canada's second most populous province, all while maintaining a top 5 position in every other province across Canada. It goes without saying that we're committed to innovation. But innovations are stronger when they're carried by great brands. The success of our SHRED brand underscores our commitment to innovation and market leadership. With retail sales now exceeding $200 million annually, SHRED has introduced several industry-first innovations, including flavor-forward milled flower, Rip-Strip Hash, whole flower-derived THCV gummies, and milled THCV flower. In Q2, we introduced our first carton-style box of joints, SHRED Rainbow Oz. Dartz, offering consumers seven packs of 10 Dartz in four different flavors. Our newly launched SHRED X Rainbow Heavies, which consists of three flavored IPRs with over 40% THC, achieved over $450,000 in retail sales within their first month in the market. Among our other successful brands are Monjour, which continues to dominate the pure CBD gummies segment with 51% market share, growing 65% year over year; Tremblant, which leads in hash, resulting in our 23% share in the category; and Big Bag O' Buds, which is a leader in our large format flower category. We don't often speak about Big Bag O' Buds, but this quarter, we launched Serial Jealousy, a new cultivar from Organigram. This was our fastest-ever launch to reach $1 million in sales and our highest sales achieved for a new launch within two months of hitting the market. We are also particularly excited about the revitalization of our Trailblazer brand, aimed at meeting the needs of a very large and underserved consumer segment, the passionate female believer. The new Trailblazer flower line was unveiled, showcasing hang-dried, smart-cured, hand-packed, premium and potent flower pre-rolls in vibrant glass jars, with shipments that began in April. So, to recap, the latter half of fiscal 2024 presents many opportunities for Organigram. Our growth in the domestic market continues due to our focus on innovation and understanding consumers. Our $83 million Jupiter fund and excellent balance sheet allow us to explore more strategic investments like Phylos and Open Book Extracts, geared toward garnering competitive advantages and growing our international footprint. And we are growing our export customer base, which contributes to expanding our international revenue. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Beena. As Beena mentioned in her comments, our recreational net revenue grew by 21% versus Q2 last year, versus approximately 7% market growth over the same period. When taken together with the decrease in international sales compared to Q2 of last year, we saw a net increase in our gross revenue of 8.6% to 57.4 million for the quarter, compared to 52.9 million in the same period -- the same prior-year period. Given the impact of a decrease in international sales of 8.6 million between Q2 and the same prior-year period, our net revenue saw a modest contraction in the quarter of 5%, resulting in 37.6 million in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in wholesale revenue of 1.3 million. Organigram is current with its excise duty obligations, remitting approximately 34% of its gross revenue to the CRA. Organigram's cost of sales in Q2 fiscal 2024 was 26.4 million, compared to 29.6 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of 12%. The decrease in the cost of sales over the same prior-year period was primarily due to higher inventory provisions in Q2 fiscal 2023 of 3.2 million related to net realizable value adjustments of inventory. We harvested approximately 19,900 kilograms of flower during Q2 fiscal 2024, compared to 20,600 kilograms in Q2 fiscal 2023, which represents a decrease of approximately 3%. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in our cultivar mix to address change in consumer preferences. While yields and THC content will fluctuate over time, the trend we have seen in the -- over the last two years has been larger yields and higher potency. In Q2, year over year, Organigram experienced a 79% increase in flower produced containing more than 24% THC. Now, about 25% of our harvest is clocking in between 24% and 26% THC, and 25% that's testing above 26%. Compared to Q2 fiscal 2023, our yield per plant has increased. Higher yields should reduce the cost of cultivation in the long run and as the flower is sold, and we expect to achieve higher gross margin rate. In Q3, we should begin to see some lower-cost flower harvested in Q2 flow through the P&L, with that trend expected to continue into Q4. In Q2 fiscal 2024, adjusted gross margin remained stable at 31% or 11.7 million sequentially. Compared to the same prior-year period, we experienced a decline in our adjusted gross margin rate from 34%. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower international sales, which declined from 10.8 million to 2.2 million between Q2 fiscal 2023 and Q2 fiscal 2024. The delta here is related to reduction in shipments to Israel, which have yet to recover. Sequentially, however, our international sales have increased to 2.1 million, and we expect this trend to continue throughout the latter half of fiscal 2024. In Q2, Organigram realized approximately 2.4 million of the 10 million in annual savings that we outlined at the end of fiscal 2023. And the year to date, we have realized 4.7 million of these savings. Driving these continued savings is the use of in-house remediation and rapid drying technology. There are several other efficiency-driving initiatives underway that we expect will lower operating costs further. We are reducing the bench time for our clones from 21 days to 14 days, which will reduce costs annually and increase capacity by approximately 1,300 kilograms by freeing up two additional grower rooms. Also, we are focused on power reduction initiatives, which we project will result in 2.3 million in annual savings. We're optimizing warehouse distribution between Moncton and Winnipeg to save on freight for customers in Western Canada. Included in our Q2 SG&A was a reserve of 4.2 million related to our outstanding receivables from our Israeli customer, Canndoc. SG&A remained relatively flat, adjusting for the Canndoc receivable provision at 15.9 million, compared to 16.1 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, or a decrease of 1%. While G&A costs decreased by 1.2 million, they were offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs of 1.1 million related to higher competition in the Canadian marketplace. This quarter, we posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of 1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of 5.6 million in the same prior-year period. This loss was attributed to lower net flower revenue and lower international sales, which negatively impacted our adjusted gross margin rate compared to the prior-year period. We're confirming our outlook that our positive adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2024 will exceed that of fiscal 2023. Supporting this outlook is the expected increase in international sales in the back half of fiscal 2024, as well as efficiency improvements and lower cost of flower, which is expected to start flowing through our P&L in the back half of fiscal 2024. Net loss for Q2 fiscal 2024 was 27.1 million, compared to a net loss of 7.5 million in the same prior-year period. The increase in net loss from the comparative period is primarily due to a lower gross margin, resulting from a reduction in the gain of fair -- on fair value of biological assets and an increase in the fair value loss of derivative liability of approximately 11.9 million related to the future issuance of BAT-preferred shares. From a statement of cash flow perspective, net cash used in operating activities was 9 million in Q2 fiscal 2024, compared to a use of 19.7 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in cash used in operating activities of 54% was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, resulting from a shift from monthly to quarterly payments of excise duties in accordance with excise duty regulation payment schedules and improvements in our regular payment terms. Cash used by investing activities in Q2 fiscal 2024 was 1.9 million, compared to cash provided of 11.7 million in Q2 fiscal 2023, which was driven by a redemption of short-term investments in Q2 2023 of 15.2 million. On the topic of cash, we're very pleased to state that we have one of the healthiest balance sheets in the industry. As of March 31, 2024, we had a total cash position of 83.6 million, including both restricted and unrestricted cash. Negligible debt. And as Beena mentioned, our pro forma cash position after the closure of the second and third BAT tranches and our recent equity rates of gross proceeds of 28.8 million is expected to start approaching $200 million. We focused our efforts this quarter on bolstering our cash, driving costs out of the business, expanding our international reach, and expanding market share while investing in the long-term efficiency of our business to set us up for success in the latter half of fiscal 2024 and beyond. We did incur the loss of margin due to lower international sales and our focus on rapidly growing 2.0 segments such as infused pre-rolls, which attracted higher excise duties. However, we head into Q3 confident that the back half of the year will demonstrate our ability to generate improved financial results. We continue to expect positive cash flow from operations before working capital adjustments by the end of fiscal 2024. This concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Beena.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Greg. The cannabis industry is still in its infancy. And after considerable growing pains, it looks like we're entering a period of renewed excitement around the sector, fueled by macro tailwinds that we believe will favor established leaders in the space, of which Organigram is clearly one of the very few in Canada. Today, Organigram stands as a leading LP with significant cash reserves and negligible debt. This represents a considerable competitive advantage, substantially mitigating liquidity risks, and facilitating the expansion of our presence in international cannabis markets. We have persisted through every challenge presented to us, ranging from irrational price compression, overstated THC levels, nanny state regulations, and an illogical excise framework to achieve growth in our domestic business and to set us up for a long-term growth trajectory. We also recognize the benefits of being challenged to bring excellence to every aspect of our business and have used this environment to hone our competitive edge. While this quarter, we reported negative adjusted EBITDA, we're confident that our domestic and international market growth, our innovation pipeline, and investments and long-term efficiencies will result in improved financial performance throughout the back half of fiscal 2024. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. So, once again, thank you for your continued interest and support of Organigram. I will now open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Grey of Alliance Global Partners. Your line is open.Aaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and thank you for the questions. First one for me, Greg, I believe you mentioned still expecting adjusted EBITDA to exceed prior year's. I think that's in reference to the 5.5, right? So, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And then if you could just provide, you know, some more granularity in terms of those puts and takes. You talked about, you know, some of the gross margin improvement you're expecting in terms of shifting to the seed-based production. You talked about some opex improvements as well. You mentioned greater international, I believe, when you made reference to that as well. So, just in terms of the puts and takes of getting to EBITDA exceeding 2023 for the back half of fiscal 2024, what we should expect in terms of the top-line gross margin and EBITDA to help us get there? Thank you.Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Thanks, Aaron. Let me try to unpack all of that. So, for -- first your question on EBITDA. Yes, you heard that correctly. We'll exceed the EBITDA from fiscal 2023 in the back half of this year. As far as margins and the various puts and takes, first, I'll start with -- in the second quarter. And, you know, we had -- versus the prior year, we had less international. And as you know, international is much higher margin than domestic and does not include any excise duty obligations. Also, during the quarter, our mix skewed toward IPRs, which is good news, and that we're driving leadership in that category. But at the same time, it's a new category for us. So, you know, we're still working out some of the kinks in the production area and really working on improving our production efficiencies there, which we've made good progress on, and we expect to see some movement on that in the back half of this year. Also, in the second quarter, we had lower JOLTS sales, Q2 versus Q1, which also would have been a bit of a drag on margin during the period. So, as we go forward into the back half of the year, you mentioned the seed-based production, that should start flowing through toward Q4. And as Beena mentioned, that's about a 30% to 40% cost reduction. And that's not going to be 30% to 40% in totality, obviously. But, you know, as the -- as we've said before, our plan is, by the end of calendar this year, to have about 30% of the garden seed-based, which we'll see the benefit from. Also, moving forward, we're really working on making operational efficiency improvements in some production areas where we've seen higher than -- higher waste than we would have liked in Q1 and Q2, and that's particularly around tube-style pre-rolls, which, again, is a relatively new process for us. And just in the last number of weeks, we started to see real improvement in that area. We expect to drive that going forward as well. Also, just, you know, the cost savings initiative that we mentioned before, about the 10 million target for the year, we made great progress on that. 5.5 million more to go in the back half around freight, logistics, energy, and also some post-harvest efficiencies that we expect to see coming through. I hope that answers your question there, Aaron.Aaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- Analyst No, it did. No, really appreciate that color there, Greg. Second question for me, right, so you guys have the OBX investment. Within the U.S., there's been a number of public operators, you know, talking more about the hemp-derived beverage market specifically, but also, you know, edibles, including some listed on the Nasdaq, similar to you. So, can you speak, you know, toward your views specifically on the hemp-derived beverage and potentially edibles market, too? You know, given your line of sight with the OBX investment, are you seeing some opportunities there? Is there some ability for you to leverage BAT's distribution? You know, it's not a liquor channel there, but there are still some convenience and maybe some bodegas and otherwise that could be leveraged. So, just your view of the hemp-derived beverage market, you know, how big the opportunity is and if you think there's opportunities for OGI to come within it. Thanks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Thank you, Aaron. So, first of all, we're very excited about the hemp-derived THC market for ingestibles, for both beverages and for edibles. And certainly, our relationship with OBX gives us a first line of sight into the market and the opportunity. We do see there's a patchwork of states in the U.S. that are -- have regulated the Delta-9 THC hemp-derived, and there are some that are perhaps not regulated but are not enforcing. And so, this market continues to grow, and we continue to track how big the opportunity is. What excites us about this is the direct-to-consumer opportunities, that you could move products across state lines. So, there's a lot of very interesting opportunities around the space. We are reviewing what the opportunities are internally. We see the opportunity of using the nanoemulsion technology that we're developing in some of the products that we take to the market in the U.S. at some point in the future and the opportunity to leverage the clinical study that we did to make claims in that market. So, we do think we have a competitive differentiation that we could take so we could enter the market. We are looking at whether it's beverages or edibles, and we're looking at ways to get the product to market. So, nothing in the short term in terms of using the BAT distribution network. We'd be looking at how OBX is getting products out. We'd be looking at other partners that we could leverage. So, let's -- you know, it's still a work in progress, something that we're evaluating as we look out. And obviously, needless to say, everything we do, we're going to make sure that we're compliant with our Nasdaq listing, with our TSX listing. So, this is an area that we're navigating carefully as we look to get some products into the U.S. market.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Bottomley of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.Matt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's well. Yeah, I just had a follow-up question on the reserve you took for that receivable. So, relative to your international contribution, you know, it is sizable, obviously not really material to the company or quarter overall. But I'm just curious if we can get a little more detail on that. Is this biomass that wasn't accepted over in Israel? Is it -- is there a dispute there? Has that product been returned? I'm just trying to get an idea of where that relationship is. And then if Israel is still a market, that will be a focus in the near term.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer No problem, Matt. Let me take that on and say to you that there is no issue with the product that was shipped over. This was a situation where the receivable was due at the end of October, and we all know what happened in that country on October 7th. So, there is a delay in payment. The customer says they'll pay us, but at this point, it's six months past due. And so, we took the reserve on our books. We expect to continue to work with the customer to get a payment plan that we're comfortable with. And, you know, it is our intention to, in due course, get back to shipping to Israel. It's an important market for cannabis, and it's a higher margin market than Canada, as Greg alluded to, in terms of our international growth. And so, it's something that we want to do. But obviously, with the size of the outstanding receivable, we have been on standby at this point and we have stopped shipping until we get this resolved.Matt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst OK. Thanks for that. And just one other question for me, just on the cadence of sort of the adjusted EBITDA rebound for the back half of the year here. I'm just wondering if the sort of cash flow from operations will be linear to that, or will we see an outperformance in sort of the CFO, given the fact that international sales likely have a higher margin and will drive more to the bottom line?Greg Guyatt -- Chief Financial Officer Hey. Thanks for that question, Matt. Right now, we're expecting the cash flow from operations improvement to be roughly linear, and that's really driven by the changes in working capital. And, you know, we are continuing to invest in the business, and we're investing in working capital as well. So, you know, that's really going to be an important driver there beyond just the sales internationally. And for example, over the first quarter, we invested more in inventory than we had in the past in order to make sure that our customer service levels were much higher than they had been. So, this is an example. Our on-time and in-full shipment to the provinces was up to over 95% in Q2 as a result of that investment. So, that's the one caveat to the linear versus sort of exponential following the international.OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Frederico Gomes of ATB Capital Markets. Your line is open.Frederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on Germany. I think, yesterday, there was an article mentioning there was a change in regulations there that could, you know, potentially expedite the second pillar of their legalization plan. So, I'm just curious if you've seen that. Could you comment on it in terms of your expectations for that second pillar, as well as just, you know, in terms of your EU-GMP certification, do you have any sort of timeline for that? Thank you.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer No problem, Fred. So, let me start with the first point. Yes, we have seen the same news around the second pillar of the German legalization progress, and we're excited about that. Really, what that was all about is enabling pilot programs similar to what we've seen in Switzerland, where they're going to allow, you know, to certain, I guess, licensed producers or cannabis companies to have pilot facilities so they could pilot programs so that they could test how the market runs and form some better understanding of the market. We're excited about that. We're talking with some of our customers that we're dealing with in Germany about the opportunities in that market. And this is just, again, another example of the legalization framework opening up in Germany, which we're excited about. It's another big market. So, any progress like this, no different than the DEA rescheduling that they're talking about in the U.S., these are all good macro tailwinds for the industry, and we're excited about the opportunity it presents. In terms of the EU-GMP, we had our preliminary audit back in February, and we were successful with that audit. So, we're now just waiting for confirmation from the regulatory authorities and when they will be coming out to do the final audit. You know, our hope is that it will happen this summer. But, you know, we're kind of not in control of their timeline, so we're just waiting for that to be scheduled.Frederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you for that, Beena. My second question is just you mentioned that, you know, rescheduling in the U.S. could potentially help your U.S.-based strategy in terms of your investments. So, just curious, how exactly could that play out? Is it about the sort of investments that you would be able to pursue and -- while, you know, keeping -- being compliant with your Nasdaq listing, or is it about helping, I guess, your investments that you have already made in the U.S. to perform better? So, just any color on how rescheduling could help you in the U.S. Thanks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. So, again, just to reiterate, look, we think that the whole DEA rescheduling is really a positive move forward that signals, you know, the evolution of the U.S. movement toward federal legalization. So, we're excited about that. Now, it doesn't really help much for us from a compliance position, as you mentioned. With our Nasdaq and TSX listings, we still can't consolidate or control anything that's plant-touching. However, we do think that the --you know, the whole rescheduling is expected to take some time, but it will happen. And we think that this will benefit the two -- our two U.S. investee companies. And, you know, we're invested in them. So, that's a benefit to us. It's still a small amount of benefit at this time. But we think that with the Jupiter fund, we have the opportunity to take advantage of other opportunities in the U.S. market. And so, this is just a positive all around for us as we look to expand our global footprint.OperatorThank you. And with no further questions, that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Beena for closing remarks.Beena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive Officer Well, again, thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. I know that we have some exciting plans ahead, and we do look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. So, with that, I'll end the call.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Max Schwartz -- Director, Investor RelationsBeena Goldenberg -- Chief Executive OfficerGreg Guyatt -- Chief Financial OfficerAaron Grey -- Alliance Global Partners -- AnalystMatt Bottomley -- Canaccord Genuity -- AnalystFrederico Gomes -- ATB Capital Markets -- Analyst\n",

[Operator instructions] And please be advised that today's webinar is being recorded. Before we start the presentation, we would like to remind you that this includes forward-looking statements, which are underlined by a number of risks and uncertainties, and they may not be realized in the future for various reasons.Information about general market conditions is coming from a variety of sources outside of Tencent. This presentation also contains some unaudited non-IFRS financial measures that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures of the group's financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a detailed discussion of risk factors and non-IFRS measures, please refer to our disclosure documents on the IR section of our website. Let me now introduce the management team on the webinar tonight. Our chairman and CEO, Pony Ma, will kick-off with a short overview. President Martin Lau and Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell will provide a business review. Chief Financial Officer John Lo will conclude with a financial discussion before we open the floor for questions. I will now pass it to Pony. Pony Ma -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Wendy. Good evening. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. During the first quarter of 2024, several of our leading games in China and internationally started to benefit from team reorganisations we put in place, resulting in an increase in games gross receipts and creating a foundation for our games revenue to resume growth in future quarters. We continue to cultivate high quality revenue streams, including advertising in video accounts and Weixin Search, mini games platform service fees, and e-commerce technology service fees, contributing to our gross and operating profit growth outpacing our revenue growth. Executing on our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders, we stepped up our buyback plan and are on track to repurchase over 100 billion Hong Kong dollars of our shares in 2024, as well as paying an increased dividend, while investing in AI technology, platform enhancements, and high production value content. Looking at our financial numbers for the quarter. Total revenue was 160 billion RMB, up 6% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. Gross profit was 84 billion RMB, up 23% year on year and 8% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was 59 billion RMB, up 30% year on year and 19% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 50 billion RMB, up 54% year on year and 18% quarter on quarter. Turning to our key services. For communication and social networks. Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat grew year on year and quarter on quarter to 1.36 billion. For digital content, which reinforces our leadership in long-form video and music streaming, as Tencent Video and TME subscriptions grew year on year. For games, we made proactive adjustments driving initial recovery for our flagship games in China and international markets while several games in our portfolio achieved record highs in gross receipts during the quarter. For cloud, international and domestic clients from media, entertainment, and live streaming industries increasingly use Tencent Cloud media services. Our enterprise SaaS products, WeCom and Tencent Meeting, [Inaudible] functionalities and increase their adoption by enterprise customers. I will now hand over to Martin for a business review.Martin Lau -- President Thank you, Pony. Good evening, and good morning to everybody. For the first quarter of 2024, our total revenue was up 6% year on year. VAS represented 49% of our total revenue, within which social networks subsegment was 19%, domestic games segment was 22% ,and international games was 8%. Online advertising was 17% of total revenue, and fintech and business services was 33% of total revenue. Our overall gross profit growth, which we consider as a key proxy for our organic growth, was 23% year on year in the first quarter, faster than first half of 2021 when our revenue growth rates were much higher. This was driven by the rapid growth of high-margin revenue streams, including video accounts and Weixin Search advertising, wealth management services, mini games, platform service fees, and e-commerce technology service fees. Improved cost efficiency in our long-form video and cloud businesses also contributed to higher gross profit. By segment, VAS gross profit increased 5% year on year to 45 billion RMB, representing 54% of our total gross profit. Online advertising gross profit increased 66% year on year to 15 billion RMB, contributing 17% of total gross profit. And fintech and business services gross profit increased 42% year on year to 24 billion RMB, contributing 28% of total gross profit. For value-added services, segment revenue was 79 billion RMB, down 1% year on year. Social networks revenue was down 2% year on year to 31 billion RMB. Revenue from music subscriptions, video accounts live streaming, mini games, and video subscriptions increased while revenue from music and games related to live streaming services declined sharply. Long-form video subscription revenue increased 12% year on year. Average daily video subscriptions increased 8% year on year to 116 million benefiting from popular self-commission to drama series and animated series, such as Blossoms Shanghai, The Hunter, and Perfect World Season 4. Music subscription revenue increased 39% year on year, reflecting growth in subscriptions and ARPU. TME strengthened collaboration with Tencent Video and released original sound track of the popular drama series, The Legend of Shen Li. Domestic games revenue was down 2% year on year to 35 billion RMB. Increased revenue from VALORANT, Fight of the Golden Spatula, and Lost Ark was offset by decreased revenue from Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite. As Honour of Kings faced a tough comparison against Chinese New Year of 2023 and Peacekeeper Elite to revenue in the first -- in the quarter reflected weak monetisable content releases in recent quarters. However, total gross receipts of domestic games in the first quarter increased 3% year on year, showing a general recovery trend. International games revenue increased 3% year on year to 14 billion RMB or stable in constant-currency terms. On the other hand, gross receipts increased by 34% year on year, driven by PUBG Mobile and Supercell's games contributions. The growth rate of revenue lagged behind gross receipts due to long deferral periods for Supercell's games. Moving on to communications and social networks. For Weixin, users are increasingly supplementing their stable consumption of social graph supply content in chat and Moments with consumption of algorithmically recommended content in official accounts and video accounts and engagement with Mini Programs' diverse range of services. This trend benefits from our heavy investment in AI, which makes the recommendation better and better over time. For official accounts, which enable creators to share text and images on chosen topics with interested followers, it achieved healthy year-on-year page view growth as AI-powered recommendation algorithms allow us to provide targeted high-quality content more effectively. Mini programs have become an increasingly powerful platform for merchants and content providers to engage users online and offline. Total user time spent on mini programs grew over 20% year on year in the first quarter. Among non-game use cases, daily activations increased at double-digit rate year on year, particularly in the productivity tools, dining services, and transportation. For Mini Games, gross receipts increased 30% year on year with notable growth from new releases as well as games released for over three years. Video accounts user time spent grew 80% year on year in the first quarter. Time spent on video accounts is now over two times that of Moments. We also strengthened our live streaming e-commerce ecosystem by diversifying merchandise categories and enabling more content creators to monetize to e-commerce activities. Now, with that, I'll pass to James.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Thank you, Martin. Moving on to domestic games with our two flagship games, we highlighted last-quarter proactive adjustments we made, including spreading out the timing of high-value virtual item sales through the year and enhancing content design. While their revenues declined in the first quarter, we can see these adjustments are starting to yield results with gross receipts for each of Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite increasing year on year in March. Several of our other games achieved notable milestones during the first quarter. Fight of the Golden Spatula delivered record DAU and ranked third by gross receipts across all mobile games in China during the quarter, driven by popular content updates, including new Chibi Champions and a customizable arena. CrossFire Mobile achieved all-time highs in paying users and gross receipts this quarter, benefiting from new PBE content and an enhanced rewards system. And Arena Breakout achieved new milestones in DAU, paying users, and gross receipts as we released an enlarged map with vehicles and introduced armor and weapons inspired by ancient Chinese culture. We aim to release several high-production value games this year including DnF Mobile next week, Tarisland, Need for Speed Mobile, One Piece Mobile, and Delta Force: Hawk Operations. Among our international games, PUBG Mobile increased DAU and gross receipts by double-digit percentage rates year on year in the first quarter, benefiting from popular new modes and featured events such as the Shadow Force Mode and Golden Moon Event. Notably, PUBG Mobile is evolving from a game product into a game platform with increasing user time spent on new modes beyond the original Battle Royale, notably the extraction shooter mode Metro Royale. Brawl Stars' average DAU more than doubled year on year, and gross receipts more than quadrupled year on year in the first quarter. The game ranked the third highest mobile game by DAU globally ex China in March. Supercell expanded Brawl Star's development team, enabling the creation of a new five-versus-five mode, a simplified reward system, and successful community events. Warframe achieved record-high gross receipts in the first quarter with the introduction of a new faster-moving war frame, the Gauss Prime. For online advertising, our revenue was 26.5 billion renminbi in the quarter, up 26% year on year, benefiting from increased engagements in AI-powered ad targeting. Outspend from all major categories, except automotive, increased year on year, particularly from games, internet services, and consumer goods sectors. During the quarter, we upgraded our ad tech platform to help advertisers manage ad campaigns more effectively, and we made generative AI-powered ad creation tools available to all advertisers. These initiatives enable advertisers to create ads more efficiently and to deliver better targeting. For Weixin, video account ad revenue grew over 100% year on year due to higher video views and click-through rates. Mini Programs ad revenue grew over 40% year on year, benefiting among other features from mini games closed-loop effect, whereby mini game developers both boost demand, being substantial advertisers themselves, but also creates supply as the mini games provide high CPM rewarded video ad inventory. On content platforms, our long-form video ad revenue increased at a double-digit rate year on year as popular self-commissioned drama series attracted marketing budgets. Looking at fintech and business services, segment revenue was 52 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year. Fintech services revenues slowed to a single-digit year-on-year growth rate. For payments, commercial payment growth moderated due to slow off-line consumption spending with draw fee revenue decreased year on year as consumers are increasingly funding commercial transactions with their Weixin cash balances and placing these cash balances in money market funds rather than withdrawing the cash balances to bank accounts, which triggers the withdraw fee revenue. For wealth management, revenue grew robustly year on year with rapid increases in the number of users and average fund investments per user, primarily invested in low-risk money market funds. Turning to business services, revenue grew at a teens rate year on year in the first quarter, benefiting from higher cloud services revenue and increased technology service fee contribution due to rising video accounts e-commerce transactions. Business services gross profit more than doubled year on year due to increased contributions from higher-margin revenue streams plus improved efficiency. Domestic and international clients, especially from the media entertainment and live streaming industries, are increasingly adopting our integrated audio and video cloud solution for Tencent Cloud Media Services, which achieved over 50% year-on-year revenue growth. IDC recognized Tencent Cloud Media Services as the market leader in its sector for the sixth consecutive year. Among our enterprise SaaS products in WeCom, merchants are increasingly willing to pay for use of customer communication functionality. As a result, WeCom revenue tripled year on year. For Tencent Meeting, we're driving adoption and upselling among enterprise clients, and Tencent Meeting revenue doubled year on year. And for Hunyuan, the main model achieved significant progress as we've scaled up using a mixture of experts approach, and we're deploying Hunyuan in more of our services. Today, we announced that we're making a version of Hunyuan providing text-to-image generative AI available on an open source basis. And with that, I'll pass to John.John Lo -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, James. Hi, everybody. For the first quarter of 2024, total revenue was 159.5 billion renminbi, up 6% year on year. Gross profit was 83.9 billion renminbi, up 23% year on year. Operating profit was 32.6 billion renminbi, up 38% year on year. Interest income was 4.2 billion renminbi, up 43% year on year, driven by growth in cash reserves and high interest yield. Finance costs were 2.8 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year, due to higher interest expenses. Share of profit of associates and JVs was 2.2 billion renminbi, up from profit of 0.1 billion renminbi in the same period last year. On a non-IFRS basis, share of profit was 5.5 billion renminbi versus loss of 0.1 billion renminbi last year, driven by better profitability at certain domestic associates and reduced losses at certain overseas associates. Income tax expense rose by 24% year on year to 14.1 billion renminbi, primarily driven by operating profit growth and higher provision for withholding tax. IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 41.9 billion renminbi, up 62% year on year. Diluted EPS was 4.386 renminbi, up 66% year on year. On non-IFRS financial figures, operating profit was 58.6 billion renminbi, up 30% year on year. Net profit attributable to equity holders was 50.3 billion renminbi, up 34% year on year. The difference in year-on-year growth rates between operating profit and net profit was mainly due to non-IFRS share of profit from associates and JVs, which amounted to 5.5 billion renminbi this quarter, compared to loss -- share of loss of 0.1 billion renminbi in the same quarter last year. Diluted EPS was 5.263 renminbi, up 57% year on year, outpacing non-IFRS net profit growth, mainly due to reduced share count from share buybacks. For the first quarter of 2024, our weighted average number of shares for calculating diluted EPS decreased by 1.8% year on year. Moving on to gross margins. Overall gross margin was 53%, up 7 percentage points year on year. By segment, VAS gross margin was 57%, up 3 percentage points year on year. This was due to growth in subscription revenues and increase in high-margin mini game platform service fees and certain content cost and operating cost savings. Online advertising gross margin increased to 55%, up 13 percentage points year on year, primarily driven by growth in our video accounts and Weixin Search advertising revenues. Fintech and business services gross margin increased to 46%, up 11 percentage points year on year. This was driven by higher contribution from high-margin wealth management services revenue and e-commerce technology service fee, improved monetization of WeCom and other business services, and increased cost efficiency in our cloud businesses. On first-quarter operating expenses, selling and marketing expenses were 7.5 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year, driven by increased spending on promotion and advertising for new content release. The total represented 5% of revenues, stable year on year. R&D expenses were 15.7 billion renminbi, up 3% year on year. G&A expenses, excluding R&D, were 9.1 billion renminbi, down 3% year on year due to lower staff costs, including share-based compensation expenses and reduced operating lease and office expenses. At quarter-end, we had approximately 105,000 employees, down 1% both year on year and quarter on quarter. Let's look at our first-quarter non-IFRS margin ratios. So, non-IFRS operating margin was 37%, up 7 percentage points year on year. Non-IFRS net margin was 32%, up 10 percentage points year on year. To conclude, I will highlight some key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating capex was 6.6 billion renminbi, up 557% year on year from a low base quarter last year, mainly driven by investment in GPUs and servers to support our Hunyuan and AI app recommendation algorithms. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, operating capex was down 1%. Nonoperating capex was 7.8 billion renminbi, up 127% year on year due to acquisition of land use rights during the quarter. As a result, total capex was 14.4 billion renminbi, up 226% year on year. Free cash flow was 51.9 billion renminbi, largely stable year on year or up 52% quarter on quarter, primarily due to higher gross receipts from games. Net cash position was 92.5 billion renminbi, up 69% year on year, reflecting strong free cash generation, partially offset by 13.5 billion cash out for share repurchase during the quarter. Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, John. We shall now open the floor for questions. [Operator instructions] We will take one main question, up to one follow-up question each time. The first question comes from Kenneth Fong from UBS.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on online game. Last quarter, we highlighted one of our key strategy is to rejuvenate our key titles. That is showcasing the robust performance on the Supercell game, the recovery of PUBG. Given our rich IP portfolio and strong experience in executing online game, can management share with us how to think about the potential and growth plan ahead and how we can replicate the success to our other IPs and titles? And I have a follow-up question on the buyback side. Last quarter, we have completed at least 100 billion of buyback last quarter. Given our share price have -- has been going up very meaningfully since last quarter, how should we think about the pace of the buyback? Would it be more share-price dependent or any other factors that we should consider? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Kenneth. Thank you for the question. Perhaps I'll take the one on games and Martin on buybacks. So, for games, as you observed, we have been in the process of rejuvenating some of our key games. And we believe that process is well underway now. We are confident in the progress of that process. And there's a couple of learnings that we derive from our experience along this journey. One is that -- what we classify as evergreen games truly do appear to be capable of growing new shoots and, indeed, rejuvenating themselves as evergreen trees should. And a good example would be Brawl Stars, where we cited, not only the quadrupling of gross receipts, but also the doubling -- more than doubling of daily active users. A second learning is that in the event that, again, which we believe should be an evergreen title is stagnating, then the problem is usually not with the nature of the game. It's with the nature of the team running the game. And we need to make changes to the team, and sometimes, the changes are changing mindsets, sometimes the change is a change in people. And what we find is that when we make those changes, then we see positive results flow quite quickly. And if we don't see the positive results slow, then we make further changes. But the games themselves, these big competitive multiplayer games are inherently evergreen just as key sports, such as football, basketball, are inherently evergreen. And with the right people running the games, then we get the right results.Martin Lau -- President In terms of the buyback, we have committed to buying back at least 100 billion Hong Kong dollars of our stock as we announced last time. And since then, the buyback has been done on a pretty consistent basis. At this point in time, I don't think the buyback is share-price dependent because it is true that the share price has come up quite a bit. But if you look at the share price when it was announced, it was pretty incredible. And so, even today, without the share price, it's still attractive, given the fact that our profit has increased quite substantially, given the fact that the value of our investment portfolio has been increasing, and also given the fact that our long-term prospect is actually very good. So, that's why we'll continue to pursue our share buyback at this point in time.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you, and congrats on the very strong set of results.Martin Lau -- President Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, Kenneth. Next, we will move to Thomas Chong from Jefferies.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Good evening. Thanks, management, for taking my question. And congratulations on a strong set of result. My first question is about our advertising business. We see a very good set of momentum in the first quarter. How should we think about our market share gain story and the as tech upgrade on the back of macro recovery? How are we actually seeing the ad sentiment as we come to June 18th? And on video accounts, how should we ambition the advertising growth momentum over the next few years and the strength of live streaming e-commerce GMV growth to drive our ad revenue? And my second question is about our high-quality growth strategy. Given our high-quality growth strategy standout and our strong earnings growth momentum, how should we expect our earnings growth and margin trend over the next few years? Should we expect there might be some point that we need to go back to have more reinvestment? And in terms of opex, how should we think about S&M expenses over the next few quarters, given that we have more content and new game releases? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Thomas. So, on your first question around advertising, I'd say that, as you would expect, given the economy is mixed, advertiser sentiment is also quite mixed. And it's certainly a challenging environment in which to set advertising. The first quarter for us is a slightly unusual quarter because it's a small quarter for advertising due to the Chinese New Year effect. And so, sometimes the accelerations or the decelerations get magnified as a result. So, we would expect our advertising growth to be less rapid in subsequent quarters of the year than it was in the first quarter and more similar to consensus expectations for our advertising revenue growth for the rest of the year. But that said, we think that we are in a good position to continue taking share of the market at a rapid rate, given we're very early in increasing our ad load on video accounts, which is currently around one-quarter of the outloads of our major competitors with short video products. And also given we're early in capturing the benefits of deploying AI to our ad tech stack -- and we think that we will -- we are benefiting and will continue to benefit disproportionately from applying AI to our ad tech because historically, as a social media platform, our click-through rates were low. And so, starting from that lower base, we can -- we have seen we can double or triple click-through rates in a way that's not possible for ad services that are starting from much higher click-through rates. So, overall, we remain quite constructive on our ability to grow our advertising revenue at a decent rate, and we believe we'll also continue to take market share irrespective of the overall advertising market conditions. Thank you. Martin Lau -- President In terms of the high-quality growth strategy, I do want to clarify that we have always been pursuing a strategy and philosophy of investing in the platform and investing in our user experience and products and monetize on a gradual basis. So, the fact that we can now unleash a lot of these growth drivers is not because we are milking our platform or harvesting our platform. It's because of the fact that we have always been investing in our platform, and this is a continuous action. So, I think that's actually very important. The reason the high-quality growth driver has become clearer is because we have -- we have actually pruned our business of the lower-quality products and services and the distractions, if you will, in our businesses so that we can actually focus on our core platforms and, at the same time, make the growth drivers more obvious and apparent. And we do believe that these growth drivers, be it video accounts advertising or Weixin Search advertising or value-added services on top of our payment platform and, over time, the e-commerce service fees, these -- sort of a pretty long runway going forward. And we have always also been investing in new areas that can serve as growth drivers for the future, including AIs, including new games, including Weixin e-commerce, and SaaS products, just to name a few. So, we felt, over time, our gross margin should actually continue to benefit from the continued increase of these high-quality revenues. And that has a pretty long runway. Now, in terms of sales and marketing, I'll pass to John to answer that question.John Lo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, this -- well, to recap, the selling and marketing expenses grew by 17% year on year. And we expect that the year-on-year growth will be at a lower rate, somewhere from low to mid teens in 2024. Having said that, promotion advertising expense is something that we can adjust up and down dynamically according to our needs. And if we can -- if we identify some services or products that we need to invest, we will definitely do it. But with the cost optimization, culture, and mechanism in mind, we will definitely assess the ROI rigorously.Wendy Huang Thank you. Next, we will take the question from Alicia Yap from Citigroup.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the solid quarter. Two questions. First is on the gaming. So, with the positive growth in the grossing of HoK, Peacekeeper, and also several games also achieving record-high growth in receipts this quarter -- so, the strong growth in the deferred should also work well for the upcoming revenue growth in the coming quarters. Is there any outstanding adjustment that is still ongoing? Or are there any risk or uncertainty on the gaming business that we need to be concerned or worry about? And second question is -- wondering if there's any chance the games, application, or the digital content application by Tencent or other developers in China could see an improvement in the app store revenue sharing arrangement in the coming quarter that might support further uptake in the gross margin for the VAS. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Alicia. Thank you for your questions and for the congratulations. So, on the first question around the games, then -- yes, the deferred revenue growth is a positive leading indicator for game reported revenue growth. No, we don't see particular risks to call out. We believe, with the structural changes we have made, we have somewhat derisked the game business. And therefore, looking forward, our focus will be on execution of the new strategy for the existing games and successfully launching the several major new games we've identified in our pipeline. In terms of your second question around app store revenue sharing ratios, then we do believe that app stores are currently over-earning at the expense of app providers, including ourselves, both in China and even more so internationally. But for the purposes of our business plan, we assume that those revenue-sharing arrangements remain as they are today. Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, Alicia. We will take the next question from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley. Gary, your line is open.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you, management, for taking my question. And congratulations on a solid set of results. I have a follow-up questions on the game business, and thank you for the earlier comment regarding what we learned from the evergreen games. On the same note, what have we learned in terms of whenever we see potential new games launched? What's the management strategy to try to kind of cultivate the games into our next evergreen game, I think, particularly on the domestic side, we have DnF Mobile coming up. And then on the international side, we may have more games coming up. So, how should we look at the strategy for new games launched going forward? And my second question is also a follow-up question on margin upside. Across these business segments, how should we look at the sustainable kind of margin level going forward, given it seems like the margin upside is across the border cross business segments? So, how should we look at the kind of relative margin trend going forward for different segments? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Yes. So, on your question about new games, the game industry is a challenging industry for new games because as the evergreen games become better and better, then every new game is competing, not only against other new games released around the same time, but also against every existing game or the best of all the existing games that have survived and evolved to become evergreen games. And that's true on PC, it's true on mobile, it's true on console, it's true in China, it's increasingly true internationally as well, where you can see the time spent on the big consoles is more and more centered around the gigantic evergreen games like Fortnite, like Call of Duty. And so, our response to that is to continually raise the bar on the new games we actually bring to market and focus on fewer but bigger and better new games. And not every new game we bring to market has a high probability of becoming evergreen. There are some new games we will bring to market which are more consciously content-driven games, which will have a cycle associated with them. And that's fine. They can still be successful profitable games that players enjoy and love. But for those games that we do aspire to the status of evergreen games, then the metrics we focus on are not the metrics that you may find most visible externally, such as the hype, the excitement, the downloads, the first-day revenues. Rather, we look at metrics of their engagement, such as the retention rates. And it is those leading indicators that tell us when a game is a new game that has a moderate launch and will fade away after a year or two versus when there's a new game that also has a moderate launch but goes from strength to strength, which is what we've seen with Fight of the Golden Spatula. As you mentioned, despite a fairly secured start, it's now the third-biggest mobile game in China behind two of our other games. So, those are some of the thoughts we have and policies we have around new game launches.Martin Lau -- President Gary, on your question around the sustainability of margins for each segment, it's really a number of factors are at play, including competitive conditions, macroeconomic conditions, seasonality. But I think the most important factor over the longer term is the mix of products and businesses within that segment. And so, you can see that for all three of our big segments, but particularly for advertising and fintech and business services, there's been positive mix shifts underway, away from lower-margin revenue streams and toward higher-margin revenue streams. And as Martin articulated, we see those positive mix shifts continuing for years to come for all three of our segments. And therefore, we believe that both the margins where they are and also the upward margin trends are sustainable.Wendy Huang Thank you, Gary. We will take the next question from Ana [Inaudible] from [Inaudible] Securities.Unknown speaker Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. My name is Ana [Inaudible] from [Inaudible], and it's actually my first time to ask a question. So, the first question I want to ask management is we saw Meta improve their Advantage+ advertising tool based on the large language models. And we wonder if management can share more on how Tencent plans to use AI to improve the ad business. And also, in the future, do you think like under the AI developments like our competitors such as Baidu [Inaudible] or Alibaba, they also apply AI to their ad business. So, how do you think that AI will drive to add market share to change in the longer term? So, this is my first question. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Great. Welcome to joining our Q&A, Ana. I'll take the first question, although it might be a supplement. But we believe that tools like Advantage+ is extremely important in terms of helping social media companies, whether it's Meta or ourselves, grow into being all that they can be on the advertising front because they simplify and automate the advertising, buying and advertising targeting processes, so that the social media companies can deliver experiences to advertisers that are more competitive with those that had already been delivered by search engines and by e-commerce platforms but with the advantage that the social media platforms have much greater time spent user engagements than search engines or e-commerce platforms. And so, to the second part of your question around a number of competitors are obviously applying AI as well, and we believe that all of them will benefit from AI, too. But we think that the biggest beneficiaries will be those companies, of which we are one, that have very substantial under-monetized time spent and now able to monetize that time spend more effectively by deploying AI because the deployment of AI enables an upward structural shift in click-through rates. And that shift is most pronounced for those inventories where the click-through rates were lower to begin with, such as the social media inventory. Those tools also allow advertisers who previously were able to create advertisements for search, which are text in nature but not to create advertisements for social media, which are image and video in nature, to now use generative AI to create advertisements in social media. So, in general, we think there'll be a reallocation of advertising spend toward those services, which have high time spent, high engagement, and are now able to deliver increasing click-through rates, increasing transaction volume more commensurate with the time spent and engagement superiority. Thank you.Unknown speaker Thank you so much. I do have a follow-up question toward -- recently, I noticed, actually Meta, they announced their -- the Meta AI function and the rollout to automated products such as WhatsApp and like Facebook, Messenger, etc. And do you think that in the future of Tencent, because we have such a great network product environment, will we have a similar product like Meta AI?Martin Lau -- President Well, I think we do believe that with the right product than our WeChat platform and our other products, which have a lot of user engagement, would be great -- will be great distribution channels for these AI products. But I think at this point in time, everybody is actually trying out different products that may work. No one has really come up with a killer application yet with the exception of probably OpenAI [Inaudible]. So, I think you should be confident that we have been developing the technology, and we are having a best-in-class technology in Hunyuan. And at the same time, we are actively creating and testing out different products to see what would make sense for our existing products. And as the time comes, these products will be rolled out on our platform.Unknown speaker Thank you so much. I'm sorry. Can I just have one more additional question because we're really excited for Tencent. And recently --Wendy Huang I'm sorry. In the interest of time, we need to save the time -- only two for each analyst.Unknown speaker OK. Thank you. All right. OK.Wendy Huang Thank you. So, we will take the next question from John Choi from Daiwa.John Choi -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst Hey. Well, thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on a great set of results. I have a question about your business services on cloud. I realized that some of your new business at WeCom, revenue tripled. Tencent Meeting also doubled. Are we seeing more of an acceleration trend in terms of our adapting our services? And in terms of -- given that cloud business is also very sensitive to macro conditions, are your customers now opening up or more warmed up on using our services as a result? Hopefully, we should see this kind of accelerated toward the remaining part of the year. And I have a quick follow-up question on your wealth management. I think this has been one of the key drivers of your growth on fintech services. Can you kind of elaborate a bit more about our strategy here, what we -- where we need to invest? And what kind of further areas in terms of margins where you could benefit from this part of the business, but also what kind of investments that is required to further cultivate further development here? Thank you.Martin Lau -- President In terms of SaaS, I think what we have seen is our initial success in monetizing these products, which we have been offering as a free service for a long time. And that's actually off a relatively low base. So, I think we look at it more as validation -- an early validation of the fact that we can get paid for some SaaS services in China. So, we really started from a base case of enterprises are not paying for software, which is very different from established markets like the U.S. And we're starting to monetize some value-added services offered to enterprises. But I think this is still early stage. This is still not a big amount of money that we're talking about, compared to what enterprise software have been able to achieve in the U.S. And I think it will continue to be a very long way for us to grow such revenue. So, I don't think it's an acceleration of monetization. It's more of a validation of the initial case. And from that point on, we would grow it consistently, but we haven't really reached the inflection point yet. But we'll continue to invest in these SaaS services because we felt this is a great service in itself. It's actually providing great connection for us with the enterprise customers, which we can cross-sell other of our cloud and enterprise services. And at the same time, we felt at some point in time, maybe in not the very near future, that inflection point will come, and we want to be the most competitive and leading player at the time when the inflection point comes. Now, in terms of the wealth management service, mainly our customers putting their money into money market funds in which we offered alongside with fund management companies. And so, instead of our customers withdrawing the money into their bank accounts or spending the money, they actually put these money in money market funds. And we have seen an increasing trend around that partly because of the fact that there are many more use cases within our payment platform so that people are getting used to putting more money within the platform and partly because there is reduced willingness for consumers to spend. So, they actually save more rather than spend more. And I think on this front, what we want to do is continue to build up our payment platform so that people are comfortable in entrusting us with more of their wealth, and they can have more use cases so that they can use it for different purposes. That would increase the propensity for people to park the money with us. And we'll continue to work with more fund management companies so that they can offer good money market as well as other wealth management products and services to our customers. But at the same time, we also want to make sure that we invest heavily in risk management so that we really have a very close look and watch over the safety of the wealth for our customers. So, all these things are being pursued at the same time. So, if we can do all these, we believe this service will continue to grow on a consistent basis.Wendy Huang We will take the next question from Charlene Liu from HSBC. Charlene, your line is open. Charlene, can you hear us? OK, maybe we will move to the next question, to Ronald Keung from Goldman Sachs.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you Wendy, and thank you Pony, Martin, James, and John for the sharing. I have two questions. One is I asked about the video accounts and mini program last year on e-commerce, so I want to hear, where do we see we are innovating most in terms of ad tech? We've read about -- you've talked about ad tech upgrades, so will we leverage video accounts, live streaming, and mini program, maybe on an ROI-based ad products? Then I have a follow-up question.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Ronald. On ad tech, we're innovating around the process of targeting the ads using artificial intelligence. We're innovating around helping advertisers manage their advertising campaigns, and then most recently we have been -- we are now deploying Hunyuan to facilitate advertisers creating their advertising content, so those are three areas where we're driving innovation that are contributing to the rapid revenue growth you're seeing for our advertising business.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. And then my follow-up question is on our investment portfolio. Given it's very sizable, nearly $130 billion in value, do we have any thinking on consistent or any distribution policies after the JV and Meituan distributions in the past? I'm thinking about any predictable policies so that the market will more actively value this part of the value, given the substantial market value within Tencent. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer On that front, we have been working with some of our investee companies, and many of them have been working unprompted by themselves to enhance their profitability, and so if you look at the non-IFRS associate income that we reported this quarter of a little over 5 billion renminbi, that's up very sharply year on year, and it annualizes to a number in the 20s of billions renminbi. To the extent that investors are valuing Tencent's overall earnings at a certain multiple, then implicitly, they're now valuing our investment portfolio at several hundred billion renminbi. There is still a gap between that implicit valuation through our multiple and the associate income contributing to our multiple of several hundred billion renminbi versus the intrinsic value or the market value of the portfolio, which is substantially higher, but as the associates -- as companies like Pinduoduo become steadily more profitable, then more and more that gap will narrow itself as the profitability of the associates gets directly reflected in our own net income.Martin Lau -- President At this point in time, we don't really have a plan to distribute any stock for now. As a matter of fact, you can see in the past few years, we have been investing most of our cash flow into our investment portfolio, And that's at a time when the market was seeing very fast growth and there were new companies being formed and grew to very large size. And as a result, we actually benefited a lot from investing in these companies. At the same time, the investment also helped us a lot in terms of building ecosystems on our core platform. So, if you look at, for example games, we have been able to invest in a lot of game studios, which helped us to get access to international markets as well as get a hold of a lot of evergreen and large titles. In the music industry, for example, we have invested in Spotify and also upstream in order for us to establish a very strong position for TME in China. On the payment side, we have actually invested in companies which actually contributed to a lot of use cases. Both strategically and financially, the investment portfolio has actually generated a lot of return for the shareholders, but now it has reached a very big size and some of the companies, as it matures, we actually distribute. And now, given the size of the portfolio, we don't actually envision we're going to have to put additional money into it. If we need to pursue new initiatives, we can actually recycle some of the investments within the portfolio, so the contribution to the shareholder value is that the free cash flow of the company can actually be used for shareholder enhancing activities, such as dividend paying and share buyback. That's the way we think about it. Thanks.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, Martin.Wendy Huang Thank you, Ronald. We have successfully reconnected with Charlene Liu from HSBC. Charlene, your line is open.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Thank you so much, Wendy. Really appreciate the opportunity. I have two questions. I think first is about the application of Hunyuan, management has --Martin Lau -- President We can't hear. Can you repeat that question?Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Yes. Can you hear me OK? Yeah. So, management has spoken quite extensively on how Hunyuan can benefit the ad business. Can we talk about application of AI onto the game business, and how does management expect --Martin Lau -- President We can't hear her. Sorry, we can't hear her.Wendy Huang Sorry. Charlene, your line is not stable. Maybe we will catch up offline.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Is it better? Sorry. Is it better?Martin Lau -- President Yeah. One more try, maybe.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst OK, sorry. Thank you so much, really appreciate this. Can we talk about Hunyuan's potential application on the game business, and how does management expect that to play a larger role to help in game production? It doesn't -- OK, sorry. Thank you for the opportunity.Martin Lau -- President I think for Hunyuan, the --Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Game production --Martin Lau -- President It can be assisting game business in multiple ways. Right now, the best contributor is actually on the customer service front. When Hunyuan is actually deployed to answer questions and be a customer service bot for a lot of our games, it's actually achieving very high customer satisfaction level. And AI in general has already been deployed in our games but not necessarily the generative-AI technology yet. In terms of Hunyuan, I think over time, when we actually can move Hunyuan into a multi-model, and especially if we can start creating really high quality, high fidelity videos, then that would actually be helpful. Before that happens, then Hunyuan can actually be used in NPCs and create certain interactive experiences, but it's not going to be able to take over the very heavy growth of content creation in gaming yet. I think it probably will be a couple more generations before it can be deployed for gaming production.Wendy Huang Thank you, Charlene. We will follow up with you on your other questions. So, next, we will move to Alex Yao from JPMorgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thank you, management team, for taking our question, and congrats on a strong quarter. I have two questions. Number one is on the fintech business. Can you elaborate the slowdown of the fintech business, perhaps decompose the business into payment and non-payment? And also, how should we think about the medium term growth outlook for the fintech business as a whole? The second question is on the Weixin Search, which seems to be picking up monetization momentum in recent quarters. Can you discuss strategy to monetize Weixin Search activities? It would be great if you could share with us some of the operating metrics, just to help us understand the length of the runway. Thank you.Martin Lau -- President In terms of fintech, I think most of the reason for the slowdown is actually the headwind on offline consumption. We felt this is a phenomenon which you probably see across many other industries as well. We felt -- as a whole, the government is actually putting in a lot of stimulus to revive the economy, to revive consumption confidence, and at some point in time we believe this headwind will actually turn. But before it turns, then I think our fintech revenue on the payment side, which forms the bulk of the revenue of fintech, would actually be slow in terms of its growth. And on the other hand, in terms of the withdrawal fee, I would say this is anyway a low quality revenue. The withdrawal fee is essentially people pulling money out of the system, and that will be one-time revenue, but then the money actually leaves the system. When people withdraw less, then the money would actually stay within our system for longer. It will not generate an immediate revenue upon withdrawal, but it will be turned into an asset under management and would continue to generate wealth management fees over time. So, that actually turns into a longer term high value-added revenue. In terms of wealth management services, I think it will continue to grow for the reasons that I talked about earlier. For loan generation fees, I think we are getting a little bit more cautious as there is a macro headwind, and we want to be very vigilant on risk management. So, that's how we look at the different components of the fintech revenue. And what was the other question?Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Weixin Search.Martin Lau -- President In terms of Weixin Search, I think it's a service which has been growing in terms of the usage and in terms of the search volume on a very healthy rate, so the service itself is growing. And we have been monetizing that service on a relatively light basis. In fact, it just started last year that we started monetizing Weixin Search. So, with the combination of the fact that there is a very large engagement with Weixin and the fact that Weixin Search itself is actually growing in volume and that there is an expanding content ecosystem within Weixin, be it official accounts, be it mini programs, be it video accounts, and we're relatively early in the monetization cycle, all these factors will contribute to a pretty long runway in terms of our continued growth of the search revenue on Weixin.Wendy Huang Thank you. In the interests of time, we will take the last question from Robin Zhu from Bernstein. Robin, your line is open.Robin Zhu -- Bernstein -- Analyst Thank you. Hi, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just two, please. One, James, I think at one point, you said that you think video accounts monetization could be as big as Moments. Now that video accounts engagement is 2x of Moments, could I get your thoughts on the intensity of ad revenue per engagement? And is there any reason why the two couldn't equalize, meaning that actually total monetization of video accounts ends up being much larger than Moments compared to what you said, I think, a year or two ago now? Then secondly on games. I think different members of management have been critical about the internal game development process, and just wanted to get your thoughts on we have a pretty full pipeline, it looks like, for the rest of the year, does that mean -- or in your mind, do you think that the issues over the last few years have now resolved and we should look forward to a more consistent launch pipeline in the second half and in future years? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Robin. Thank you for your question. On the first one, yes, I think objectively, you can see from the results of companies like Meta that operate both traditional feel and also a short video feed, that over time that the monetization for short video feed converges with or overtakes the monetization of the traditional social feed. And we feel that's the trajectory we're on as well. With regards to the second question, we do feel we've debugged some of the more obvious challenges. No doubt there's other challenges we haven't identified or other challenges that would arise in the future. And so, it is an iterative debugging process that will never stop. But we feel we've gone -- we've resolved the big immediate challenges, and that is translating into both better engagement and monetization trends with our existing games and also to greater confidence in our pipeline of new games. You made a reference to our internal game development process. And I think that it's easy for outsiders looking at Tencent to assume that there is one game development process, there is one game publishing process, there is one game operating mindset, and so forth. And I can understand why that belief exists. But in reality, it's a little bit like looking at Disney and assuming that the Disney animation studio, the Pixar studio, the 20th Century Fox studio all operate in a homogenous way, which is not the case. If you look at Tencent's five biggest games, one of them is created by a team in Chungdu, one of them is created by a team in Shenzhen, one of them is created by a team in Helsinki, two of them are created by teams in Los Angeles. It's a truly global business, globally distributed, globally different practices. And so, there is no single unified internal game development process. Of course, we try to share best practices and learnings between the big development studios that have created these enormous -- these successful games. But equally, each of those studios that I talked about, each in a different part of the country or the world, still has its own unique attributes, and that's part of their strength. And those strengths, we aim to reinforce over time. That's what I'd say on the game process debugging side.Martin Lau -- President Yes. I just want to add, you actually used the word critical on the game teams. I don't think that's really true. I think there are a lot of things our game teams have done right, but there's just no perfect team, so no perfect games. And we are continuously going through the process of debugging, and we are more transparent and honest on those efforts with the outside world. So, that's the reason why we discuss about what are the changes that we have done to our game teams or to our games. And we also believe some of the major titles that we have are really evergreen titles, such that we don't necessarily blame it on the life cycle of a game when it doesn't work but rather look at what exactly are the bugs or are the untapped potentials that we can actually sort of make changes, so that we can actually get the games to be really evergreen titles. And that's, I think, the reason why we have the largest number of evergreen titles and probably the most proportion of evergreen titles in the industry. And we also -- just to reiterate on James' point, the diversity is actually very important. And so, that's why if you look at the Tencent game family, we actually have probably the most diverse number of studios in the world, and all these studios would actually work in their own way to achieve success in their games. But at the same time, they can actually share experiences, too. So, hopefully, collectively, they can actually progress much faster than the rest of the industry.Wendy Huang Thank you.

Let me now introduce the management team on the webinar tonight. Our chairman and CEO, Pony Ma, will kick-off with a short overview. President Martin Lau and Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell will provide a business review. Chief Financial Officer John Lo will conclude with a financial discussion before we open the floor for questions. I will now pass it to Pony. Pony Ma -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Wendy. Good evening. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. During the first quarter of 2024, several of our leading games in China and internationally started to benefit from team reorganisations we put in place, resulting in an increase in games gross receipts and creating a foundation for our games revenue to resume growth in future quarters. We continue to cultivate high quality revenue streams, including advertising in video accounts and Weixin Search, mini games platform service fees, and e-commerce technology service fees, contributing to our gross and operating profit growth outpacing our revenue growth. Executing on our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders, we stepped up our buyback plan and are on track to repurchase over 100 billion Hong Kong dollars of our shares in 2024, as well as paying an increased dividend, while investing in AI technology, platform enhancements, and high production value content. Looking at our financial numbers for the quarter. Total revenue was 160 billion RMB, up 6% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. Gross profit was 84 billion RMB, up 23% year on year and 8% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS operating profit was 59 billion RMB, up 30% year on year and 19% quarter on quarter. Non-IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 50 billion RMB, up 54% year on year and 18% quarter on quarter. Turning to our key services. For communication and social networks. Combined MAU of Weixin and WeChat grew year on year and quarter on quarter to 1.36 billion. For digital content, which reinforces our leadership in long-form video and music streaming, as Tencent Video and TME subscriptions grew year on year. For games, we made proactive adjustments driving initial recovery for our flagship games in China and international markets while several games in our portfolio achieved record highs in gross receipts during the quarter. For cloud, international and domestic clients from media, entertainment, and live streaming industries increasingly use Tencent Cloud media services. Our enterprise SaaS products, WeCom and Tencent Meeting, [Inaudible] functionalities and increase their adoption by enterprise customers. I will now hand over to Martin for a business review.Martin Lau -- President Thank you, Pony. Good evening, and good morning to everybody. For the first quarter of 2024, our total revenue was up 6% year on year. VAS represented 49% of our total revenue, within which social networks subsegment was 19%, domestic games segment was 22% ,and international games was 8%. Online advertising was 17% of total revenue, and fintech and business services was 33% of total revenue. Our overall gross profit growth, which we consider as a key proxy for our organic growth, was 23% year on year in the first quarter, faster than first half of 2021 when our revenue growth rates were much higher. This was driven by the rapid growth of high-margin revenue streams, including video accounts and Weixin Search advertising, wealth management services, mini games, platform service fees, and e-commerce technology service fees. Improved cost efficiency in our long-form video and cloud businesses also contributed to higher gross profit. By segment, VAS gross profit increased 5% year on year to 45 billion RMB, representing 54% of our total gross profit. Online advertising gross profit increased 66% year on year to 15 billion RMB, contributing 17% of total gross profit. And fintech and business services gross profit increased 42% year on year to 24 billion RMB, contributing 28% of total gross profit. For value-added services, segment revenue was 79 billion RMB, down 1% year on year. Social networks revenue was down 2% year on year to 31 billion RMB. Revenue from music subscriptions, video accounts live streaming, mini games, and video subscriptions increased while revenue from music and games related to live streaming services declined sharply. Long-form video subscription revenue increased 12% year on year. Average daily video subscriptions increased 8% year on year to 116 million benefiting from popular self-commission to drama series and animated series, such as Blossoms Shanghai, The Hunter, and Perfect World Season 4. Music subscription revenue increased 39% year on year, reflecting growth in subscriptions and ARPU. TME strengthened collaboration with Tencent Video and released original sound track of the popular drama series, The Legend of Shen Li. Domestic games revenue was down 2% year on year to 35 billion RMB. Increased revenue from VALORANT, Fight of the Golden Spatula, and Lost Ark was offset by decreased revenue from Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite. As Honour of Kings faced a tough comparison against Chinese New Year of 2023 and Peacekeeper Elite to revenue in the first -- in the quarter reflected weak monetisable content releases in recent quarters. However, total gross receipts of domestic games in the first quarter increased 3% year on year, showing a general recovery trend. International games revenue increased 3% year on year to 14 billion RMB or stable in constant-currency terms. On the other hand, gross receipts increased by 34% year on year, driven by PUBG Mobile and Supercell's games contributions. The growth rate of revenue lagged behind gross receipts due to long deferral periods for Supercell's games. Moving on to communications and social networks. For Weixin, users are increasingly supplementing their stable consumption of social graph supply content in chat and Moments with consumption of algorithmically recommended content in official accounts and video accounts and engagement with Mini Programs' diverse range of services. This trend benefits from our heavy investment in AI, which makes the recommendation better and better over time. For official accounts, which enable creators to share text and images on chosen topics with interested followers, it achieved healthy year-on-year page view growth as AI-powered recommendation algorithms allow us to provide targeted high-quality content more effectively. Mini programs have become an increasingly powerful platform for merchants and content providers to engage users online and offline. Total user time spent on mini programs grew over 20% year on year in the first quarter. Among non-game use cases, daily activations increased at double-digit rate year on year, particularly in the productivity tools, dining services, and transportation. For Mini Games, gross receipts increased 30% year on year with notable growth from new releases as well as games released for over three years. Video accounts user time spent grew 80% year on year in the first quarter. Time spent on video accounts is now over two times that of Moments. We also strengthened our live streaming e-commerce ecosystem by diversifying merchandise categories and enabling more content creators to monetize to e-commerce activities. Now, with that, I'll pass to James.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Thank you, Martin. Moving on to domestic games with our two flagship games, we highlighted last-quarter proactive adjustments we made, including spreading out the timing of high-value virtual item sales through the year and enhancing content design. While their revenues declined in the first quarter, we can see these adjustments are starting to yield results with gross receipts for each of Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite increasing year on year in March. Several of our other games achieved notable milestones during the first quarter. Fight of the Golden Spatula delivered record DAU and ranked third by gross receipts across all mobile games in China during the quarter, driven by popular content updates, including new Chibi Champions and a customizable arena. CrossFire Mobile achieved all-time highs in paying users and gross receipts this quarter, benefiting from new PBE content and an enhanced rewards system. And Arena Breakout achieved new milestones in DAU, paying users, and gross receipts as we released an enlarged map with vehicles and introduced armor and weapons inspired by ancient Chinese culture. We aim to release several high-production value games this year including DnF Mobile next week, Tarisland, Need for Speed Mobile, One Piece Mobile, and Delta Force: Hawk Operations. Among our international games, PUBG Mobile increased DAU and gross receipts by double-digit percentage rates year on year in the first quarter, benefiting from popular new modes and featured events such as the Shadow Force Mode and Golden Moon Event. Notably, PUBG Mobile is evolving from a game product into a game platform with increasing user time spent on new modes beyond the original Battle Royale, notably the extraction shooter mode Metro Royale. Brawl Stars' average DAU more than doubled year on year, and gross receipts more than quadrupled year on year in the first quarter. The game ranked the third highest mobile game by DAU globally ex China in March. Supercell expanded Brawl Star's development team, enabling the creation of a new five-versus-five mode, a simplified reward system, and successful community events. Warframe achieved record-high gross receipts in the first quarter with the introduction of a new faster-moving war frame, the Gauss Prime. For online advertising, our revenue was 26.5 billion renminbi in the quarter, up 26% year on year, benefiting from increased engagements in AI-powered ad targeting. Outspend from all major categories, except automotive, increased year on year, particularly from games, internet services, and consumer goods sectors. During the quarter, we upgraded our ad tech platform to help advertisers manage ad campaigns more effectively, and we made generative AI-powered ad creation tools available to all advertisers. These initiatives enable advertisers to create ads more efficiently and to deliver better targeting. For Weixin, video account ad revenue grew over 100% year on year due to higher video views and click-through rates. Mini Programs ad revenue grew over 40% year on year, benefiting among other features from mini games closed-loop effect, whereby mini game developers both boost demand, being substantial advertisers themselves, but also creates supply as the mini games provide high CPM rewarded video ad inventory. On content platforms, our long-form video ad revenue increased at a double-digit rate year on year as popular self-commissioned drama series attracted marketing budgets. Looking at fintech and business services, segment revenue was 52 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year. Fintech services revenues slowed to a single-digit year-on-year growth rate. For payments, commercial payment growth moderated due to slow off-line consumption spending with draw fee revenue decreased year on year as consumers are increasingly funding commercial transactions with their Weixin cash balances and placing these cash balances in money market funds rather than withdrawing the cash balances to bank accounts, which triggers the withdraw fee revenue. For wealth management, revenue grew robustly year on year with rapid increases in the number of users and average fund investments per user, primarily invested in low-risk money market funds. Turning to business services, revenue grew at a teens rate year on year in the first quarter, benefiting from higher cloud services revenue and increased technology service fee contribution due to rising video accounts e-commerce transactions. Business services gross profit more than doubled year on year due to increased contributions from higher-margin revenue streams plus improved efficiency. Domestic and international clients, especially from the media entertainment and live streaming industries, are increasingly adopting our integrated audio and video cloud solution for Tencent Cloud Media Services, which achieved over 50% year-on-year revenue growth. IDC recognized Tencent Cloud Media Services as the market leader in its sector for the sixth consecutive year. Among our enterprise SaaS products in WeCom, merchants are increasingly willing to pay for use of customer communication functionality. As a result, WeCom revenue tripled year on year. For Tencent Meeting, we're driving adoption and upselling among enterprise clients, and Tencent Meeting revenue doubled year on year. And for Hunyuan, the main model achieved significant progress as we've scaled up using a mixture of experts approach, and we're deploying Hunyuan in more of our services. Today, we announced that we're making a version of Hunyuan providing text-to-image generative AI available on an open source basis. And with that, I'll pass to John.John Lo -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, James. Hi, everybody. For the first quarter of 2024, total revenue was 159.5 billion renminbi, up 6% year on year. Gross profit was 83.9 billion renminbi, up 23% year on year. Operating profit was 32.6 billion renminbi, up 38% year on year. Interest income was 4.2 billion renminbi, up 43% year on year, driven by growth in cash reserves and high interest yield. Finance costs were 2.8 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year, due to higher interest expenses. Share of profit of associates and JVs was 2.2 billion renminbi, up from profit of 0.1 billion renminbi in the same period last year. On a non-IFRS basis, share of profit was 5.5 billion renminbi versus loss of 0.1 billion renminbi last year, driven by better profitability at certain domestic associates and reduced losses at certain overseas associates. Income tax expense rose by 24% year on year to 14.1 billion renminbi, primarily driven by operating profit growth and higher provision for withholding tax. IFRS net profit attributable to equity holders was 41.9 billion renminbi, up 62% year on year. Diluted EPS was 4.386 renminbi, up 66% year on year. On non-IFRS financial figures, operating profit was 58.6 billion renminbi, up 30% year on year. Net profit attributable to equity holders was 50.3 billion renminbi, up 34% year on year. The difference in year-on-year growth rates between operating profit and net profit was mainly due to non-IFRS share of profit from associates and JVs, which amounted to 5.5 billion renminbi this quarter, compared to loss -- share of loss of 0.1 billion renminbi in the same quarter last year. Diluted EPS was 5.263 renminbi, up 57% year on year, outpacing non-IFRS net profit growth, mainly due to reduced share count from share buybacks. For the first quarter of 2024, our weighted average number of shares for calculating diluted EPS decreased by 1.8% year on year. Moving on to gross margins. Overall gross margin was 53%, up 7 percentage points year on year. By segment, VAS gross margin was 57%, up 3 percentage points year on year. This was due to growth in subscription revenues and increase in high-margin mini game platform service fees and certain content cost and operating cost savings. Online advertising gross margin increased to 55%, up 13 percentage points year on year, primarily driven by growth in our video accounts and Weixin Search advertising revenues. Fintech and business services gross margin increased to 46%, up 11 percentage points year on year. This was driven by higher contribution from high-margin wealth management services revenue and e-commerce technology service fee, improved monetization of WeCom and other business services, and increased cost efficiency in our cloud businesses. On first-quarter operating expenses, selling and marketing expenses were 7.5 billion renminbi, up 7% year on year, driven by increased spending on promotion and advertising for new content release. The total represented 5% of revenues, stable year on year. R&D expenses were 15.7 billion renminbi, up 3% year on year. G&A expenses, excluding R&D, were 9.1 billion renminbi, down 3% year on year due to lower staff costs, including share-based compensation expenses and reduced operating lease and office expenses. At quarter-end, we had approximately 105,000 employees, down 1% both year on year and quarter on quarter. Let's look at our first-quarter non-IFRS margin ratios. So, non-IFRS operating margin was 37%, up 7 percentage points year on year. Non-IFRS net margin was 32%, up 10 percentage points year on year. To conclude, I will highlight some key cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating capex was 6.6 billion renminbi, up 557% year on year from a low base quarter last year, mainly driven by investment in GPUs and servers to support our Hunyuan and AI app recommendation algorithms. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, operating capex was down 1%. Nonoperating capex was 7.8 billion renminbi, up 127% year on year due to acquisition of land use rights during the quarter. As a result, total capex was 14.4 billion renminbi, up 226% year on year. Free cash flow was 51.9 billion renminbi, largely stable year on year or up 52% quarter on quarter, primarily due to higher gross receipts from games. Net cash position was 92.5 billion renminbi, up 69% year on year, reflecting strong free cash generation, partially offset by 13.5 billion cash out for share repurchase during the quarter. Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, John. We shall now open the floor for questions. [Operator instructions] We will take one main question, up to one follow-up question each time. The first question comes from Kenneth Fong from UBS.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on online game. Last quarter, we highlighted one of our key strategy is to rejuvenate our key titles. That is showcasing the robust performance on the Supercell game, the recovery of PUBG. Given our rich IP portfolio and strong experience in executing online game, can management share with us how to think about the potential and growth plan ahead and how we can replicate the success to our other IPs and titles? And I have a follow-up question on the buyback side. Last quarter, we have completed at least 100 billion of buyback last quarter. Given our share price have -- has been going up very meaningfully since last quarter, how should we think about the pace of the buyback? Would it be more share-price dependent or any other factors that we should consider? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Kenneth. Thank you for the question. Perhaps I'll take the one on games and Martin on buybacks. So, for games, as you observed, we have been in the process of rejuvenating some of our key games. And we believe that process is well underway now. We are confident in the progress of that process. And there's a couple of learnings that we derive from our experience along this journey. One is that -- what we classify as evergreen games truly do appear to be capable of growing new shoots and, indeed, rejuvenating themselves as evergreen trees should. And a good example would be Brawl Stars, where we cited, not only the quadrupling of gross receipts, but also the doubling -- more than doubling of daily active users. A second learning is that in the event that, again, which we believe should be an evergreen title is stagnating, then the problem is usually not with the nature of the game. It's with the nature of the team running the game. And we need to make changes to the team, and sometimes, the changes are changing mindsets, sometimes the change is a change in people. And what we find is that when we make those changes, then we see positive results flow quite quickly. And if we don't see the positive results slow, then we make further changes. But the games themselves, these big competitive multiplayer games are inherently evergreen just as key sports, such as football, basketball, are inherently evergreen. And with the right people running the games, then we get the right results.Martin Lau -- President In terms of the buyback, we have committed to buying back at least 100 billion Hong Kong dollars of our stock as we announced last time. And since then, the buyback has been done on a pretty consistent basis. At this point in time, I don't think the buyback is share-price dependent because it is true that the share price has come up quite a bit. But if you look at the share price when it was announced, it was pretty incredible. And so, even today, without the share price, it's still attractive, given the fact that our profit has increased quite substantially, given the fact that the value of our investment portfolio has been increasing, and also given the fact that our long-term prospect is actually very good. So, that's why we'll continue to pursue our share buyback at this point in time.Kenneth Fong -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you, and congrats on the very strong set of results.Martin Lau -- President Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, Kenneth. Next, we will move to Thomas Chong from Jefferies.Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Good evening. Thanks, management, for taking my question. And congratulations on a strong set of result. My first question is about our advertising business. We see a very good set of momentum in the first quarter. How should we think about our market share gain story and the as tech upgrade on the back of macro recovery? How are we actually seeing the ad sentiment as we come to June 18th? And on video accounts, how should we ambition the advertising growth momentum over the next few years and the strength of live streaming e-commerce GMV growth to drive our ad revenue? And my second question is about our high-quality growth strategy. Given our high-quality growth strategy standout and our strong earnings growth momentum, how should we expect our earnings growth and margin trend over the next few years? Should we expect there might be some point that we need to go back to have more reinvestment? And in terms of opex, how should we think about S&M expenses over the next few quarters, given that we have more content and new game releases? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Thomas. So, on your first question around advertising, I'd say that, as you would expect, given the economy is mixed, advertiser sentiment is also quite mixed. And it's certainly a challenging environment in which to set advertising. The first quarter for us is a slightly unusual quarter because it's a small quarter for advertising due to the Chinese New Year effect. And so, sometimes the accelerations or the decelerations get magnified as a result. So, we would expect our advertising growth to be less rapid in subsequent quarters of the year than it was in the first quarter and more similar to consensus expectations for our advertising revenue growth for the rest of the year. But that said, we think that we are in a good position to continue taking share of the market at a rapid rate, given we're very early in increasing our ad load on video accounts, which is currently around one-quarter of the outloads of our major competitors with short video products. And also given we're early in capturing the benefits of deploying AI to our ad tech stack -- and we think that we will -- we are benefiting and will continue to benefit disproportionately from applying AI to our ad tech because historically, as a social media platform, our click-through rates were low. And so, starting from that lower base, we can -- we have seen we can double or triple click-through rates in a way that's not possible for ad services that are starting from much higher click-through rates. So, overall, we remain quite constructive on our ability to grow our advertising revenue at a decent rate, and we believe we'll also continue to take market share irrespective of the overall advertising market conditions. Thank you. Martin Lau -- President In terms of the high-quality growth strategy, I do want to clarify that we have always been pursuing a strategy and philosophy of investing in the platform and investing in our user experience and products and monetize on a gradual basis. So, the fact that we can now unleash a lot of these growth drivers is not because we are milking our platform or harvesting our platform. It's because of the fact that we have always been investing in our platform, and this is a continuous action. So, I think that's actually very important. The reason the high-quality growth driver has become clearer is because we have -- we have actually pruned our business of the lower-quality products and services and the distractions, if you will, in our businesses so that we can actually focus on our core platforms and, at the same time, make the growth drivers more obvious and apparent. And we do believe that these growth drivers, be it video accounts advertising or Weixin Search advertising or value-added services on top of our payment platform and, over time, the e-commerce service fees, these -- sort of a pretty long runway going forward. And we have always also been investing in new areas that can serve as growth drivers for the future, including AIs, including new games, including Weixin e-commerce, and SaaS products, just to name a few. So, we felt, over time, our gross margin should actually continue to benefit from the continued increase of these high-quality revenues. And that has a pretty long runway. Now, in terms of sales and marketing, I'll pass to John to answer that question.John Lo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, this -- well, to recap, the selling and marketing expenses grew by 17% year on year. And we expect that the year-on-year growth will be at a lower rate, somewhere from low to mid teens in 2024. Having said that, promotion advertising expense is something that we can adjust up and down dynamically according to our needs. And if we can -- if we identify some services or products that we need to invest, we will definitely do it. But with the cost optimization, culture, and mechanism in mind, we will definitely assess the ROI rigorously.Wendy Huang Thank you. Next, we will take the question from Alicia Yap from Citigroup.Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst Hi. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the solid quarter. Two questions. First is on the gaming. So, with the positive growth in the grossing of HoK, Peacekeeper, and also several games also achieving record-high growth in receipts this quarter -- so, the strong growth in the deferred should also work well for the upcoming revenue growth in the coming quarters. Is there any outstanding adjustment that is still ongoing? Or are there any risk or uncertainty on the gaming business that we need to be concerned or worry about? And second question is -- wondering if there's any chance the games, application, or the digital content application by Tencent or other developers in China could see an improvement in the app store revenue sharing arrangement in the coming quarter that might support further uptake in the gross margin for the VAS. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Alicia. Thank you for your questions and for the congratulations. So, on the first question around the games, then -- yes, the deferred revenue growth is a positive leading indicator for game reported revenue growth. No, we don't see particular risks to call out. We believe, with the structural changes we have made, we have somewhat derisked the game business. And therefore, looking forward, our focus will be on execution of the new strategy for the existing games and successfully launching the several major new games we've identified in our pipeline. In terms of your second question around app store revenue sharing ratios, then we do believe that app stores are currently over-earning at the expense of app providers, including ourselves, both in China and even more so internationally. But for the purposes of our business plan, we assume that those revenue-sharing arrangements remain as they are today. Thank you.Wendy Huang Thank you, Alicia. We will take the next question from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley. Gary, your line is open.Gary Yu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you, management, for taking my question. And congratulations on a solid set of results. I have a follow-up questions on the game business, and thank you for the earlier comment regarding what we learned from the evergreen games. On the same note, what have we learned in terms of whenever we see potential new games launched? What's the management strategy to try to kind of cultivate the games into our next evergreen game, I think, particularly on the domestic side, we have DnF Mobile coming up. And then on the international side, we may have more games coming up. So, how should we look at the strategy for new games launched going forward? And my second question is also a follow-up question on margin upside. Across these business segments, how should we look at the sustainable kind of margin level going forward, given it seems like the margin upside is across the border cross business segments? So, how should we look at the kind of relative margin trend going forward for different segments? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Yes. So, on your question about new games, the game industry is a challenging industry for new games because as the evergreen games become better and better, then every new game is competing, not only against other new games released around the same time, but also against every existing game or the best of all the existing games that have survived and evolved to become evergreen games. And that's true on PC, it's true on mobile, it's true on console, it's true in China, it's increasingly true internationally as well, where you can see the time spent on the big consoles is more and more centered around the gigantic evergreen games like Fortnite, like Call of Duty. And so, our response to that is to continually raise the bar on the new games we actually bring to market and focus on fewer but bigger and better new games. And not every new game we bring to market has a high probability of becoming evergreen. There are some new games we will bring to market which are more consciously content-driven games, which will have a cycle associated with them. And that's fine. They can still be successful profitable games that players enjoy and love. But for those games that we do aspire to the status of evergreen games, then the metrics we focus on are not the metrics that you may find most visible externally, such as the hype, the excitement, the downloads, the first-day revenues. Rather, we look at metrics of their engagement, such as the retention rates. And it is those leading indicators that tell us when a game is a new game that has a moderate launch and will fade away after a year or two versus when there's a new game that also has a moderate launch but goes from strength to strength, which is what we've seen with Fight of the Golden Spatula. As you mentioned, despite a fairly secured start, it's now the third-biggest mobile game in China behind two of our other games. So, those are some of the thoughts we have and policies we have around new game launches.Martin Lau -- President Gary, on your question around the sustainability of margins for each segment, it's really a number of factors are at play, including competitive conditions, macroeconomic conditions, seasonality. But I think the most important factor over the longer term is the mix of products and businesses within that segment. And so, you can see that for all three of our big segments, but particularly for advertising and fintech and business services, there's been positive mix shifts underway, away from lower-margin revenue streams and toward higher-margin revenue streams. And as Martin articulated, we see those positive mix shifts continuing for years to come for all three of our segments. And therefore, we believe that both the margins where they are and also the upward margin trends are sustainable.Wendy Huang Thank you, Gary. We will take the next question from Ana [Inaudible] from [Inaudible] Securities.Unknown speaker Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. My name is Ana [Inaudible] from [Inaudible], and it's actually my first time to ask a question. So, the first question I want to ask management is we saw Meta improve their Advantage+ advertising tool based on the large language models. And we wonder if management can share more on how Tencent plans to use AI to improve the ad business. And also, in the future, do you think like under the AI developments like our competitors such as Baidu [Inaudible] or Alibaba, they also apply AI to their ad business. So, how do you think that AI will drive to add market share to change in the longer term? So, this is my first question. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Great. Welcome to joining our Q&A, Ana. I'll take the first question, although it might be a supplement. But we believe that tools like Advantage+ is extremely important in terms of helping social media companies, whether it's Meta or ourselves, grow into being all that they can be on the advertising front because they simplify and automate the advertising, buying and advertising targeting processes, so that the social media companies can deliver experiences to advertisers that are more competitive with those that had already been delivered by search engines and by e-commerce platforms but with the advantage that the social media platforms have much greater time spent user engagements than search engines or e-commerce platforms. And so, to the second part of your question around a number of competitors are obviously applying AI as well, and we believe that all of them will benefit from AI, too. But we think that the biggest beneficiaries will be those companies, of which we are one, that have very substantial under-monetized time spent and now able to monetize that time spend more effectively by deploying AI because the deployment of AI enables an upward structural shift in click-through rates. And that shift is most pronounced for those inventories where the click-through rates were lower to begin with, such as the social media inventory. Those tools also allow advertisers who previously were able to create advertisements for search, which are text in nature but not to create advertisements for social media, which are image and video in nature, to now use generative AI to create advertisements in social media. So, in general, we think there'll be a reallocation of advertising spend toward those services, which have high time spent, high engagement, and are now able to deliver increasing click-through rates, increasing transaction volume more commensurate with the time spent and engagement superiority. Thank you.Unknown speaker Thank you so much. I do have a follow-up question toward -- recently, I noticed, actually Meta, they announced their -- the Meta AI function and the rollout to automated products such as WhatsApp and like Facebook, Messenger, etc. And do you think that in the future of Tencent, because we have such a great network product environment, will we have a similar product like Meta AI?Martin Lau -- President Well, I think we do believe that with the right product than our WeChat platform and our other products, which have a lot of user engagement, would be great -- will be great distribution channels for these AI products. But I think at this point in time, everybody is actually trying out different products that may work. No one has really come up with a killer application yet with the exception of probably OpenAI [Inaudible]. So, I think you should be confident that we have been developing the technology, and we are having a best-in-class technology in Hunyuan. And at the same time, we are actively creating and testing out different products to see what would make sense for our existing products. And as the time comes, these products will be rolled out on our platform.Unknown speaker Thank you so much. I'm sorry. Can I just have one more additional question because we're really excited for Tencent. And recently --Wendy Huang I'm sorry. In the interest of time, we need to save the time -- only two for each analyst.Unknown speaker OK. Thank you. All right. OK.Wendy Huang Thank you. So, we will take the next question from John Choi from Daiwa.John Choi -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst Hey. Well, thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on a great set of results. I have a question about your business services on cloud. I realized that some of your new business at WeCom, revenue tripled. Tencent Meeting also doubled. Are we seeing more of an acceleration trend in terms of our adapting our services? And in terms of -- given that cloud business is also very sensitive to macro conditions, are your customers now opening up or more warmed up on using our services as a result? Hopefully, we should see this kind of accelerated toward the remaining part of the year. And I have a quick follow-up question on your wealth management. I think this has been one of the key drivers of your growth on fintech services. Can you kind of elaborate a bit more about our strategy here, what we -- where we need to invest? And what kind of further areas in terms of margins where you could benefit from this part of the business, but also what kind of investments that is required to further cultivate further development here? Thank you.Martin Lau -- President In terms of SaaS, I think what we have seen is our initial success in monetizing these products, which we have been offering as a free service for a long time. And that's actually off a relatively low base. So, I think we look at it more as validation -- an early validation of the fact that we can get paid for some SaaS services in China. So, we really started from a base case of enterprises are not paying for software, which is very different from established markets like the U.S. And we're starting to monetize some value-added services offered to enterprises. But I think this is still early stage. This is still not a big amount of money that we're talking about, compared to what enterprise software have been able to achieve in the U.S. And I think it will continue to be a very long way for us to grow such revenue. So, I don't think it's an acceleration of monetization. It's more of a validation of the initial case. And from that point on, we would grow it consistently, but we haven't really reached the inflection point yet. But we'll continue to invest in these SaaS services because we felt this is a great service in itself. It's actually providing great connection for us with the enterprise customers, which we can cross-sell other of our cloud and enterprise services. And at the same time, we felt at some point in time, maybe in not the very near future, that inflection point will come, and we want to be the most competitive and leading player at the time when the inflection point comes. Now, in terms of the wealth management service, mainly our customers putting their money into money market funds in which we offered alongside with fund management companies. And so, instead of our customers withdrawing the money into their bank accounts or spending the money, they actually put these money in money market funds. And we have seen an increasing trend around that partly because of the fact that there are many more use cases within our payment platform so that people are getting used to putting more money within the platform and partly because there is reduced willingness for consumers to spend. So, they actually save more rather than spend more. And I think on this front, what we want to do is continue to build up our payment platform so that people are comfortable in entrusting us with more of their wealth, and they can have more use cases so that they can use it for different purposes. That would increase the propensity for people to park the money with us. And we'll continue to work with more fund management companies so that they can offer good money market as well as other wealth management products and services to our customers. But at the same time, we also want to make sure that we invest heavily in risk management so that we really have a very close look and watch over the safety of the wealth for our customers. So, all these things are being pursued at the same time. So, if we can do all these, we believe this service will continue to grow on a consistent basis.Wendy Huang We will take the next question from Charlene Liu from HSBC. Charlene, your line is open. Charlene, can you hear us? OK, maybe we will move to the next question, to Ronald Keung from Goldman Sachs.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you Wendy, and thank you Pony, Martin, James, and John for the sharing. I have two questions. One is I asked about the video accounts and mini program last year on e-commerce, so I want to hear, where do we see we are innovating most in terms of ad tech? We've read about -- you've talked about ad tech upgrades, so will we leverage video accounts, live streaming, and mini program, maybe on an ROI-based ad products? Then I have a follow-up question.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Ronald. On ad tech, we're innovating around the process of targeting the ads using artificial intelligence. We're innovating around helping advertisers manage their advertising campaigns, and then most recently we have been -- we are now deploying Hunyuan to facilitate advertisers creating their advertising content, so those are three areas where we're driving innovation that are contributing to the rapid revenue growth you're seeing for our advertising business.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. And then my follow-up question is on our investment portfolio. Given it's very sizable, nearly $130 billion in value, do we have any thinking on consistent or any distribution policies after the JV and Meituan distributions in the past? I'm thinking about any predictable policies so that the market will more actively value this part of the value, given the substantial market value within Tencent. Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer On that front, we have been working with some of our investee companies, and many of them have been working unprompted by themselves to enhance their profitability, and so if you look at the non-IFRS associate income that we reported this quarter of a little over 5 billion renminbi, that's up very sharply year on year, and it annualizes to a number in the 20s of billions renminbi. To the extent that investors are valuing Tencent's overall earnings at a certain multiple, then implicitly, they're now valuing our investment portfolio at several hundred billion renminbi. There is still a gap between that implicit valuation through our multiple and the associate income contributing to our multiple of several hundred billion renminbi versus the intrinsic value or the market value of the portfolio, which is substantially higher, but as the associates -- as companies like Pinduoduo become steadily more profitable, then more and more that gap will narrow itself as the profitability of the associates gets directly reflected in our own net income.Martin Lau -- President At this point in time, we don't really have a plan to distribute any stock for now. As a matter of fact, you can see in the past few years, we have been investing most of our cash flow into our investment portfolio, And that's at a time when the market was seeing very fast growth and there were new companies being formed and grew to very large size. And as a result, we actually benefited a lot from investing in these companies. At the same time, the investment also helped us a lot in terms of building ecosystems on our core platform. So, if you look at, for example games, we have been able to invest in a lot of game studios, which helped us to get access to international markets as well as get a hold of a lot of evergreen and large titles. In the music industry, for example, we have invested in Spotify and also upstream in order for us to establish a very strong position for TME in China. On the payment side, we have actually invested in companies which actually contributed to a lot of use cases. Both strategically and financially, the investment portfolio has actually generated a lot of return for the shareholders, but now it has reached a very big size and some of the companies, as it matures, we actually distribute. And now, given the size of the portfolio, we don't actually envision we're going to have to put additional money into it. If we need to pursue new initiatives, we can actually recycle some of the investments within the portfolio, so the contribution to the shareholder value is that the free cash flow of the company can actually be used for shareholder enhancing activities, such as dividend paying and share buyback. That's the way we think about it. Thanks.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, Martin.Wendy Huang Thank you, Ronald. We have successfully reconnected with Charlene Liu from HSBC. Charlene, your line is open.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Thank you so much, Wendy. Really appreciate the opportunity. I have two questions. I think first is about the application of Hunyuan, management has --Martin Lau -- President We can't hear. Can you repeat that question?Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Yes. Can you hear me OK? Yeah. So, management has spoken quite extensively on how Hunyuan can benefit the ad business. Can we talk about application of AI onto the game business, and how does management expect --Martin Lau -- President We can't hear her. Sorry, we can't hear her.Wendy Huang Sorry. Charlene, your line is not stable. Maybe we will catch up offline.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Is it better? Sorry. Is it better?Martin Lau -- President Yeah. One more try, maybe.Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst OK, sorry. Thank you so much, really appreciate this. Can we talk about Hunyuan's potential application on the game business, and how does management expect that to play a larger role to help in game production? It doesn't -- OK, sorry. Thank you for the opportunity.Martin Lau -- President I think for Hunyuan, the --Charlene Liu -- HSBC -- Analyst Game production --Martin Lau -- President It can be assisting game business in multiple ways. Right now, the best contributor is actually on the customer service front. When Hunyuan is actually deployed to answer questions and be a customer service bot for a lot of our games, it's actually achieving very high customer satisfaction level. And AI in general has already been deployed in our games but not necessarily the generative-AI technology yet. In terms of Hunyuan, I think over time, when we actually can move Hunyuan into a multi-model, and especially if we can start creating really high quality, high fidelity videos, then that would actually be helpful. Before that happens, then Hunyuan can actually be used in NPCs and create certain interactive experiences, but it's not going to be able to take over the very heavy growth of content creation in gaming yet. I think it probably will be a couple more generations before it can be deployed for gaming production.Wendy Huang Thank you, Charlene. We will follow up with you on your other questions. So, next, we will move to Alex Yao from JPMorgan.Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thank you, management team, for taking our question, and congrats on a strong quarter. I have two questions. Number one is on the fintech business. Can you elaborate the slowdown of the fintech business, perhaps decompose the business into payment and non-payment? And also, how should we think about the medium term growth outlook for the fintech business as a whole? The second question is on the Weixin Search, which seems to be picking up monetization momentum in recent quarters. Can you discuss strategy to monetize Weixin Search activities? It would be great if you could share with us some of the operating metrics, just to help us understand the length of the runway. Thank you.Martin Lau -- President In terms of fintech, I think most of the reason for the slowdown is actually the headwind on offline consumption. We felt this is a phenomenon which you probably see across many other industries as well. We felt -- as a whole, the government is actually putting in a lot of stimulus to revive the economy, to revive consumption confidence, and at some point in time we believe this headwind will actually turn. But before it turns, then I think our fintech revenue on the payment side, which forms the bulk of the revenue of fintech, would actually be slow in terms of its growth. And on the other hand, in terms of the withdrawal fee, I would say this is anyway a low quality revenue. The withdrawal fee is essentially people pulling money out of the system, and that will be one-time revenue, but then the money actually leaves the system. When people withdraw less, then the money would actually stay within our system for longer. It will not generate an immediate revenue upon withdrawal, but it will be turned into an asset under management and would continue to generate wealth management fees over time. So, that actually turns into a longer term high value-added revenue. In terms of wealth management services, I think it will continue to grow for the reasons that I talked about earlier. For loan generation fees, I think we are getting a little bit more cautious as there is a macro headwind, and we want to be very vigilant on risk management. So, that's how we look at the different components of the fintech revenue. And what was the other question?Alex Yao -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Weixin Search.Martin Lau -- President In terms of Weixin Search, I think it's a service which has been growing in terms of the usage and in terms of the search volume on a very healthy rate, so the service itself is growing. And we have been monetizing that service on a relatively light basis. In fact, it just started last year that we started monetizing Weixin Search. So, with the combination of the fact that there is a very large engagement with Weixin and the fact that Weixin Search itself is actually growing in volume and that there is an expanding content ecosystem within Weixin, be it official accounts, be it mini programs, be it video accounts, and we're relatively early in the monetization cycle, all these factors will contribute to a pretty long runway in terms of our continued growth of the search revenue on Weixin.Wendy Huang Thank you. In the interests of time, we will take the last question from Robin Zhu from Bernstein. Robin, your line is open.Robin Zhu -- Bernstein -- Analyst Thank you. Hi, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just two, please. One, James, I think at one point, you said that you think video accounts monetization could be as big as Moments. Now that video accounts engagement is 2x of Moments, could I get your thoughts on the intensity of ad revenue per engagement? And is there any reason why the two couldn't equalize, meaning that actually total monetization of video accounts ends up being much larger than Moments compared to what you said, I think, a year or two ago now? Then secondly on games. I think different members of management have been critical about the internal game development process, and just wanted to get your thoughts on we have a pretty full pipeline, it looks like, for the rest of the year, does that mean -- or in your mind, do you think that the issues over the last few years have now resolved and we should look forward to a more consistent launch pipeline in the second half and in future years? Thank you.James Mitchell -- Chief Strategy Officer Hi, Robin. Thank you for your question. On the first one, yes, I think objectively, you can see from the results of companies like Meta that operate both traditional feel and also a short video feed, that over time that the monetization for short video feed converges with or overtakes the monetization of the traditional social feed. And we feel that's the trajectory we're on as well. With regards to the second question, we do feel we've debugged some of the more obvious challenges. No doubt there's other challenges we haven't identified or other challenges that would arise in the future. And so, it is an iterative debugging process that will never stop. But we feel we've gone -- we've resolved the big immediate challenges, and that is translating into both better engagement and monetization trends with our existing games and also to greater confidence in our pipeline of new games. You made a reference to our internal game development process. And I think that it's easy for outsiders looking at Tencent to assume that there is one game development process, there is one game publishing process, there is one game operating mindset, and so forth. And I can understand why that belief exists. But in reality, it's a little bit like looking at Disney and assuming that the Disney animation studio, the Pixar studio, the 20th Century Fox studio all operate in a homogenous way, which is not the case. If you look at Tencent's five biggest games, one of them is created by a team in Chungdu, one of them is created by a team in Shenzhen, one of them is created by a team in Helsinki, two of them are created by teams in Los Angeles. It's a truly global business, globally distributed, globally different practices. And so, there is no single unified internal game development process. Of course, we try to share best practices and learnings between the big development studios that have created these enormous -- these successful games. But equally, each of those studios that I talked about, each in a different part of the country or the world, still has its own unique attributes, and that's part of their strength. And those strengths, we aim to reinforce over time. That's what I'd say on the game process debugging side.Martin Lau -- President Yes. I just want to add, you actually used the word critical on the game teams. I don't think that's really true. I think there are a lot of things our game teams have done right, but there's just no perfect team, so no perfect games. And we are continuously going through the process of debugging, and we are more transparent and honest on those efforts with the outside world. So, that's the reason why we discuss about what are the changes that we have done to our game teams or to our games. And we also believe some of the major titles that we have are really evergreen titles, such that we don't necessarily blame it on the life cycle of a game when it doesn't work but rather look at what exactly are the bugs or are the untapped potentials that we can actually sort of make changes, so that we can actually get the games to be really evergreen titles. And that's, I think, the reason why we have the largest number of evergreen titles and probably the most proportion of evergreen titles in the industry. And we also -- just to reiterate on James' point, the diversity is actually very important. And so, that's why if you look at the Tencent game family, we actually have probably the most diverse number of studios in the world, and all these studios would actually work in their own way to achieve success in their games. But at the same time, they can actually share experiences, too. So, hopefully, collectively, they can actually progress much faster than the rest of the industry.Wendy Huang Thank you.

      "Greetings and welcome to the Take-Two fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n",

      "Nicole Shevins--Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\n",
      "\n",
      "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 ended March 31, 2024. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's chairman and chief executive officer; Karl Slatoff, our president; and Lainie Goldstein, our chief financial officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors. I'd also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year over year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. Our press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory; and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series.\n",
      "\n",
      "During fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high-quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the No. 1 basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To date, the title has sold-in over 9 million units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engagement remains high, with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continued to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences, including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go; NBA 2K Mobile; and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top 5 on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday-themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to date, the title has sold-in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23%, respectively, for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms, according to Streamhatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar's premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts, and we're thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K's renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We've already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox's catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film, which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest-rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional, with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series' history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the fall. I'd like to thank our friends Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I'd like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a top 20 grossing game in the U.S. Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play Store. We're pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily playtime to around 60 minutes per user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons' Treasure competition and many other features. We'd like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming top 100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I'm highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry-leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet, and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency. And as we deliver our groundbreaking pipeline over the next several years, we're poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karl Slatoff--President\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future, which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline, which includes approximately 40 titles through fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost reduction program, through which we canceled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success.\n",
      "\n",
      "These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to fiscal 2025. We have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA, and, WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26th. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new ARPG was well-received for its visceral combat, distinct art style, and rich narrative. Private Division, along with Weta Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones: Legends.\n",
      "\n",
      "NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this nonsimulation tactical card battle, players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We're proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including 15 immersive core releases: six of which are sports simulation games; one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lainie Goldstein--Chief Financial Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and are entering fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult, will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are confident that, over time, these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results. We delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series; and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K2, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+.\n",
      "\n",
      "NBA 2K was in line with the prior year, and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concepts' ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost reduction program.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year over year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $42 million, as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million, due to higher external developer advances, cash tax, and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost reduction programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year over year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses. We recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year over year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to fall of calendar 2025 from calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025 as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever, and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC, and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker.\n",
      "\n",
      "We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid-single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year over year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here you are about to own all of Gearbox. Can you talk about how you think about now owning all of Gearbox and some of the opportunities that you'll have with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is, when asked when Gearbox was sold to Embracer, whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. You know, we have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has the ability to bring AAA products to market responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he's a hitmaker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and Tiny Tina was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength.\n",

      "\n",
      "You know, typically, Rollic's games are sort of -- you know, they're hot for a while, and then they move on to something next -- something else. Is this going to be the case for these monetizing games as well or is it -- it planned to have a longer life cycle? Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid-casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hyper-casual approach really was, you know, put it out there, get a bunch of downloads, offer a rather light experience, you know, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted. But, you know, long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content, and Rollic is proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long-lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a couple for me. I guess, first off, on the change to the guidance and the outlook, what is your level of confidence, Strauss, in that calendar '25 launch of GTA VI, and is there any -- anything else more specific you can talk about what's behind that postponement? And then secondly, on the high single-digit mobile growth, I'm curious how much of that is related to any recovery you're seeing broadly in mobile gaming, or is that more specific to the increase in marketing spend and these titles that are outperforming your expectations for this year? Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Colin. Well, we actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga, because we are the market leader, of course, it's driven by the market in which we live.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year, we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot in UA in the fourth quarter. We did, and that's turned out to be productive spending.\n",

      "Matt Coss--Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess between the success you've had with Match Factory and some new launch titles, setting a release date for Star Wars Hunters, and then the incremental marketing behind mobile, it seems like there's definitely more momentum in that business, which is great to see. I guess, when we think about your analytical framework for investing in the marketing behind mobile, what are you targeting from a margin or payback perspective and when should we expect to see this investment turn into profitable flow-through from the mobile side?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I hope, like everyone else, we look at these very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition; what kind of retention you expect, which is to say what kind of churn you get; the spending that you have on average; and therefore, the lifetime value. And the longer a payback period you're willing to accept, of course, the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data, and they can change at any given time. So, I'm not prepared to share sort of, you know, our outside payback period. Suffice it to say, though, that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Coss--Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Great. Thank you. And when would you expect to see, you know, mobile -- this investment that you're making in mobile flip from a cost center to, you know, driving incremental profit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "So, of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking, though, which is, frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I declined to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do, however, tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Karl Slatoff--President\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we absolutely expect growth in NBA, and that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full-game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9, and Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we're going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you look at the recurrent consumer spending, specifically -- when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the charts, it's fantastic. So, we've seen significant growth there. So, again, I think we will have momentum. Just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we're going to continue to see very strong RCS growth.\n",

I have a second question, on NBA, how is NBA's transition challenges in between console generations compared to other annually releasing titles on the market, either from 2K or from, you know, other external competitors?

      "\n",
      "OK. So, that's going back quite some time; and frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 9 game and Gen 8 game, is much broader, and I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two games. And frankly, I can't even remember if we had two completely separate games back then.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in any case, the delta is quite significant this time around, so I would expect that the transition is more -- the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one?\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm just curious if you could explain what's driving that up enthusiasm for the game. And then the second question, on your guidance, curious why you're not providing medium term. You've done that before, and it feels like, here, you have at least better visibility on the primary catalyst driving that growth. And then on '27, tying into that question, wondering where your confidence is that you can grow sequentially off '26.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that sort of primarily the GTA ecosystem driving that growth in '27 or it's a combination of that and other AAA games that you plan to release? Thanks, guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold-in over 200 million units. Every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game.\n",
      "\n",
      "And engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% and Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage of the game, more than 10 years after the initial release. So, I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course, expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of your question, I think you're asking in your second question, you know, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for our top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think, now, we're being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect, relating to your third question, sequential growth on top line, and we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question, is that driven by the GTA ecosystem? The answer is, certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem and, again, given that full-game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming, about which we're highly optimistic.\n",

When you come out of the activity you just went through in terms of reevaluating your pipeline and looking at resource allocation across the organization, what were some of the key learnings on right -- the right mix of content is for you guys to meet your hurdle rate going forward and what were some of the key learnings of how much of the resource allocation decisions are now setting the company up on a multiyear view, or do you think they're going to be a continued refinement as you look to marry resources and the IP pipeline in the years ahead? Thanks so much.\n",

This is a process that we go through -- that we've been going through for at least the last 17 years since I've been here. And -- but what we -- what we're looking for specifically around this, this -- the look that we just took, is that we're looking -- we -- look, we understand in the industry right now that the biggest games are winning, and they're taking more share. And that's obviously a fact that we've noticed and take very seriously.\n",

      "And we're simply looking for the projects that we think have the highest chance for commercial success and for critical success and going through and combing through those and going through our pipeline and then making the tough choices. It's always difficult to cancel any projects. But in this context, it was something that was necessary and really part of our normalized process. So, we can -- we absolutely expect that that will continue in the future.\n",

      "This was a pretty tough look and a pretty big look, so I think most of that is behind us.

That is not off the table for us.\n",

      "James Heaney--Jefferies -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. What have been some of the unlocks on the mobile side of the business? You did call out the better-than-expected results in Zynga's IP business, but just curious if there's anything you could say specifically on the advertising side of the business. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, we have two important businesses within mobile, in-app purchases and advertising, and they're both relevant. We took a hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blend of hybrid-casual business where there are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to in-app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has, and our ability to grow in-app purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hit titles. That's what we're focused on.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Heaney--Jefferies -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",

      "The next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clay Griffin--MoffettNathanson -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm curious if you guys would talk about the broader PC strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that there's just tons and tons of engagement, particularly for GTA on PC. Not all of that gets monetized. I think, in the past, you've described that as, you know, maybe it's a good thing to have that there. You don't necessarily need to monetize all of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are some interesting products out there, Overwolf and the like. And so, maybe I'm just curious what you guys are seeing or thinking about your opportunity to unlock monetization on PC. Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karl Slatoff--President\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we look at the PC platform as we do with any platform, and it all starts with content, first and foremost. And we agree, it's a very powerful platform and we've got some very strong third-party partners, also the ability for us to sell directly to the consumer. So, these are all compelling things for us, and we'll continue to develop and support the PC platform as long as the gamer is there. Wherever the gamer is, that's where we're going to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, I don't really see us looking at the PC monetization any differently than we would on any other platform. It really is more about game-to-game. You know, what works for certain games, what doesn't work for certain games. And the overarching edict that we live by is over-deliver on content and the monetization will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clay Griffin--MoffettNathanson -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Great. Thanks, Karl.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chris Schoell--UBS -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Great. Thank you for taking the questions. We saw Rockstar announce a price increase for GTA+. I recognize it's been several years, but can you help us think through the rationale? And as you look ahead to GTA VI, what are your latest thoughts around the pricing dynamics for the franchise or your portfolio, in general, as these games continue to get larger with more robust experiences? Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and, you know, we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer, that the experience vastly over-delivers in the context of the cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Schoell--UBS -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Great. Thank you.\n",

      "And our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omar Dessouky--Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Sure. I have two questions, one on mobile and then just one again on the sequential growth. So, is there any more color at all you can give us on how you're going to grow sequentially in fiscal '27 after lapping just such a tough comp in fiscal '26 when GTA VI is going to launch? It just seems counterintuitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look back at the last two times Rockstar released a mega title, you know, Red Dead Redemption in fiscal '19, fiscal 20 did not grow; and Grand Theft Auto V in fiscal '14, fiscal 15 was down 30%. I'm just kind of trying to square those couple of things there. You know, will it be Rockstar that continues to drive that sequential growth in fiscal '27? Any more color there would be really great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, that's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and -- certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. This sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full-game GTA Vs for over 10 years, and we continue to sell more in a given year than most other stand-alone releases sell in their first year, even at our big competitors' companies. So, we actually think that there's a compelling case that the full-game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline, both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that, you know, we frankly feel has been right-sized, well-structured, and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. You know, the performance of Match Factory, the performance of Toon Blast, and the stable performance of many other big titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. You know, the -- our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely U.S.- and Western Europe-focused, and we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India, and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply under-penetrated. So, there are numerous, numerous opportunities for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to put your mind at ease, this isn't a, you know, stick a finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. You know, this is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omar Dessouky--Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "OK. And along kind of the same lines, I think a lot of people are going to be super excited about GTA VI coming out. Do you make any assumptions about the perhaps reacceleration of growth in the console installed base or console sales, you know, because your title may, you know, bring a lot of lapsed gamers back into the ecosystem in your forecasts?\n",
      "\n",
      "Strauss Zelnick--Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, we're using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So, for Gen 9 alone, their view is that there are about 81 million consoles worldwide currently. That was at the end of the last year. They project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you know, we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omar Dessouky--Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\n",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Shevins, senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. Thank you. You may begin.Nicole Shevins -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 ended March 31, 2024. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's chairman and chief executive officer; Karl Slatoff, our president; and Lainie Goldstein, our chief financial officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors.These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors. I'd also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP and all comparisons are year over year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. Our press release also contains a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. In addition, we have posted to our website a slide deck that visually presents our results and financial outlook. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss. Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we concluded fiscal 2024 with strength, including net bookings of $1.35 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Contributing to our positive results was the outperformance of NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and our newest hit, Match Factory; and the Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto series. During fiscal 2024, we generated net bookings of $5.33 billion, driven by our high-quality titles and our ability to engage consistently our player communities. With fiscal 2025 underway, our portfolio is gaining momentum and we have many exciting releases planned for the year. We expect net bookings to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of calendar 2025 to fall of calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We're highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. We've been executing our substantial cost reduction program, which we now anticipate will result in over $165 million of annual cost savings from our current and future expenses. This will enable us to run our business more efficiently and achieve greater operating leverage as our large-scale titles come to market. Now, turning to our performance during the quarter. NBA 2K24, which remains the No. 1 basketball simulation experience in our industry, surpassed our expectations as players responded to our promotions, in-game content strategy, and updates within seasons. To date, the title has sold-in over 9 million units. Engagement remains high, with nearly 2 million consumers playing daily. Our industry-leading NBA 2K brand also continued to expand its audience through several innovative mobile experiences, including NBA 2K24 MyTEAM, the new free-to-download mobile experience that allows players to sync progress between console and mobile devices as they play their favorite MyTEAM modes on the go; NBA 2K Mobile; and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition, which is consistently in the top 5 on Apple Arcade. The Grand Theft Auto series delivered another fantastic quarter, partially driven by an array of free content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including new vehicles, drag races, holiday-themed items to celebrate Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day, new community series jobs, and more. Unit sales for Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our forecast. And to date, the title has sold-in approximately 200 million units worldwide. We're thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35% and 23%, respectively, for the full year. Grand Theft Auto V also reclaimed its top spot as the most watched video game across all platforms, according to Streamhatchet, thanks largely to the tremendous viewership from the series' thriving role-play community. Rockstar's premium subscription service, GTA+, also continues to grow, with membership for the quarter almost doubling over the same period in the prior year as Rockstar continues to add valuable benefits to players. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our expectations and has sold-in nearly 64 million units worldwide. We continue to expand the audience for the series with Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare recently added to the roster of games included within the GTA+ library. Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts, and we're thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K's renowned internal studios in the coming weeks. We've already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox's catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We're also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film, which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer. WWE 2K24 has been a resounding success and is the highest-rated sports simulation of 2024. The title is also the highest-rated installment in the history of our popular wrestling franchise on Xbox, with an 83 average Metacritic score. Engagement has been exceptional, with players logging over 11 million hours across more than 110 million played matches. In addition, the Forty Years of WrestleMania Pack has the highest attach rate for a Super Deluxe DLC in the series' history, with more than 25% of WWE 2K24 players owning it. 2K and Visual Concepts are continuing to support the title and will have additional packs launching throughout the fall. I'd like to thank our friends Nick Kahn and Ari Emanuel over at WWE, TKO, and WME for their continued support. Additionally, I'd like to express our immense gratitude to our team at Visual Concepts for their outstanding work on our WWE 2K and NBA 2K franchises, which are both important annual contributors for our company. Zynga delivered outstanding results for the period, led by robust in-app purchases. Match Factory is accelerating and proving to be a hit, already establishing itself as a top 20 grossing game in the U.S. Apple App Store and reaching millions of new users with its launch on the Google Play Store. We're pleased that new bold beats and other exciting features have propelled average daily playtime to around 60 minutes per user. Toon Blast maintained its positive momentum, achieving nearly 20% growth of in-app purchases compared to the third quarter, driven by a new Dragons' Treasure competition and many other features. We'd like to congratulate the team at Peak for their incredible performance. Top Troops launched several content updates, as well as a major cross-media collaboration with the popular influencer MrBeast. The team plans to release additional enhancements to core gameplay and progression systems to drive further growth. Momentum continues at Rollic, with the studio crossing 3.5 billion all-time downloads and announcing a new partnership with Mattel to introduce a mass-market Barbie mobile game later this calendar year. Our blended monetization efforts in hyper-casual are progressing well within Rollic, which has resulted in Twisted Tangle and Screw Jam both becoming top 100 grossing games on the U.S. Apple App Store. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow, and our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive, owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we're eager to release worldwide this fiscal year, including Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends. In closing, I'm highly confident in our business, led by our top creative talent, our industry-leading portfolio of owned intellectual property, our sound balance sheet, and our increasingly efficient infrastructure. Our teams are laser-focused on our core tenets of creativity, innovation, and efficiency. And as we deliver our groundbreaking pipeline over the next several years, we're poised also to deliver industry-leading growth and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.Karl Slatoff -- President Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for their dedication and hard work as we continue to build the foundation for our future, which we believe is more promising than ever. We are extremely excited about our upcoming pipeline, which includes approximately 40 titles through fiscal 2027. Our updated release schedule reflects the actions of our recent cost reduction program, through which we canceled several titles to focus our efforts and resources on the franchises we believe represent our best opportunities to achieve significant critical and commercial success. These titles did not include any of our core franchises and were not expected to materially affect our net bookings growth. Turning to fiscal 2025. We have 16 titles in our pipeline, three of which have already been released. We have seven immersive core titles, including TopSpin, NBA, and, WWE 2K25, and the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises, with the first details coming in just a few short weeks at Summer Games Fest Kickoff Live. Of these titles, TopSpin 2K25 was released by 2K and Hangar 13 on April 26th. The revival of our popular tennis franchise has been well-received by critics and provides deep personalization, iconic venues, and industry-leading gameplay. With TopSpin 2K25, we continue to broaden our sports offerings, and 2K will support the title with season packs throughout the year. We have two independent titles from Private Division, the first of which is Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on April 18th into Early Access on PC. This new ARPG was well-received for its visceral combat, distinct art style, and rich narrative. Private Division, along with Weta Workshop, also announced Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned for release later this year. The teams recently revealed a new trailer for this cozy, hobbit life sim, which is set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R Tolkien. We have five mobile titles, including NFL 2K Playmakers, Star Wars Hunters, and Game of Thrones: Legends. NFL 2K Playmakers was released on April 23rd by 2K and Cat Daddy Games for iOS and Android devices. In this nonsimulation tactical card battle, players can collect NFL player cards to assemble an exciting roster while also experiencing a variety of game modes and features. We're proud to add NFL 2K Playmakers to our ever-growing mobile portfolio in partnership with the NFL and the NFL Players Association. Lastly, we have two new iterations of prior releases planned for this year. As always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, our pipeline for fiscal 2026 and 2027 has 24 titles planned, including 15 immersive core releases: six of which are sports simulation games; one independent title; five mobile games; and three new iterations of previously released titles. In closing, we believe that the many opportunities ahead of us will deliver a period of meaningful long-term growth, margin expansion, and shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and are entering fiscal 2025 with momentum, including healthy trends across our key franchises. Throughout the year, we released successful hit titles, engaged players with a steady cadence of in-game content, and continued to position our organization for the long term. We also deepened our commitment to efficiency and made some decisions that, while difficult, will align our resources with the initiatives for which we have the highest levels of conviction. We are confident that, over time, these steps will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our teams for their vision, passion, and dedication. Turning to our results. We delivered fourth quarter net bookings of $1.35 billion, which was above our guidance range of $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion. This reflected better-than-expected results from NBA 2K24; Zynga's in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast and Match Factory; the Red Dead Redemption series; and the Grand Theft Auto series. Recurrent consumer spending declined 2% for the period and accounted for 79% of net bookings. This was above our outlook, driven by the outperformance of NBA 2K2, Toon Blast, and Match Factory. Recurrent consumer spending declined for Grand Theft Auto Online, although it was up for virtual currency and GTA+. NBA 2K was in line with the prior year, and mobile increased slightly. During the quarter, we successfully launched WWE 2K24, which demonstrates 2K and Visual Concepts' ability to raise the bar further for our popular wrestling series. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.4 billion, while cost of revenue declined 24% to $930 million and included an impairment charge of $304 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased by 244% to $3.2 billion due to a goodwill impairment charge of $2.2 billion and $93 million of business reorganization expenses related to our recently announced cost reduction program. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 20% year over year, which was slightly above our guidance, due to higher personnel and IT expenses and professional fees. For fiscal 2024, we achieved net bookings of $5.33 billion, which was slightly above our revised guidance range of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. Recurrent consumer spending grew 2%, which exceeded our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. Recurrent consumer spending for mobile increased high single-digits; NBA 2K virtual currency and seasons was up slightly; and Grand Theft Auto Online virtual currency and GTA+ membership was flat. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $42 million, as compared to our outlook of approximately $100 million, due to higher external developer advances, cash tax, and interest payments. We spent approximately $142 million on capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. GAAP net revenue was flat at $5.35 billion, and cost of revenue increased 1% to $3.1 billion, which included an impairment charge of $577 million related to acquired intangible assets. Operating expenses increased 69% to $5.8 billion, due to an impairment charge of $2.3 billion related to goodwill and $105 million business reorganization charge related to our cost reduction programs. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 15% year over year and were slightly above our guidance, due to the factors I mentioned earlier that affected the fourth quarter. Today, we provided our outlook for fiscal 2025. We project net bookings to range from $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion, which represents 5% growth over fiscal 2024. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, an unannounced immersive core title from 2K, and Words With Friends. We expect recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 and to represent 76% of net bookings. Our recurrent consumer spending forecast assumes high single-digit growth for mobile, a slight increase for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% Zynga, 31% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow to be an outflow of $200 million, and we plan to deploy approximately $140 million for capital expenditures, primarily for game technology and office build-outs. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.57 billion to $5.67 billion and cost of revenue to range from $2.43 billion to $2.46 billion. Turning to operating expenses. We recently implemented a cost reduction program that is expected to deliver over $165 million of annual cost savings across our entire business. As part of these efforts, we have eliminated several projects in development that we did not anticipate would meet our financial benchmarks. We also took actions to streamline our organizational structure, which reduced both existing headcount and future hiring needs. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion, as compared to $5.83 billion last year. On a management basis, we expect operating expense growth of approximately 7% year over year, which is largely due to an increase in ongoing marketing support for Match Factory, as well as other mobile and immersive core launches planned for the year, partially offset by savings from our cost reduction program. Looking ahead and as Strauss mentioned earlier, we have narrowed the previously established release window for Grand Theft Auto VI to fall of calendar 2025 from calendar 2025. As development advances, our confidence in the title and its potential commercial impact continue to grow. That said, we are not providing specific guidance beyond fiscal 2025 as our release schedule includes numerous titles each year and even modest shifts can have a significant effect on results in any given period. Our outlook for the lifetime value of our pipeline remains as strong as ever, and we expect sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. Now, moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes TopSpin 2K25, No Rest for the Wicked on Early Access for PC, and NFL 2K Playmakers, all of which have already released, and Star Wars Hunters. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, the Grand Theft Auto series, Toon Blast, Empires & Puzzles, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Match Factory, the Red Dead Redemption series, Words With Friends, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to increase by approximately 1%, which assumes mid-single-digit growth in mobile, flat results for NBA 2K, and a decline for Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $928 million to $938 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 14% year over year, which is primarily driven by additional marketing for Match Factory, partially offset by our cost reduction program. In closing, we believe that we are very well-positioned to deliver the highest quality content in our industry and to enhance our profitability as we grow our scale and maintain our focus on efficiency. We are extremely excited about our path to the future, and we look forward to sharing more details about the many catalysts ahead for our company. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their dedication to our business and for creating the highest quality, most engaging entertainment franchises that captivate our global audiences. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your question.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Gearbox acquisition. In the past, you've expressed that you never really felt the need to own all of Gearbox. Here you are about to own all of Gearbox. Can you talk about how you think about now owning all of Gearbox and some of the opportunities that you'll have with that?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. What I was referring to is, when asked when Gearbox was sold to Embracer, whether that caused us to have any concern, my response was no because we have a long-term publishing agreement, and that's been mutually beneficial for our company and for Gearbox and as it was for Embracer. However, when the opportunity presented itself for us to acquire the company on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity. You know, we have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he's a hitmaker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and Tiny Tina was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So, we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.Eric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- Analyst OK. And then, Lainie, with regards to the annual cost savings that you announced, how much of that should be seen in fiscal '25?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, we'll start to see it in fiscal '25, but we'll see a full annualization of it in fiscal year '26. So, the majority of the plan was executed in Q4 and Q1, but it's -- pieces of it will come through this year.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey. Thank you. The ability of Rollic to launch top 100 grossing games is a really pleasant surprise. Just wondering if you could talk about how to think about the life cycle of those games. You know, typically, Rollic's games are sort of -- you know, they're hot for a while, and then they move on to something next -- something else. Is this going to be the case for these monetizing games as well or is it -- it planned to have a longer life cycle? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Undoubtedly, this so-called hybrid-casual approach should lead to longer life cycles because the hyper-casual approach really was, you know, put it out there, get a bunch of downloads, offer a rather light experience, you know, generate advertising revenue, have the users move on to the next. And that was great while it lasted. But, you know, long-term entertainment businesses are all driven by great content, and Rollic is proving that it has the ability with its partner studios to do just that and to deliver content that is durable and long-lasting. It remains to be seen whether we can truly create forever franchises at Rollic. I believe we can. We haven't done so yet, but we're off to a really good start.Doug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a couple for me. I guess, first off, on the change to the guidance and the outlook, what is your level of confidence, Strauss, in that calendar '25 launch of GTA VI, and is there any -- anything else more specific you can talk about what's behind that postponement? And then secondly, on the high single-digit mobile growth, I'm curious how much of that is related to any recovery you're seeing broadly in mobile gaming, or is that more specific to the increase in marketing spend and these titles that are outperforming your expectations for this year? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Colin. Well, we actually narrowed calendar 2025 to fall of 2025, and we feel really good about that release date. And obviously, we feel great about the title that is to come. And with regard to mobile, what we do at Zynga, because we are the market leader, of course, it's driven by the market in which we live. And it is gratifying that after a down year and then a slightly down year, we're heading into a flatter up year for the industry. Obviously, though, what's driving our expected results would be our hits, including Match Factory, which is performing really, really well. And we said that we were spending a lot in UA in the fourth quarter. We did, and that's turned out to be productive spending.Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst All right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Coss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess between the success you've had with Match Factory and some new launch titles, setting a release date for Star Wars Hunters, and then the incremental marketing behind mobile, it seems like there's definitely more momentum in that business, which is great to see. I guess, when we think about your analytical framework for investing in the marketing behind mobile, what are you targeting from a margin or payback perspective and when should we expect to see this investment turn into profitable flow-through from the mobile side?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, I hope, like everyone else, we look at these very same metrics, which is cost of acquisition; what kind of retention you expect, which is to say what kind of churn you get; the spending that you have on average; and therefore, the lifetime value. And the longer a payback period you're willing to accept, of course, the more risk you take in those calculations because they're all based on extrapolating from current data and past data, and they can change at any given time. So, I'm not prepared to share sort of, you know, our outside payback period. Suffice it to say, though, that we want to have a great deal of confidence that we're looking at a positive LTV.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you. And when would you expect to see, you know, mobile -- this investment that you're making in mobile flip from a cost center to, you know, driving incremental profit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, of course, our mobile division is profitable. I understand what you're asking, though, which is, frankly, just another way of asking the same question you asked before, which I declined to answer. However, I do give you extra credit points for rephrasing it in a way that I might dive into it. However -- so we don't share our exact payback periods. We do, however, tailor our user acquisition spending so that we expect a meaningfully positive LTV in a period of time such that we have confidence that even if we're wrong, we're not so wrong that we're not making money. I hope that clarifies it a bit.Matt Coss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst It does. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.Drew Crum -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, could you address your forecast for NBA 2K RCS in fiscal '25 for a slight increase? Is low single-digits growth the new normal for this going forward, or is there something unique in fiscal '25 that's influencing that view? Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we absolutely expect growth in NBA, and that's not just on the RCS side but also on the full-game sales side as well. This year is a little bit more challenging because we are still in the transition from Gen 8 to Gen 9, and Gen 9 is outperforming our expectations and doing fantastically well. I'd say we're a little bit more challenged on the Gen 8 side. As we continue to transition, I think we're going to see more tailwinds than headwinds in that regard. And when you look at the recurrent consumer spending, specifically -- when you look at it specifically as it relates to Gen 9, it's off the charts, it's fantastic. So, we've seen significant growth there. So, again, I think we will have momentum. Just as we transition to Gen 9 and as people continue to engage more deeply in the game, we're going to continue to see very strong RCS growth.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the change in bookings this year versus what you guys were talking about last quarter, how much comes from moving GTA versus any other shifts versus the restructuring. And then -- yeah, I guess I'll stop there. Thanks.Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer So, for fiscal year '25, the outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window from the calendar 2025 to fall, as we mentioned. There were also some other movements within the release schedule and also with our cost-cutting plan that is also part of the overall results for that year.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. And then a housekeeping question, does your current outlook reflects the acquisition of Gearbox, or is that going to be updated next quarter after it's closed?Lainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's not included since the transaction hasn't closed yet. So, we will expect to include it next quarter when we close, and we expect it to be slightly accretive to our management results.Benjamin Soff -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. First question, on GTA VI, with the narrowed window of release, is there any associated changes to your plan regarding the live service portion of GTA VI?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Rockstar hasn't given any details on what its expectations are for the release. It's been a wonderful trailer that they put out that broke the internet. And more news will come from Rockstar in the fullness of time.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you. I have a second question, on NBA, how is NBA's transition challenges in between console generations compared to other annually releasing titles on the market, either from 2K or from, you know, other external competitors? And do you attribute the challenges to -- mostly to 2K or to market?Karl Slatoff -- President I'm sorry, was your question about the transition from console generation from the last transition to this transition?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Right.Karl Slatoff -- President OK. So, that's going back quite some time; and frankly, I don't have the exact figures in front of me. But generally speaking, I would say that the delta between the games in this year, the Gen 9 game and Gen 8 game, is much broader, and I think that creates a more obvious difference between the two games. And frankly, I can't even remember if we had two completely separate games back then. But in any case, the delta is quite significant this time around, so I would expect that the transition is more -- the effect of the transition is more pronounced in this console generation. And I forget your second question. Was there another one?Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst If you do, how does it compare to other studios with annually recurring titles?Karl Slatoff -- President Yeah. We're not really commenting on our competitors. And most of our other studios, we don't have as much -- because NBA comes out every year, so you're going to see that transition more brightly. We don't have the same effect in most of our other games. Occasionally, we would, but they wouldn't be comparable games to NBA anyway. And again, like I said, we don't really comment about the -- our competitors and their experiences.Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, Karl.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Hey, Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nicole. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Strauss, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your expectations for the commercial impact from GTA VI have increased. I'm just curious if you could explain what's driving that up enthusiasm for the game. And then the second question, on your guidance, curious why you're not providing medium term. You've done that before, and it feels like, here, you have at least better visibility on the primary catalyst driving that growth. And then on '27, tying into that question, wondering where your confidence is that you can grow sequentially off '26. Is that sort of primarily the GTA ecosystem driving that growth in '27 or it's a combination of that and other AAA games that you plan to release? Thanks, guys.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mike, for those questions. I think our confidence continues to increase just because Grand Theft Auto V continues to perform so well. We've now sold-in over 200 million units. Every quarter, we continue to be pleased by the ongoing sales of the full game. And engagement in the past fiscal year with Grand Theft Auto V was up about 35% and Grand Theft Auto Online was up about 23%, I believe. That's extraordinary growth at this stage of the game, more than 10 years after the initial release. So, I think we feel as though the market's anticipation is at a fever pitch. And of course, expectations are very high everywhere in this boardroom and all around the world for the perfection of what Rockstar typically delivers. In terms of your question, I think you're asking in your second question, you know, why didn't we provide very specific guidance for our top-line number going forward? And the answer is, generally speaking, we have not done that except when it was necessary to clarify where we felt the company was going. We think, now, we're being very specific about this fiscal year and about the next couple of fiscal years by saying we expect, relating to your third question, sequential growth on top line, and we think that pretty much answers the question. Finally, the second part of your third question, is that driven by the GTA ecosystem? The answer is, certainly, we have expectations for that ecosystem and, again, given that full-game sales continue to be strong for GTA V this many years later. At the same time, we also have a number of other powerful releases coming, about which we're highly optimistic. And of course, we have current hits in the marketplace. Match Factory is a huge hit and only accelerating.Mike Hickey -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Thanks. Thanks, Strauss. Good luck, guys.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I could just ask a big picture one that's two parts. When you come out of the activity you just went through in terms of reevaluating your pipeline and looking at resource allocation across the organization, what were some of the key learnings on right -- the right mix of content is for you guys to meet your hurdle rate going forward and what were some of the key learnings of how much of the resource allocation decisions are now setting the company up on a multiyear view, or do you think they're going to be a continued refinement as you look to marry resources and the IP pipeline in the years ahead? Thanks so much.Karl Slatoff -- President So, in terms of looking at our pipeline, I mean, this is not really new to us. This is a process that we go through -- that we've been going through for at least the last 17 years since I've been here. And -- but what we -- what we're looking for specifically around this, this -- the look that we just took, is that we're looking -- we -- look, we understand in the industry right now that the biggest games are winning, and they're taking more share. And that's obviously a fact that we've noticed and take very seriously. And we're simply looking for the projects that we think have the highest chance for commercial success and for critical success and going through and combing through those and going through our pipeline and then making the tough choices. It's always difficult to cancel any projects. But in this context, it was something that was necessary and really part of our normalized process. So, we can -- we absolutely expect that that will continue in the future. This was a pretty tough look and a pretty big look, so I think most of that is behind us. But we will be adding and we will be subtracting over the next few years, and that's part of what we do. And it'll be both with the -- we will continue to invest in new IP as well. That is not off the table for us. That's very important. That's the lifeblood of the industry. And if you're not investing in new IP, we think it's a big mistake.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst I just had one question on GTA VI. This narrowing from calendar '25 to the fall of '25, do you think there's an ancillary benefit to that of sort of syncing up with the holiday season, or do you feel like GTA is such a powerful franchise that it really doesn't confer any sort of incremental benefit?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now.Jason Bazinet -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of James Heaney with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. What have been some of the unlocks on the mobile side of the business? You did call out the better-than-expected results in Zynga's IP business, but just curious if there's anything you could say specifically on the advertising side of the business. Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, we have two important businesses within mobile, in-app purchases and advertising, and they're both relevant. We took a hit on advertising as we rethought our hyper-casual business and turned it into a blend of hybrid-casual business where there are in-app purchases as well. At the same time, we built up advertising inside mobile by putting advertising units in games that previously did not have them. In any case, advertising should be a meaningful growth area for us in the mobile business. With regard to in-app purchases, we have the same opportunities and limitations that any other mobile company has, and our ability to grow in-app purchases is driven by our ability to have people download and play hit titles. That's what we're focused on.James Heaney -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. I'm curious if you guys would talk about the broader PC strategy. I know that there's just tons and tons of engagement, particularly for GTA on PC. Not all of that gets monetized. I think, in the past, you've described that as, you know, maybe it's a good thing to have that there. You don't necessarily need to monetize all of it. But there are some interesting products out there, Overwolf and the like. And so, maybe I'm just curious what you guys are seeing or thinking about your opportunity to unlock monetization on PC. Thanks.Karl Slatoff -- President So, we look at the PC platform as we do with any platform, and it all starts with content, first and foremost. And we agree, it's a very powerful platform and we've got some very strong third-party partners, also the ability for us to sell directly to the consumer. So, these are all compelling things for us, and we'll continue to develop and support the PC platform as long as the gamer is there. Wherever the gamer is, that's where we're going to be. And again, I don't really see us looking at the PC monetization any differently than we would on any other platform. It really is more about game-to-game. You know, what works for certain games, what doesn't work for certain games. And the overarching edict that we live by is over-deliver on content and the monetization will follow.Clay Griffin -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Great. Thanks, Karl.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you for taking the questions. We saw Rockstar announce a price increase for GTA+. I recognize it's been several years, but can you help us think through the rationale? And as you look ahead to GTA VI, what are your latest thoughts around the pricing dynamics for the franchise or your portfolio, in general, as these games continue to get larger with more robust experiences? Thank you.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, there's more content constantly being made available, and, you know, we really aim to deliver great value at any given time. We're so focused on delivering more value than what we charge. And that's sort of the rubric. And any time we establish a price, we want to make sure that it's good news for the consumer, that the experience vastly over-delivers in the context of the cost. That's the goal.Chris Schoell -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Sure. I have two questions, one on mobile and then just one again on the sequential growth. So, is there any more color at all you can give us on how you're going to grow sequentially in fiscal '27 after lapping just such a tough comp in fiscal '26 when GTA VI is going to launch? It just seems counterintuitive. When I look back at the last two times Rockstar released a mega title, you know, Red Dead Redemption in fiscal '19, fiscal 20 did not grow; and Grand Theft Auto V in fiscal '14, fiscal 15 was down 30%. I'm just kind of trying to square those couple of things there. You know, will it be Rockstar that continues to drive that sequential growth in fiscal '27? Any more color there would be really great.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, that's a fair question. Look, the business has really changed and -- certainly since 2019 and absolutely since 2015 and in ways that are obvious now and in ways that we project in the future. This sequential growth is driven by our overall pipeline, and we're now a large and diversified company. And we do have GTA VI coming. We have great aspirations for GTA VI. And as I said earlier, we've been selling full-game GTA Vs for over 10 years, and we continue to sell more in a given year than most other stand-alone releases sell in their first year, even at our big competitors' companies. So, we actually think that there's a compelling case that the full-game sales will continue to be robust for years to come. Equally, we have a pipeline, both announced and unannounced, that's very exciting. We have an annualized pipeline that will, of course, continue to come that's quite significant. And we have a mobile business that, you know, we frankly feel has been right-sized, well-structured, and is now back in growth mode. And there's evidence of that. You know, the performance of Match Factory, the performance of Toon Blast, and the stable performance of many other big titles. There are also geographical growth opportunities that we're very focused on. We don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but it's a huge part of our strategy. You know, the -- our business and our competitors' businesses remain largely U.S.- and Western Europe-focused, and we think there are enormous opportunities for growth in Asia, India, and Africa, where we and everyone else who isn't located in those geographies are deeply under-penetrated. So, there are numerous, numerous opportunities for growth. But to put your mind at ease, this isn't a, you know, stick a finger in your mouth and hold it in the air and hope for the best kind of number. You know, this is driven by our release schedule and our pipeline.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. And along kind of the same lines, I think a lot of people are going to be super excited about GTA VI coming out. Do you make any assumptions about the perhaps reacceleration of growth in the console installed base or console sales, you know, because your title may, you know, bring a lot of lapsed gamers back into the ecosystem in your forecasts?Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we're using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial. So, for Gen 9 alone, their view is that there are about 81 million consoles worldwide currently. That was at the end of the last year. They project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027. Now, you know, we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate.Omar Dessouky -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.OperatorThank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Strauss Zelnick, for any closing comments.Strauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Before we sign off, I just want to thank everyone who works at Take-Two and all of our affiliates. These have been challenging times. And in addition to delivering hits, we've asked everyone to dig deep and make sure the business is highly efficient, right-sized, and that's challenging. And one of the most extraordinary things about our organization is the amazing morale and focus on the common good. We're here for our customers, for our -- first and foremost, for our colleagues who deliver to our customers every day, and for our shareholders. And we're extraordinarily excited, both about the position we're in, about the fiscal year in which we're currently operating, and about our amazing pipeline and the years ahead. Thank you for joining us today.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Nicole Shevins -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsStrauss Zelnick -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerKarl Slatoff -- PresidentLainie Goldstein -- Chief Financial OfficerEric Handler -- ROTH MKM -- AnalystDoug Creutz -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystColin Sebastian -- Robert W.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [2]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. \\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. \\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. \\nIn addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. \\nRevenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. \\nWe saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. \\nDespite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. \\nWe sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. \\nAs we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. \\nSecond, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. \\nAnd third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. \\nNext, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. \\nThe services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. \\nThe reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. \\nTurning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. \\nTurning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. \\nWe started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. \\nApple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. \\nWe announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. \\nWe also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. \\nIn the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. \\nWe also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. \\nAs always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. \\nAs we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. \\nBut before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. \\nWe are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. \\nCreating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. \\nToday, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca? \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. \\nAs we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. \\nHowever our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. \\nGross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong, at $11.6 billion. \\nFor details by product, I start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone 6 grew 40% as we entered last March quarter, and supply demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. \\nAlso, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units, while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter with in our five to seven-week target range for channel  inventory. iPhone ASV was $642 compared to $659 in the year ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year. \\niPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among US corporate buyers planning to purchase smart phones in the June quarter, 78% planned to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago. \\nTurning to services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter. \\nNext, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit market growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE. \\nJust last week, we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, fastest flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. \\nTurning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range. In the same segments of the public market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 78% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by ABC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the US commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education. \\niPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3 times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%. \\nRevenue from other products grew 30% over the last year, thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries, and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways, with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. \\nWe're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries. \\nWe see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, using doctors and nurses are using iOS Apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively, so that they can spend more time with patients, and less time on administrative tasks. \\nLet me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. \\nWe issued $15.5 billion in US dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt. We returned   $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $7 billion on purchases of 71.8 million Apple shares, to open market transactions. \\nWe have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we are allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, and the value we see in our stock. The Board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle, less the employee restricted stock units. \\nWe also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the Board has declared today is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. \\nWe continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price. \\nAs in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash, future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the face of the program. \\nAs we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline, as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year, when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year, and the strong US dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. \\nEmbedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth  over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. \\nSequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales, and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get further from the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and as iPhone SE enters the mix. \\nWe know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference counts primarily from three areas: First, the $2 billion plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned. Second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction, and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE. Third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at the rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters. \\nWe expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue, and a differing mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. \\nWe expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [5]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thank you, Luca.  \\n(Caller Instructions) \\nOperator, may we have the first question, please? \\n\\n\\n================================================================================\\nQuestions and Answers\\n================================================================================\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [1]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          (Operator Instructions) \\nFirst, we hear from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSimona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [2]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          My first question was actually just a clarification, in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? The bigger question, Tim was, with the smart phone market now reaching a pretty mature growth base, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically? \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [3]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Simona, let me give you the data point on the sell through and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [4]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Simona, this is Tim. In terms of do I think the smart phone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. We're very optimistic that this too shall pass, and that the market and particularly us will grow again. \\nThe reason that we're optimistic is we look at sort of the three places that iPhone sales come from, and from an upgrade point of view, as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing. \\nAs we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we have set a record from switchers from other platforms. The largest we've ever seen in any six month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. \\nThe next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform, with incredible product that is at a new price point for us, with the latest technology. And so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and were very excited about what's in our pipeline. All of those things make me optimistic. \\nYour other question was on M&A, and regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we to, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we are excited about. As I have said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we have bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit, and whether it's  a great technology and great people. We continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSimona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [5]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thank you. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [6]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Thank you. Could we have the next question please? \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOperator    [7]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [8]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          Good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends, and specifically you mentioned that the SE is going to impact, but how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there, and your actual market share, and using price to close that gap? Is it just the SE or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted, to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets? \\nAnd one for Luca. Can you talk a little bit about the services segment, in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus the growth basis that you  have referred to in the past. Thanks. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [9]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n           I think the SE is attracting two types of customers. One is   customers that wanted the latest technology, but wanted it in a more compact package. And we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. \\nSecondly, it's attracting people aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we are really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new to iPhone customers that we see from here, because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I will let Luca comment on the ASPs. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [10]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          On the ASPs, Gene we mentioned that we were going to be down sequentially, and this is really the combination of two factors. So when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter, is the fact that we are having the SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP, and also this channel inventory reduction that we have talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. \\nThe question on services, when we look at our services business, obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element, and the part of the services business that is growing very well, we \""
