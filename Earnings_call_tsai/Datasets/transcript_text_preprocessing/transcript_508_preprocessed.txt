summary remark open call question scottscott bibaud president chief executive officer thanks frank see made great progress toward commercialization past quarter everything power get st production quickly also incredibly valuable portfolio potential customer working take commercial stage team confident matter time announce license deal solidify potential atomeras business future mike take questionsmike bishop ok thanks scott wish ask question please click qa button bottom zoom window feel free type question best aggregate incoming query relay management alternatively click raise hand button may call ask question live right first question come richard shannon craighallum richard please go aheadrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst thanks mike thanks scott frank getting call congratulation great success ending last year maybe couple question related stmicro time frame product prioritization one half two year sound like talking interesting work want get ahead ski reason think time frame could lower end engagement want read much want get thought scottscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah say predict timing actually given u schedule trying hit however say progress made last couple month since installation really quick experience know possibility moving fast know mst installed inside someone fab literally crank engine turn new wafer experiment quickly chance would say would say still holding know one half two year announcement date last may chance could earlier endrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst say gotten schedule stmicro expect kind way characterize mean normal process bringing semiconductor process specific atomera create know deviation normal guessscott bibaud president chief executive officer think anything deviation normal case said privy consider normal development time frame analog product like know know customer may done lot development work phase get phase done people remember st phase work long time ago kind put shelf taking brandnew process node work try mean think going get good result first run goal spread mst lot place get good result across component designsrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enough followon question topic stmicro talked since day announced back april last year talked guess refer halo effect driving company want adopt mst maybe characterize discussion guess key people need see production actually chip coming factory pull trigger think accelerator catalyst thenscott bibaud president chief executive officer definitely already accelerator catalyst conversation customer know discussing business model would like see say yes recognize st go great past could say u nobody ever done think really big game changerrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok well great hear talked last quarter term think used word license mstcad large analog manufacturer example halo effect separate even started st publicizedscott bibaud president chief executive officer think definitely example halo effect course trying convince guy announced st actually work seeing st caused take next level hope mstcad first step kind moving along actual installation license although know announced yet hope trajectory richard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok well kind coopted followon question topic next step internally could characterize plus know public event speak like license mentionedscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah mean look talked productization effort st starting work tcad mstcad addon standard tcad add mst stuff know customer would know semiconductor industry would say majority manufacturer want see actual physical result piece silicon make decision player industry want run simulation first make decision move silicon think really good path prepared support path show seriousness small deal dedicate engineer expensive synopsys tcad seat working exclusively integrating mst process technology hope go someplace goodrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok assuming since described large analog manufacturer something would install use internally opposed working somebody else like perhaps current engaged atomera customer fairscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah think would work engaged atomera customer think every company globe today even idm probably fablight use outside foundry well inside capacity guy could go either direction yeahrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok two quick question get line sure couple others want ask question related jda sound like made progress discussion business unit detect anything imminent hopeful want put word mouth maybe characterize dynamic think gotten past point certain learning cycle gone think last two think two year correctscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah mean done lot stuff shown lot data way continuing technical work show even result thing done mst started discussion business side know kind fourth quarter completed yet think unusual obviously give detail exactly discussion type thing take time christmas holiday certainly slow every big company got lot thing happening end year goal setting reorg conversation discussion everything definitely feel like bit distracted end year january started really try get ramped back hopefully make better progress nowrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enough last question jump line signed license unnamed fable rf customer think back like something like heard much since yet talk every quarter sound like great engagement rfsoi general maybe characterize specific customer since announcement recently overlap commentary rfsoi mentioned today past scott bibaud president chief executive officer yes sorry definitely overlap still working customer still development hope turn something good future probably could done better job prepared remark connecting particular customer rfsoi work something continuing quite excited aboutrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enough jump line scott thank youscott bibaud president chief executive officer right thanks richardmike bishop thanks richard next question come cody acree benchmark cody go aheadcody acree benchmark company analyst yeah thanks taking question congrats progress year frank real clear guidance q said ratable stmicro license clear expecting first quarterfrank laurencio chief financial officer oh yeah referring stmicro talking licensed revenue mstcad large amount go detail think past largest revenue single quarter mstcad know larger engagement still kind range yeah separate stmicrocody acree benchmark company analyst ok thank clarification impact delay tsi understand rd push lumpiness come next year later year business impact delayfrank laurencio chief financial officer see business impact delay none wafer would go customer kind whether know certainly st installed everything quick turn fab customersthat would sending wafer u mst deposition never flow tsi either tsi solely vehicle u able internal rd testing impact customer term know longerterm rd yeah prolonged inability work foundry would impact u seeing actually much higher spend first three quarter previous year tsi part price increase kind faster turnaround able kind got q anticipate winding run quite wafer use additional internal testing tcad calibration keeping u plenty busy close discussion know signing new foundry anticipate going hurt u commercially allcody acree benchmark company analyst excellent thank scott maybe talk bit engagement mst sp spx new engagement mentioned prepared remarksscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah sure else say maybe talk mean license mstcad mstcad software package sits top synopsys tcad software give people analyze performance mst could bring particular customer want kind comprehensive analysis mst could get added product line mean fairly big installation charging monthly level able use providing quite bit support frequently case customer expert highervoltage technology going use mst spx sp packaged product look use trick figured mst make product better train put trick trade development change existing design get higher performance level talked little bit trend highervoltage chip going china seeing definitely many player trying either make existing portfolio higher performance lower cost compete better chinese fabscody acree benchmark company analyst see thank scott lastly mentioned increased interest dram around chiplet strategy seeing engagement dram material road map plausibilityscott bibaud president chief executive officer talking dram manufacturer little anything announce yet definitely still discussion number company specifically related chiplets something think would used chiplets like memory technology talking people dram talking people memory architecture even work mst could help change memory architecture make responsive need ai memory demand number thing working rd announced yet hope turn something sooncody acree benchmark company analyst would characterize fairly early stage yetscott bibaud president chief executive officer work dram manufacturer early stage work would say earlier stage yescody acree benchmark company analyst ok thank guysmike bishop right thanks cody couple question qa line scott mentioned soitec prepared comment question came involved soitecs technology smartsic production stmicro yearscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah working soitec number year guy know talking rfsoi benefit bring long time would say good percentage rfsoi delivered market delivered soitec working ensure product work well announced kind partnership kind engagement joint customer like question asking stmicro certainly hope customer would using rfsoi would interested working u soitecmike bishop right one frank comment increase sale marketing expense fourth quarter want address thatfrank laurencio chief financial officer yeah think kind applies actually across area operating expense saw revenue q important milestone one thing impact expense across know department annual bonus accrue achieve certain milestone important milestone like q certainly increased amount know bonus accrual quarter otherwise though sale marketing spotty lot travel certainly spent lot time year traveling customer would read anything know travel overall across company accrual bonus always linear every quartermike bishop ok request update chip act news put last year wondering scott could provide update chip actscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah course talked last year mean think chip act really provides tailwind u many way especially establishment new national semiconductor development center talking gotten involved lot know announcement involvement arizona arizona state university thing chip act know early round rfqs chip act putting people building fabs first big company building fabs mediumsized company really eligible lot work get engaged government different level could eligible work chip act area nothing announce tell something working onmike bishop ok see richard shannon hand richard followup questionrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst mike thank scott going reask cody last question different topic asked kind maturity work dram space thanks answer turn around throw advanced node want get update ultimately characterizing situation relative dram dynamic workflow know consistent know work done area like power rfsoi etcscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah think interesting exactly type work power rfsoi let address thing first advanced node size working small really required u new rd prove capability prove develop film deliver tiny process geometry still effective done working conjunction advanced node customer really guided u toward would need able bring solution also think past put paper maybe even white paper thing useful one surface roughness scattering improvement quite technical different scattering mechanism happen transistor sending electron across impede mobility electron flow get small process geometry one difficult scattering mechanism gotten – gotten lot worse surface roughness actually proved mst rare solution least improvement surface roughness scattering something garnering attention lot industry participant actually earlier fall put white paper talked little bit earnings call random dopant fluctuation small process node imagine feature transistor several silicon atom wide dopant fluctuation dopants moving wrong place real problem one big advantage mst help tamp surface roughness scattering mean sorry random dopant fluctuation also true mean almost thing also true memory maker memory maker dealing incredibly tiny geometry working advanced node similar problem know area talked let answer one little part question one interesting thing solution area implemented blanket wafer meaning make mst wafer get integrated rest process flow would kind starting wafer use run thing start talking something like first potential easier integrate therefore faster time revenue secondly give u opportunity partner player industry wafer provider able might give u real easy channel getting success semiconductor manufacturer people use much lowertemperature manufacturing process use type solution true advanced node sometimes rfsoi wellrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok great color scott think absorb one get queue thank mike bishop right one last question qa line mst stmicro going used smart power productsscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah nothing announce yet obviously stmicro big company think learning technology one thing new installation fab try technology would delighted tried something else decided good certainly encouraging type behaviormike bishop right well want proceed closing
