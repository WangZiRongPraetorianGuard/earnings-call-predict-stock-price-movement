progress shown across board local social program investment working community right stand know federal government also province voting new expected new chief minister essentially provincial head government important mining lot legislation within province rather center know right continue country second question around nevada see final chart pickup broader turnaround happening mark goldrush finally kicking know nevada team really starting make progress know put lot effort big merger two distinct culture covid big turnover saw right across united state economy effectively people refer skill shortage really invest lithium miner promoter biggest miner yous supplier people promotional effort brought turnover materially nevada got new management team much caring way might tough standard soft people give example look roaster performance last two quarter last year back right beginning gold quarry roaster spend lot time money really starting live better efficiency got final leg expansion middle year increase throughput spent lot time sage mill whole sage infrastructure getting back wanted core turquoise ridge one major highgrade deposit longlife deposit within complex actually last week saturday last saturday really encouraging managing rock mechanic way mining turquoise ridge open stoping back full also cut full much larger scale used safely efficiently know confident start seeing cost come gram ore body got lot going get autoclave working got one big change flow sheet autoclave sage done greg put formed team autoclave expert barrick biggest operator autoclave world done got around world put group process engineer together look autoclave installation see really learn lift game best practice really uncovered bottleneck sage mill depressurizing autoclave frequently largely around valve longevity valve reason got missing component able normalize pressure across valve turn big step forward large expense finished design got many example put place key step forward done lot know sage got team working process optimization automation far process control go really stage operator management speed next step use automation putting automation without competent operating team efficient way get increase throughput got completely new team roaster carlin performing kpis long time since done around mean commentary real excited improvement dampening cost moment made decision bring contractor get ahead development double refractory ore come big highgrade deposit process constrained far roaster nearly processed quite improved efficiency flexibility mine big mine flexibility big mining complex know producing million ounce year worried catching ounce found lack flexibility underground moving whole business underground development know better anyone get behind development constrain mining flexibility got problem deal fall ground sort operational issue underground mine brought contractor help team get ahead month program impact cost extra cost take back contractor fullness time around nevada better spot know think see last year bad start increased performance every quarter quite catch continue year see performance improve year believe building said last year largely complete merger challenge focusing efficiency deliverylawson winder bank america merrill lynch analyst hi mark excuse lawson winder bank america thank much presentation today love chart fiveyear production gold cost forecast particular cash cost effectively chart showing allin sustaining cost declining range range question would mean barricks objective next five year move per ounce use today reserve planning per ounce five year followup would ask know inflation assumption built mark bristow president chief executive officer allin sustaining cost come thousand correct see flat year year let graham comment way manage input model exactly right point know tell work one ever look grade think analyst lot people look cost industry high grading look barricks grade high grading grade next five year almost flat manage optimization ore body sure time sort look little different market put chart different market cost driver let tell first one pv pv lowcost operator even current challenge going know one lowest cost mine going come even steady ounce goldrush focused development able last three year come cost goldrush cost profile higher next two year ramp put infrastructure get ventilation standard thing like know big challenge porgera sits ounce model rampup long also lowcost producer driver carlin crossroad challenge large chunk modeled high grade faulted need work get cost way carlin structured big ship take bit time turn see carlin grade sort high grade got open pit embedded nothing well let rephrase explain cost systemic operating cost driven specific decision event want explain assumptionsgraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah sure key thing lawson always cost energy know always say around cost energy directly indirectly look energy term way impact reagent consumables term way impact supply chain knockon cost supplier input cost probably like look real impact energy across group always going key driver using brent assumption year pretty close spot think spot moment little higher average looking today long term bring longterm planning beyond key area input price pressure labor labor make around direct cost seeing inflationary pressure year year around small impact cost input cost know relatively similar know able bring lot cost compared area still sticky particularly regionally north america thing like cement lime explosive steel still little bit inflationary pressure area working bring yeah made lot progress really key driver term first question really know planning reduce longterm planning price answer continue plan said past always look input cost use determining longterm planning price certainly going lower make lot money lock profitabilityralph profiti eight capital analyst mark thanks ralph profiti eight capital spent time talking nevada gold mine wanted address reserve replacement done lot work sort fiveyear plan think position enough data outlook yearoveryear reserve replacement consistent similar grade profile going look little bit latent know operating mine diminish toward later end guidance period see pickupmark bristow president chief executive officer modeling know budgeted replacement nevada year north america beat replacement efficient drilling go next five year still lumpy nevada lot reserve underground build resource inventory conversion behind pointed able point fiveyear program five year nevada replace gold mine inventory lot reliable know move know inferred indicated measured model lot know like leeville work process key reason shift capital greenfields target systematic caught drilling well catching year quite big expense drilling development getting ahead cover reserve grade control confidence part know good underground mining practice able reallocate budget greenfields target got lot number greenfields target look fourmile look way managed exactly one mile away cortez multimillion ounce million ounce goldrush substantially higher grade go breach flatter sort planar ore body go big brittle halo around intrusive rock behaving differently give really chunky grade brecciashaped ore body question many give example shared drill hole last quarter mega pit turquoise ridge old twin creek drew hole mega pit tier ore body carlin area whole carlin region one ever found feeder know feeder one really deliver value carlin system drew hole significant know meter ore grade slowly getting enough data vector really test concept got whole little boulder basin got north southern extension turquoise ridge underground mine back looking getchell confidence able manage rock mechanic know rock mechanic everywhere got none underground control able mine safely without know really getting impacted poor ground condition give u much confidence go back getchell got extension north leeville call greater leeville geologist come four different name mind greater leeville area north got another new target shared map know trying model goldrushfourmile trend another carlin trend look duplication structural duplication big focus team said geology team got know exploration like silo mrm today got integrated team really understands challenged draw said like budget need drill hole drill hole within three mile said look got like already ahead pushing know think real opportunity opportunity outside joint venture area well nevada chasinganita soni cibc world market analyst hi mark anita cibc couple quick question first one kibali think said guy sorry loulu pit wall failure cleaned impact grade going yearmark bristow president chief executive officer mean impacting profile still putting rampdown knew would slide expect go way bottom mean know open pit mining monitor pit wall time time time fail best know one get injured got focused control pit wall stability see cominganita soni cibc world market analyst ok secondly going ask fourmile went little bit could give u idea much fourmile resource would expected included pfs term like base would working withmark bristow president chief executive officer let answer first one differently fourmile starting come year plan rolled forward year information know deal put formile newmont partner get feasibility study meet certain criterion newmont need pay dilute agreement mean know good relationship newmont nevada joint venture level view need continue show prospectivity think currently reserve recall million ounce simon want take anita thatsimon bottom mineral resource management evaluation executive yeah currently got million ounce third got small amount indicator resource base expecting define end year support initial prefeasibility study prefeasibility study see first several incremental study continue expand ore body course year well

market analyst ok right good thank questionjackie przybylowski bmo capital market analyst think jackie przybylowski bmo thanks much mark another question fourmiles hope mind mentioned mda considering service portal decouple project goldrush think wording used ultimately complement goldrush development talk little bit mean would consider keeping outside joint venture operating separately processed mill infrastructure mean graham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer answer firstmark bristow president chief executive officer graham clearly scared going say process touched get joint venture got demonstrate viability time always negotiable option key look goldrush optimal access access twin decline come hill got get ore processing facility looking two access one attractive northern access sixkilometer drive brings ore valley close processing facility make good sense logistics time drive drive strike open entire area infull drilling easy move trying bank body surface expensive exercise give idea take section rose sophia access twin drive goldrush intention agreement use nevada joint venture infrastructure access drilled area would save million difference trying drill closedspace hole surface going simon want show viability prefeasibility question got decide take part know feasibility pas test sit newmont structure reasonable way bringing asset absolutely critical longterm profile nevada gold mine form know highlevel conversation concept engaged formal discussion point view important u demonstrate shareholder value world classasset allocated part global exploration budget work year threeyear program get donegraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer crystal clear jackie intention would always would come joint venture saying saying could access separate accessjackie przybylowski bmo capital market analyst appreciate thank one question different topic mind walking u maybe process restarting porgera modeling help would expect year go rent could maybe give u color term q might look like would helpful thank youmark bristow president chief executive officer know papua new guinea jackie got ounce guidance attributable year think spent bit time explaining know start soon start generating revenue even high cost start paying back care maintenance cost sweep nonland owner equity start repaying cash flow start moving fairly quickly give hurdle end quarter better sort better granularity commissioned plant run nongold material starting gear put gold contained material processing plant best produce gold certain oxide material need power supply switch autoclave next step right deployed secured helicopter work team erect think three four power pylon toppled put back place working community hela gavana different province operate make sure secure gasfired power supply mine need able run mine properly built year rampup think end quarter much better outlook granularity goinggraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah would say much second half year profile jackie produce gold first half really second half expect produce majority guidance mark spoke aboutmark bristow president chief executive officer well track done better expected employing people ramping employment still got security issue dealing know close follow papua new guinea right port moresby day security capacity government pressure working one thing everyone appreciates mean couple year doubt importance porgera economy papua new guinea profitable business deliver real value economymartin pradier veritas investment research analyst martin pradier veritas investment research question lumwana expecting cost reduction going forward know cost increasing lot year give u detail thatmark bristow president chief executive officer definitely see short reduction cost year guidance see big focus moment still prestripping call plan plan super pit martin point mining cost critical mining efficiency mining cost real driver expansion see cost come mobilize machine make sure start mining big thing first establish pit mine efficiently simon want add thatgraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes would say right big step cost get efficienciesmark bristow president chief executive officer simon want commentsimon bottom mineral resource management evaluation executive yes mean obviously efficiency also come scale expand expansion currently mining annual run rate million tonne move incrementally course four five year stepping million tonne per annum stepup obviously scale economy also shifting much larger fleet line new fleet gradually bringing lumwana started come online end last yearmark bristow president chief executive officer answer rightmartin pradier veritas investment research analyst thinking would like lower cost much usmark bristow president chief executive officer sure simon number headmartin pradier veritas investment research analyst unreasonablesimon bottom mineral resource management evaluation executive yes rangemark bristow president chief executive officer ok right want move operator move people online please question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come daniel major ubs please go aheaddaniel major ubs analyst hi mark graham hear okmark bristow president chief executive officer yeah hear perfectly thanks daviddaniel major ubs analyst well thanks yeah couple question yeah first one couple around capex first one kind reasonably simple one much guidance within guidance story included early development spend lumwana reko diqmark bristow president chief executive officer want answer thatgraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer reko diq capital guidance million share right please million project lumwana capital spend milliondaniel major ubs analyst thanks second one look slide fiveyear forecast see capex coming billion head toward sort finalization budget kind major project feeling term range capex previously given continued inflation since estimate given still right kind ballpark expect capex edge previous range gave reko diq lumwanamark bristow president chief executive officer answer based prefees number thereabouts remember moving toward feasibility study proper design expect tidy capital estimate toward end year right got reason change numbersgraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer yes right mean think dan key lot tradeoff study going moment know would imagine involves potentially putting capex getting opex benefit team busy finish work updated number come operating cost well yes still ballparkmark bristow president chief executive officer dan build worth noting lumwana going one step ahead reko diq expansion lycopodium partner working team really looking lever purchasing power way design thing duplication design lot benefit running like running mega mine development expect see efficiency benefit thatdaniel major ubs analyst one could reserve assumption graham mentioned sticking gold side three buck pretty conservative copper front know management team year conservative assumption good reason number going stay move higher would change way design copper expansionsmark bristow president chief executive officer think dan strategy question really find number particularly look gold deposit got outlier seen mda particularly tongon got full capital repayment sustaining capital low tongon adjust want leave gold ground toward end mine generally look barricks ore body change add waste low grade ore body shape still within envelope follow saying similarly copper course look marginal opportunity higher copper price always done know even used like remember maybe big pit yalea took gold price went took whole lot gold high grade low recovery took could push back six month could access gold paid strip really good business manage flexibility inherent specific ore body right gold deposit really defines geological boundary store copper project grow understanding reko diq reconsidering right even know spent lot time simon lumwana stuff tight get whole economic ore body geology envelope simon want add thatsimon bottom mineral resource management evaluation executive think covered well yeahgraham shuttleworth senior executive vice president chief financial officer thing would point dan lift resource price copper resource year reflect know guess point making risk copper seems upside wanted make sure sterilizing asset opportunity certainly take board point copper price could go little highermark bristow president chief executive officer fundamental reason use resource want keep infrastructure away ore body resource certainly ambitious number look payability even pueblo viejo reko diq want make sure put infrastructure good example go escondida zaldivar find infrastructure pit expensive move like inaudible thing like thatdaniel major ubs analyst ok thank muchoperatorthe next question come bob brackett bernstein research please go aheadbob brackett alliancebernstein analyst good afternoon mentioned adjective assigned included

mine know looking lot position filled like training program going underground mine trying get understanding theremark bristow president chief executive officer turnover substantial fourteen interesting training mine people go trading mine far got lot data generally stay got properly skilled people stress life know thing know first phase putting two mine together important conversation people go smash two different culture together force building business mining industry look across mining industry look executive group executive group mining industry entrenched much barrick team put enormous amount time effort skill base first one greg walker need get everyone together iron discrepancy disparity sort stuff bring union unionized workforce embedded call open cost side business
