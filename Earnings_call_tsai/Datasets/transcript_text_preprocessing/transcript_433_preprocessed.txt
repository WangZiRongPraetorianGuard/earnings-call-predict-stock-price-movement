blood test would widely adopted main guideline group uspstf sophisticated modeling modeling net two key factor one life year gained life year gained model come precancer detection second factor come question unnecessary colonoscopy generated per people screened see model bar anything believe objective difficult get guideline performance characteristic see today category test think really digging uspstf guideline anybody investing anybody studying space road lead longterm commercial traction impactoperatoryour next question come line dan brennan cowen line opendan brennan td cowen analyst great thank thanks taking question guy maybe first one would everett mentioned wondering kind finished year kind guy baking traction b kevin could go back question bloodbased appreciate exactly said completely fair hard u untangle would build model kind untangle u tried way think bluntly data hit like kind pretty open biological barrier blood wondering assuming specificity know still view like likely outcome data upside case know would kind make worry thank youkevin conroy chairman chief executive officer well take look fit test reason fit test model well detects precancerous polyp false positive right false positive rate like blood test know false positive rate imagine test every year generates twice many unnecessary colonoscopy fit test also blood test let u say detects teen term precancers drive life year gained difficult place get onto efficient frontier called rough modeling comparing fit test see blood test generate lot false positive also generate enough life year gained cost significantly fit test certainly guideline group considers broad parameter look including including b rated test hard become b rated test go back real value created cologuard set bar test developing based upon input start way designed cologuard make sure would efficient frontier modeling exercise feel confident year year come colonoscopy cologuard two leading test seeing today cologuard take share away fit test colonoscopy volume screening colonoscopy volume changed meaningful way decade right around million million screening colonoscopy per year changing backlog growing challenge get patient challenge make hit easy button challenge make sure every patient turn think colon cancer screening think cologuard difficult challenge fortunately built team technology platform built purpose achieve goalsjeff elliott chief financial chief operating officer dan jeff one many way exact competitively unique almost three year working build awareness penetrate younger population mean approaching screening revenue today massive growth driver expect continue look need kevin said relatively limited capacity colonoscopy country add million people screening pool like guideline

continue operatoryour next question come line vijay kumar evercore isi line openvijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guy thanks taking question twoparter kevin life year gain curious sensitivity advanced adenoma think blood base around curious life year gained differential would jeff adjusted ebitda margin look like guide implies basis point expansion year year little light think implies opex showing high single perhaps think go back longerterm model maybe little bit leverage expected curious conservatism opex assumptionskevin conroy chairman chief executive officer first question testing memory ranking cologuard best ratio screening test cologuard best ratio life year gained unnecessary colonoscopy colonoscopy highest life year gain simply assumption model also highest number unnecessary colonoscopy colonoscopy performed find anything majority colonoscopy fit test cologuard fit test done every single year way three people due fit test every year decade model way compared cologuard every three year fit test detects like maybe life year save life year cologuard inaudible blood fall like lack sensitivity refining precancerous polyp challenge would go back reread part script reread challenge getting b rated test hand b easily uspstf like great inflation yous college standard driven model precancer detection mattersjeff elliott chief financial chief operating
