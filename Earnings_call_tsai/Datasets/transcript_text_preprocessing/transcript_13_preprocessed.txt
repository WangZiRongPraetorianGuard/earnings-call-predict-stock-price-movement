look like first question come line quinn bolton needham company quinn please go aheadnic doyle needham company analyst hey guy nic doyle quinn bolton thanks taking question first expand million ad accrual additional accrual needed project additional radhard project looking come similar structure mean seems like main driver margin miss bunch tailwind like talked commentstom sonderman president chief executive officer yes start steve elaborate accounted essentially additional engineering work going required get one strategic ad program level performance required customer typical rd creating product parallel iterative process technology matured got point decided going take little bit engineering effort get program completed resulted additional charge steve elaborate accounted thatsteve manko chief financial officer sure accounting rule dealing contract government certain rule require u record accrual period identify additional cost needed program one case accounting principle applied contract best estimate right additional cost needed program accrual put balance sheet expense recognized completely quarter essentially happens opposed recognizing expense let u say next three four quarter pl come government accounting quarter recognizednic doyle needham company analyst ok make sense kind got pulled second question shape tool revenue next couple year mentioned threeyear pipeline million would higher estimate mean gave commentary around million year thinking tool revenue coming would make sense lower step back thought timing maybe risk pushouts thankstom sonderman president chief executive officer yeah mean think gave kind broad view think next three year math million close average threeyear period think good way model quarter tool arriving per plan sometimes coming sooner sometimes later planned think modeling purpose million probably good rate next three yearsnic doyle needham company analyst like ask followup pushout mean driving push demand issue really supply chain thing taking longer expectedtom sonderman president chief executive officer yes supply chain literally get commitment customer tool arrive sometimes meet commitment sometimes slip little bit literally happened past quartersteve manko chief financial officer provide guidance mean look really one slight pushout quarter however time also saying clarity expect tool come course think gave overall pipeline think tool revenue next three year slight timing delay see anything systemically supply chain point time tool delivery come right quarter end slip week could impact quarter give general guide pipeline really look like one tool slightly miss coming quarter also visibility tool likely come otherwise said last quarter earnings callnic doyle needham company analyst thank youoperatorthank next question come line krish sankar td cowen krish please go aheadkrish sankar td cowen analyst yeah hi thanks taking question steve kind curious clearly revenue improving nicely gross margin lagging understand onetime cost kind curious think overall gross margin year relative last year remember right spoken past longterm gross margin target exiting still realistic questionssteve manko chief financial officer yeah sure gross margin standpoint mean really million also getting little bit tool cost flowing well really impact first quarter otherwise pretty much line thought cost would really would see incremental growth taking place going forward gave range thought gross margin would second quarter approximately given talked revenue side still good top line revenue growth course seeing right revenue mix change expectation revenue mix rest year would similar talked expectation second quarter yearkrish sankar td cowen analyst fair assume gross margin year versus last year tool revenuesteve manko chief financial officer yeah look margin margin likely would slightly look impact basis point said basispoint impact tool coming looking margin important way look gross profit line company margin impacted significantly amount tool revenue coming yeartom sonderman president chief executive officer clearly lower run rate wafer service legacy infineon platform going contribute gross margin dilution wellkrish sankar td cowen analyst got two quick question one tell u utilization rate minnesota frontend fab orlando backend fabtom sonderman president chief executive officer yeah quote utilization skywater talked past target utilization tend want run target utilization drive at business running minimum level utilization wafer service obviously tied macro environment talked using opportunity accelerate at program really focus company right kind deal macro reality whole semiconductor sector working way throughkrish sankar td cowen analyst got one final question thomas steve much frontend customer using florida backend fabtom sonderman president chief executive officer yeah asked utilization florida fab still at centric fab volume product really utilization quote far customer using facility multiple ad customer well commercial customer development fab announced january awarded million program dod stand fanout wafer packaging technology kicked january program ramp throughout year excited amd applaud effort moving type capability back yous expect see lot coming florida year unfolds technology putting fab nothing volume perspective pointkrish sankar td cowen analyst got got thanks tomtom sonderman president chief executive officer thanks krishoperatoroperator instruction next question come robert aguanno piper sandler robert please go aheadrobert aguanno piper sandler analyst hey guy quick strategic one first maybe walk longerterm outlook wafer service obviously business taking hit understand macro side thing asking number maybe kind longterm strategy thinking kind relative scale business sort qualitative thing might impact business going forward maybe positive waytom sonderman president chief executive officer yeah good question talked past j curve effect customer convert at wafer service year excited announce nautilus bio last quarter lumotive quarter expect another announcement coming soon conversion going immediately replace legacy volume obviously get infineon customer plan along use at business seed fab minnesota new technology new platform new product long long life cycle ahead working per plan obviously along way dealing macro environment semiconductor weakness certainly relates legacy program hopeful point business come back form focus really seeding fabs future technology rate come back somewhat control customer get product market get traction goal make sure scale ready scale definitely obviously ad space program also moving funnel preparing go production viable product necessarily high volume see get certainly second half decade going start seeing much robust wafer service business much better margin really carry business forward continue grow scale skywaterrobert aguanno piper sandler analyst great color thanks guy one margin kind expand earlier question way maybe quantify mix shift around wafer service versus at tool revenue basically asking something maybe put context around maybe decline guy seeing year yearsteve manko chief financial officer yeah believe forecasted expect revenue think prepared remark upper at revenue second quarter approximately million tool revenue range believe tom sonderman president chief executive officer million millionsteve manko chief financial officer million million wafer service see significant change mix revenue compared qrobert aguanno piper sandler analyst color around margin theretom sonderman president chief executive officer tool margin relatively would say similar wafer service marginsteve manko chief financial officer yeah see basically say margin somewhere tool depending tool sold tool different revenue size really margin would look back supplemental information see break tool revenue tool cost past couple year see whole goal tool side necessarily generate gross profit even though get slight gross profit really limit depreciation expense need raise capital toolsrobert aguanno piper sandler
