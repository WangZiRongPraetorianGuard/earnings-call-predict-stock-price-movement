consumer remains source strength economy labor market remains strikingly resilient rising income kept consumer debt servicing burden relatively low historical standard look customer see higher bank balance pandemic true across income level hand course inflation shrank real income almost two year high interest rate environment cost new borrowing gone every major asset class think margin effect stretch consumer financially whole would say consumer reasonably good shape relative pretty strong shape relative historical benchmark term capital one performance continue see settling consider believe capital one speak card issuer definitely seen think sort landing feel good credit point wanted make tax refund let u pull second tax refund something nobody know sure exactly behind seasonality think believe important driver seasonality bigger effect u player think cash refund play little bit bigger role collectively across customer base tax refund nearterm effect credit performance ryan referring guidance gave annual guidance number saying extrapolate near window see term delinquency delinquency roll rate would see chargeoffs chargeoffs tend higher first half year giving window higher part chargeoffs year saying settling looked like around level part basically saying includes assumption happens tax refund seasonality effect see government data tax refund lower later historical pattern affect nearterm credit performance actually often talk well month window basically chargeoffs start bubbling going roll rate bucket pretty much see chargeoffs going tax refund actually affect payment rate every bucket point near term actually lead bit higher chargeoff rate guided near window change view credit settled guidance year really given credit guidance year really saying seen credit settle wanted flag credit card business auto business credit continues strong seen thing like really improving delinquency wanted point near term relative seen term historical seasonality kind confirmed watch pattern tax refund coming lower later wanted flag effect affect nearterm number cited earlierryan nash goldman sachs analyst got maybe quick followup andrew guess given rich answer mean trajectory allowance seems like heard handful issuer talk u peak maybe even coming potentially ended prior year maybe talk think mean capital one given credit expectationsandrew young chief financial officer yeah sure ryan would like say perspective simple answer host thing going drive allowance least growth focusing coverage assuming others pointing first thing would highlight said talking point fourth quarter seasonal balance quickly pay first quarter therefore negligible coverage see every year coverage ratio quarter bit last quarter really result dynamic look coverage ratio largely line preceding quarter mean biggest driver look ahead projected loss rate saying number quarter delinquency best leading indicator every quarter going look next month reversion going take account range outcome uncertainty seen last quarter keeping coverage ratio flat note though even period projected loss future quarter lower today might indicate release otherwise could well see coverage ratio remains flat modestly declined incorporate uncertainty future projection allowance eventually projected loss lower flow allowance bring coverage ratio uncertainty become certain scenario would see decline point like going forecasting business actually going take account like said really need take factor uncertainty look ahead every quarter go reserving processjeff norris
