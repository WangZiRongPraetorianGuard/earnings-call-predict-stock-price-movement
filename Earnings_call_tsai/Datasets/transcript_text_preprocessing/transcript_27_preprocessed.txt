remarkable story medical advancement optical genome mapping played significant role referring first successful kidney transplant genetically modified pig human patient conducted massachusetts general hospital march th egenesis bionano customer ogm user provided kidney pig donor genetically edited using crisprcas technology remove harmful pig gene add certain human gene improve compatibility human also use gene editing inactivate porcine endogenous retrovirus pig donor eliminate risk infection human process creating cell eventually grew pig donor followed multiple step genetic modification eventually arrive cell used grow donor throughout process optical genome mapping used part regimen confirm desired gene edits place offtarget effect detected detected deleterious optical genome mapping used alternative gbanding karyotype analysis ability detect genome variation method commonly miss seeing growth biopharma customer group believe customer see tremendous value ogms utility development safe innovative therapy focus remains strengthening company longterm growth profile part ongoing evolution continuing execute cost saving strategic productivity initiative began may

efficiently raise capital allow u extend cash runway path profitability key update product portfolio believe drive growth include stratys system fully commercially available early feedback adopter positive shipping commercial production unit capacity meet expected demand expect announce later week series major advancement entire suite comprehensive analysis software tool cancer including version via software aienhanced capability cancer research second half year plan release improvement data analysis processing time stratys compute highperformance workstation developed collaboration nvidia addressing dna isolation bottleneck isotachophoresis technology ionic system acquired acquisition purigen biosystems placed precommercial system field optical genome mapping ionic system using newly developed itp cartridge isolation ultrahigh molecular weight dna fourth quarter recently added two customer site track full commercial release product third quarter objective assembling combination solution high throughput data collection stratys streamline analysis reporting via automated dna isolation ionic enable optical genome mapping scale routine use pleased announce congratulate dr alexander hoischen team radboud university medical center netherlands award research innovation board radboud umc grant euro translation optical genome mapping routine use academic medical center focus leukemia solid tumor constitutional genetic disease work leverage highthroughput endtoend workflow progress market development first quarter saw highest number optical genome mapping publication quarter history total publication compared number publication first quarter growth publication influence stakeholder view optical genome mapping prospective customer thirdparty payer medical society growth really outstanding clinical study streamlined based cost saving initiative focused primarily advancing heme trial publishing pre postnatal study data constitutional trial finally would like comment briefly application submitted american medical association category cpt code covering optical genome mapping understand application may reviewed cpt editorial panel meeting start tomorrow may eastern time application third one submitted optical genome mapping previous two cycle withdrawn prior editorial panel meeting view fact go front panel sign progress eagerly awaiting outcome published publicly june although understand meeting taking place public possible anyone register may able attend link register meeting listed ama association website looking ahead remain track meet goal installing ogm system end reflects anticipated saphyr stratys upgrade expect q revenue guidance range million million maintaining fullyear revenue guidance million million keep mind range take account financial impact discontinuing certain clinical service product part costreduction initiative closing excited progress made acknowledge challenge facing due current state capital market need continue great momentum built confident optical genome mapping ability transform field cytogenetics operator please go ahead open line question question answer operatorthank operator instruction first question sung ji nam scotiabank please go aheadsung ji nam scotiabank analyst hi thanks taking question curious stratys placement first quarter upgrade saphyr stratys first quarter erik talked capital spending constraint seeing kind split instrument sale versus reagent rental see ticking toward reagent rental side current environmenterik holmlin chief executive officer yeah thanks sung ji think u space feeling constraint around available funding quarter reagent rental edged capital sale think kind within normal range would expect slightly elevated attractive vehicle bring system something paying attention going forward think felt pressure reason optical genome mapping something really new unique deal getting done example first quarter second quarter work might see something creeping perhaps later year result current environment mindful recognize peer definitely seeing regard stratys uptake quarter yes several successful program involved stratys time really breaking stratys overall total number growth ogm system space see important going forward right breaking progress continues solid anecdotally think seen conversion yet several discussion expect probably something would drive number dynamic installed base growth going forward anecdotally think seen conversion yet incremental addition stratys either existing customer new customersung ji nam scotiabank analyst got helpful ionic purification system great see nice traction early access site curious think potential ramp platform expect go expect early adopter kind stratys customer purchasing stratys system well anticipate significant portion existing saphyr customer also adopt also could used outside ogm applicationserik holmlin chief executive officer yeah let take last question first ionic system available couple year actually even time technology inhouse acquisition purigen biosystems gone kind upgrade cycle instrument reagent consumables used application nucleic acid isolation dna rna variety sample type majority uptake utilization formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe sample customer using nucleic acid isolation prior sequencing like isotachophoresis produce really pure sample much cleaner data get typical columnbased method something see interesting product u source revenue going forward able current costconstrained environment really put direct dedicated salesperson offer independently ogm part sale rep offering customer regard adoption expecting around optical genome mapping generally speaking expect see adoption highervolume routine user would include saphyr existing site quite number site running hundred sample per year would benefit integrating ionic system workflow also expect stratys user obvious adopter isotachophoresis reason one cartridge isotachophoresis expect able run eight sample ultrahigh molecular weight dna isolation process completed matter hour take overnight nucleic acid ready labeled imaged actual isotachophoresis process incredibly rapid think going see highervolume user going adopt one driving consumables purchase futuresung ji nam scotiabank analyst great thank get back queueerik holmlin chief executive
