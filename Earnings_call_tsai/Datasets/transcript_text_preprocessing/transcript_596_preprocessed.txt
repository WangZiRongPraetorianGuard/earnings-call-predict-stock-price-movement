pas back operator question question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come line sean steuart td securitiessean steuart td cowen analyst thank good morning question corporate ppa environment give u perspective price term trended know upward trend specific contract signing trend pricing evolved tension relates contract duration know general trend toward longerterm contract interplay price term attain right nowconnor teskey chief executive officer good morning sean thanks question maybe come slightly different way answer question headon seeing result significant increase new electricity demand driven data center demand driven increased penetration ev driven electrification industrial process right far corporate offtake demand readytobuild project key location simply supply demand imbalance favor readytobuild project key location way show term pricing dynamic seeing number year able pas higher capex cost higher funding cost offtaker form higher ppa price preserving development margin therefore able continually service increased amount demand put project increased amount demand development return seeing previously even little bit higher today really robust supply demand dynamic seeing term pricing obviously depend respective power market thing like capex funding cost within respective market seeing increased demand ability preserve even perhaps marginally enhance development margin term contract duration one thing uncompromising year perception renewables last year came government feedin tariff increasingly onto corporate contract meant contract duration got shorter simply seeing seeing significant demand longterm corporate contract year obviously attractive u financed attractively deal high credit quality counterparties really bulk demand seeing todaysean steuart td cowen analyst thanks detail one followon respect data center know least yous location data center tends quite concentrated specific region expect evolve give perspective brookfields ability meet demand specific areasconnor teskey chief executive officer sean really astute question absolutely right demand significant equal place power need place service corporate demand load seeing number dynamic first foremost ability work counterparties potential colocate new data center near power generation built really strong relationship large corporate offtakers proactively work identify location either greenfield development prospecting look create development pipeline region service demand second point would make regard question opportunity service corporate demand really today something seeing future happening real time order service corporate demand simply capability capital actually need already large pipeline project strategy last year really coming fruition focused buying premium developer large development pipeline core market really ensure well positioned meet demand accelerated today pipeline valuable ground existing working development process meet demand near term opposed simply planning project three five seven year outsean steuart td cowen analyst great detail thanks connor get back queueoperatorour next question come line robert hope scotiabankrobert hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone want stick data center theme today excuse looking development pipeline contracting strategy like maybe add little bit color moved away know single asset group asset serve demand think opportunity set front know large developer large pipeline disproportionately benefit versus smaller developer know call increasing opportunity set know essence market share increaseconnor teskey chief executive officer sure good morning robin thanks question right dynamic going lead concentration certain region data center demand dynamic clear without question greatest concentration data center growth need power supply united state fortunate half development pipeline globally sits united state second thing highlight yes well individual project might signing contract support individual data center corporate counterparty backstop contract corporate holdco large tech company corporate guarantee know trilliondollarplus market cap company around world ringfenced counterparty credit individualized singular data center think really important dynamic understand take great comfort growing opportunity set continues expand literally best counterparties around worldthese individual asset large tech company counterparties question scale going play hand larger player think reason perhaps little bit nuanced would really focus two thing power demand required large tech company truly remarkable sometimes tough put magnitude context therefore large technology company looking secure power supply either work literally thousand individual small developer work smaller number large developer fortunate group even top list come group provide meet need large technology company scale others really move needle term deep bottlenecking future growth would point one point underestimated constructive market important thing counterparties project delivered delivered time developer walk away project know get equipment get knocked schedule supply chain shipping issue global capability ability push issue using operational capability arise ensures among reliable counterparties large tech company power delivered schedule would say completely underappreciated benefit large player u worst thing tech company power data center turn finding constructive term contract term working large reliable counterparties important thing reliability project delivered time reputation capability reinforcing enhancing year nowrobert hope scotiabank analyst appreciate maybe followup broadly current equity market know thinking allocating capital return kind skew development side buy side right seeing opportunity setconnor teskey chief executive officer certainly really seen particularly last call maybe four week q seen stabilization interest rate know rate going great part business real return business work whether interest rate everyone appreciate market uncertain rate seem like going perpetuity becomes tougher market people transact kind turn page new calendar year stability interest rate maybe land three threequarters maybe land going within pretty tight range constructive level industry result think year active transaction perspective investment side capital recycling side know uncertainty particularly latter half probably caused number people stand sideline early indication reduced uncertainty market people open business seeing sale process launched also seeing engagement term new growth opportunity term specifically seeing opportunity would say across spectrum public company still remain key focus even somewhat relief rally latter part year would say interest rate settling pretty good level buying operating asset development asset think would pretty balanced year going forwardrobert hope scotiabank analyst excellent thank youoperatorour next question come line rupert merer national bankrupert merer national bank financial analyst hi good morning everyone one followup data center ppas looking typically simple takeorpay contract element capacity requiredconnor teskey chief executive officer know know year takeorpay inflationlinked contract good one want large technology company increasingly looking green power solution use wind solar development pair either hydro battery storage would say typically premium incremental upside call year takeorpay inflationlinked contractsrupert merer national bank financial analyst ok great thank secondly looking production quarter came around lta seeing similar trend across peer group course wondering comment recent weather pattern anticipate going forward maybe thought lta assumptionsconnor teskey chief executive officer perfect thanks question maybe let u share shine little bit light really two different dynamic happening within lta one key differentiating factor brookfield renewable one thing really bedrock business large critical base baseload hydro well valuable relative wind solar hydrology slightly variable asset class term resource two thing would focus come hydro lta one monitor exceptionally closely constantly needing update financing transaction therefore ver period time yes variability little lta little lta longterm average bang even resource little little lta thing need overlayered dynamic resource lta hydro resource lta highvalue market versus lta say lowervalue market differing impact financial result well hydrology little bit variable consistent long term one point would reference business continues grow diversify importance hydro lta increasingly diluted time second component lta little bit structural showing little bit current result today obvious reason buy new business one thing often focus finding investment opportunity clear operational enhancement execute short medium term ownership often buy new business start slightly lta take business previous ownership execute business plan implement operational improvement business trend lta number gone period rapid growth last call month number today would let u say three five year ago great news identified within control see number trend lta execute repowering refurbishment equipment replacement identified underwriting moving much track increasingly play financial performance going forwardrupert merer national bank financial analyst looking second component overall shortfall lta much result curtailment see quite significant curtailment wind power market course something controlled degree addition battery maybe new transmission line significant component shortfall youconnor teskey chief executive officer would say specific figure provide without doubt significant component discount lta one resource variability secondly specific identified operational improvement pushing asset curtailment course exist business would say material driver lta result well hope answer question perhaps one thing would add commented battery increasingly implementation storage strong dynamic seeing business particular addition battery increasing proportion new development activity seeing lo risk attractive return riskadjusted return way enhance number asset either recently acquired developingrupert merer national bank financial analyst great thank color leave thereoperatorour next question come line mark jarvi cibcmark jarvi cibc world market analyst thanks everyone maybe connor building comment around interest rate stability sort opening market little bit would frame interest competitive dynamic around larger asset portfolio six month ago think number guess potential interested party increased last couple monthsconnor teskey chief executive officer would say stabilization interest rate absolutely increased number interested party question would say really seen fairly dramatic shift beginning february end january compare market today versus say end september four month ago night day term level activity amount interested party buy side sell side maybe added point color would make tie back answer one previous question really saw number business saw headwind thought could largely attributed one two thing took significant basis risk development activity know higher capex level increasing capex level higher funding cost really caught short really disrupted negatively impacted number developer around world particularly offshore space one dynamic key headwind dynamic simply higher interest rate materially impacted business reliant know unfettered access capital market cheap financing business relied sort funding structure know suffered last year economic environment two dynamic seen little bit relief last call two three month clear dynamic gone completely away returned yet think return almostzero interest rate unlimited access capital three four year ago business model still work need either capital operating partner get back stable footing activity market would say also still relatively robust investment opportunity setmark jarvi cibc world market analyst ok couple followup maybe mean like opportunity deep transaction readily available valuation today guess flip side market condition inform guess pace type asset considering capital recycling connor teskey chief executive officer yeah great question would say comment made stand everything would say vastly applicable transaction like duke transaction bank transaction essentially bilateral deal significant scale offered something essentially participant market could people active market today still large opportunity set u bilateral deal either transaction structure operating capability bring scale provide relatively unmatched know many transaction competition today yes seeing inability bilateral transaction done past notmark jarvi cibc world market analyst maybe asset sale term pace know potential asset sale year versus last year think acceleratesconnor teskey chief executive officer hundred percent sorry forgot answer second part question absolutely seen really strong demand start seem still lot capital flowing sector capital maybe took pause couple quarter uncertain interest rate environment taken long capital come back would expect relatively active capital recycling side term see activity strategy always executed unemotional term geography asset class technology look opportunity sell asset greater value see holding portfolio term dollar might would say given relative dispersion portfolio today largely north america western europe surely concentration probably would see greatest amount asset recyclingmark jarvi cibc world market analyst ok maybe sneak one recent sort update guy positive turn around maybe stepping larger offshore wind investment still something really active kind change term likelihood making know larger play offshore wind sometime connor teskey chief executive officer sure approach offshore wind quickly restate love technology large fastgrowing mature quite frankly differentiated load pattern provide onshore wind onshore solar actually critical many power market around world struggled past investment profile basis risk take investor developer sometimes invest hundred million billion dollar upfront right build project four five six year time period lag market condition could could shift go obviously today number market participant seen headwind maybe need get offshore wind project maybe offshore wind project lot closer construction lot closer coming online therefore le basis risk aversion would say much active reviewing opportunity offshore space today would would couple year ago like anything compare opportunity riskadjusted return see elsewhere allocate best onesmark jarvi cibc world market analyst understood thanks time todayoperatorour next question come line nelson ng rbc capital marketsnelson ng rbc capital market analyst great thanks good morning everyone question development pipeline obviously highlighted lot opportunity yous looking development pipeline south america pretty thin think wind utilityscale project advanced stage wondering lack opportunity mainly focused developing north america europe momentconnor teskey chief executive officer hi hi good question relatively easy answer obviously vast majority development activity traditionally south america brazil last year would say successful developing large attractive project market know power price brazil due strong concentration hydroelectric generation across grid dependent hydrology level went back would say two four two five year ago hydrology level across brazilian system relatively low supported higher power price made wind solar development attractive market developed many large project come online scheduled come online since happened would say last month hydrology dramatically improved brazil across system push power price today low historical level obviously business brazil almost contracted exposed lower power price make difficult find new wind solar project secure contract price environment still developed attractive level shortterm dynamic wind solar growth brazil recover robust driven relatively large shift hydrology level changed market price simply period time development activity market going reduced simply tough secure contract attractive enough level justify capexnelson ng rbc capital market analyst really good color connor glad getting water bad yeah slows development next question obviously commissioned gigawatts growing think gigawatts next two year know target roughly deploying call billion per year average billion roughly portion going developmentconnor teskey chief executive officer yeah sure would say going next couple year approximately third give take already kind identified organic growth opportunity number could could prove little bit light would say thirdnelson ng rbc capital market analyst ok one last question noticed also involved solar panel manufacturing degree look like gigawatts gigawatts next year like selfsupplying development hedge cost look involvement solar panel manufacturingconnor teskey chief executive officer sure probably easiest way answer question let u talk exposure today well approach going forward exposure today solar panel manufacturing part structured large structured investment made company called avaada energy india avaada energy one largest independent renewable power owneroperators developer vast majority bulk business addition largescale owner developer renewable power also two business line one solar panel manufacturing two also early stage green hydrogen production india exposure space avaada made downsideprotected structured investment fund growth across three vertical vast majority business today would say relatively fairway leading renewable power developer india term good relationship avaada would happily use solar panel running producing investment exposure would say modest relative global procurement need well exposure today seeing around world trend toward scaling supply chain renewable power decarbonization solution could see future look investor scaling supply chain attractive riskadjusted return basis investment profile comfortable essentially mean would investment backstopped longterm takeorpay offtake contract similar look build new solar plant build new wind farm would rule investing supply chain future investment profile commensurate typically target mean would backed longterm offtake contractsnelson ng rbc capital market analyst great color leave thanks connoroperatorour next question come line david quezada raymond jamesdavid quezada raymond james analyst thanks morning everyone maybe first one comment release around inbounds gotten inbound call since origin deal announced curious color provide kind opportunity see maybe term nature deal geographical location scale opportunity color thatconnor teskey chief executive officer sure would say well outcome origin vote disappointing going process highly public nature really demonstrated one business plan willing sign also operating capability capital commitment would throw behind one largescale business transformation power transformation opportunity thing think demonstrated throughout origin well yes represent buying perhaps different initial business buy pureplay renewables developer became clear explanation business plan really predicated exact thing everywhere else around world predicated leading highquality bestinclass renewable power developer within different company business construct think illustrative illuminating market received inbounds would say inbounds across north america south america europe australia since announcement origin one point would highlight however david large strategic decision company make really changing trajectory business know largescale capex program transition business leading business market le carbonintensive derisked valuable business strategy multiyear period therefore type transaction happen overnight involve longterm courtship period education process working company transaction agreed upon come fruition number conversation today would suggest excited tend longerleadtime dealsdavid quezada raymond james analyst excellent thanks conor maybe one quick thought mean know certainly sound like pipeline alive well know stabilizing rate environment thing better curious think guess uncertainty around yous election could affect thing year go maybe uncertainty around happens tax creditsconnor teskey chief executive officer yeah certainly great question revert back point think really critical lose sight tie bunch major theme discussing today call today energy energy transition decarbonization renewable power development undoubtedly driven corporate demand far far far government push therefore politics role play way going disrupt rapid growth current trend line investment opportunity sector however think important know respond rhetoric headline market today depending might happen yous election think two important thing highlight one ira today vast majority ira fund going republican state may change bill different leadership would expect change dramatically second thing highlight fantastic current situation united state seen happens renewables growth republican democratic leadership recent year even going back republican leadership united state one fastestgrowing period renewable power country think reiterate government policy effect thing trend line corporate demand going set pace growth industry government policy simply going put little bit ebb flow around trend line certainly going wildly change approach market strategydavid quezada raymond james analyst great color appreciate turn thank youoperatorour next question come line ben pham bmoben pham bmo capital market analyst hi thank good morning wanted continue topic corporate versus asset acquisition curious think corporate deal brookfield renewable historically even think going forward think main benefit specifically corporate transaction especially talk maybe long drawn process courtshipconnor teskey chief executive officer yeah certainly ben great question two three thing would highlight particular environment much differentiate using scale operating capability corporates essentially picking partner help transition new business model going sustainable valuable decade come want pick partner credible without bestinclass capability think environment type deal bilateral basis really differentiated therefore hopefully target attractive return capital thing important highlight dissimilar seen call power transformation business transformation opportunity underappreciated benefit deal often large leading corporates many market operate result often attractive embedded infrastructure within business utilize make invested capital renewables buildout transition initiative either derisked done higher return business often leading built year decade underlying infrastructure sometimes underappreciated benefit transactionsben pham bmo capital market analyst interesting maybe second last one distribution quite solid environment make seem like question around strong curious think relative growth rate plus guidance reconcile thatconnor teskey chief executive officer absolutely remain committed increasing distribution within annual increase range market year decision around set within range always dictated drive best return capital simply seeing much growth seen much growth industry sector quite frankly within company specifically organic pipeline pipeline low end range simply seeing attractive opportunity deploy capital aggressively growth obviously long way away making decision year come trend quite consistent number year doubt played big role set distribution increase yearben pham bmo capital market analyst ok understood thank youoperatorour next question come line joe nussbaum bnp paribasmoses sutton exane bnp paribas analyst hi moses bnp think contracted versus spot power price going forward percent move would see decrease increase realized price hedge play roleconnor teskey chief executive officer yeah certainly business outside hydro facility north essentially united state colombia essentially contracted business continue believe riskadjusted return get fully contracting wind solar pipeline new development attractive financing get contract stability provides growth earnings attractive thing therefore remain committed building spec building secured longterm contracted revenue offtake question know contract profile would say almost always look way today little bit higher near term kind fading call percentage point next five year largely hydro portfolio modest component merchant protect variability resource simply contract rolling next two three year would simply look recontact point would say know essentially contracted current year kind tailing percentage point fiveyear forecast would say profile largely going stay keep rolling forward time pass anything might go little bit power price environment today far constructive last three five year might enter longterm contract hydro portfolio otherwise would say say profile largely going stay even time pass roll forwardmoses sutton exane bnp paribas analyst got ok make lot sense guess one upfinancing completed million think million recent expectation due lta performance performance versus lta think lumpyconnor teskey chief executive officer perhaps start maybe wyatt jump missed anything would say certainly anything lta performance even come discussion always looking use excess leverage capacity within portfolio mean raise liquidity attractive rate reinvest growth accretive manner look opportunistic basis time going forward great example tapped mtn market january securing year term debt attractive rate attractive opening market would say nothing specific around timing upfinancings wyatt hand anything addwyatt hartley chief financial officer yeah moses look financing environment majority looking financing hydro asset financing environment continues robust probably even robust rate normalized really factor timing planning around funding need capacity previously mentioned additional million continues around u managing source us based growth pipeline really factor timing mentioned capacity fact environment gone better would made estimate around millionmoses sutton exane bnp paribas analyst helpful thanks againoperatorthats time qa today would like turn call back connor teskey closing
