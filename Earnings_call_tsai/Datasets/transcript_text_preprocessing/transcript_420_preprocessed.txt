line openarun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah good morning doug wanted first start increase longterm threeyear order guide raised billion billion wondering comment drove increase perhaps give u sense much expectation market share versus growing tam term subsea offshore fidsdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer sure good morning arun really combination clearly total market size increasing know ourthe share market continue enjoy increasing share due unique offering provide look seeing giving u much greater visibility durability cycle much greater confidence kind risk weight opportunity direct negotiation competitive tender stated prepared remark represents subsea business obviously much higher ability able properly risk weight opportunity see outlook slide provide market size market solid growing really privileged position humble honored position offer customer clear line sight improve subsea project economics unique offering term subsea architecture iepci offering reduces cycle time month deepwater project thus vastly improving economics privileged position one take lightly continue work really really hard deliver customer every dayarun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst great followup doug intrigued mero project award know announced bit earlier quarter wondering could talk little bit unique technology bringing table seems like application could open world new opportunity despite taking processing separation sea floor mentioned would perhaps reduce need surface term design facility subsides wondering maybe comment technology perhaps scope future opportunity could open ftidoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer sure thank question award announced earlier chance talk forum first opportunity excited pointed think itwe said really really unique industry well company think understanding said actual award enabled let u start highlight yes one bottleneck see greenfield development offshore market continues grow delivery fpso fpsos complicated certain number provider fpsos clearly becoming long pole tent term project cycle time approach ensuring deepwater economics remain privileged ie drove customer global capital spend really everything every way address cycle time well reducing risk delivering project ensuring delivered time example would fpso intriguing unit let u see complexity really top side configuration put top either separate water oil treat gas two separate case high co rich dense gas flow stream seabed many advantage one simplifying fpso therefore reducing risk becoming bottleneck term driving even improvement cycle time secondly obviously real estate sea floor could thing horizontally whereas ship pretty much constrained thing vertically sort vertical construction cost horizontal construction simplest term real estate play importantly economics acc project reducing greenhouse gas intensity separating co sea floor reinjecting subsurface never see atmosphere bottom ocean sea floor closed loop system separate co reinject co hence delivering much lower greenhouse gas intensity project also mentioned think important point firstever iepci unique commercial model integrated commercial model first time petrobras using model absolutely right done separation project past done boosting unique combination advanced separation first time co specifically well boosting reinjection putting together integrated system architecture something extremely proud excited working petrobras deliver abeing done premise design one build many point start open sort opportunity move forwardarun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst thanks doug turn backoperatoryour next question come line dave anderson barclays line opendave anderson barclays analyst great thanks good morning

want go go back probably year ago guy start introducing cycle kind ended thinkif memory serf think cycle kind ended really became really kind took maybe talk kind different today subsea processing versus ten year ago maybe cc part effective kind changing kind curious adoption today talked fpso seem recall kind whole kind point first place catch maybe catch nowdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer dave would disagree would say subsea processing market maybe underdelivered past blunt looking completely different application know greenhouse gas intensity cc open completely different dynamic term thinking around sanctioning project ok let u say add additional dimension one reason believe ai would call almost new market almost would put bucket subsea processing even though using many technology multiphase pump separation etc unique application secondly unique technology involved working petrobras since rd center subsea brazil give u unique ability work closely petrobras developing bringing technology life experience term system integration putting together entire package give u reason believe dave application going go back point one add dimension project sanctioning criterion believe make decisionmeans decision toward subseadave anderson barclays analyst saying take cost fpso well sort idea help kind lower overall development cost project sort intent heredoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer well cost importantly going build fpso basic top side fraction time take build one full gas processing plant top notthe time building haul building storage onloading offloading system time element topside configuration know often done different yard haul made multiple different yard brought together configured assembled building floating gas processing unit refinery broad sense much complex whole focus customer think proud going help improve economics focusing shortening cycle time real focus todaydave anderson barclays analyst ok thanks go back award kind two year outlook subsea award even essentially kind added billion order kind next year view curious term iepci award saying today number go next two year assuming – already working project mean kind confidence come know iepci award start early stage kind coming pile one question pricing evolving consolidated market starting show starting show bid sorry packed lot theredoug

technological step term going deeper gas indeed electrification generally thanksdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer mark laughing spot technology review chief technology officer day thing would add said one actually enables deeper electrified actually complementary electrification allow u go deeper talked electrification past term allowing u longer step out ability able transmit hydraulic fluid response time push friction pressure delay able get response hydraulic actuation versus electric actuation done quickly went certainly deeper electrification electrification enable deeper also aspect going deeper particularly think thing like flexible pipe design flexible pipe able work depth emerging basin developed take unique design technology working also beneficial move new

certainly le confidence anything even convictionscott gruber citi analyst appreciate thought year ask going come back subsea separation talk help u think content uplift sti putting separation reinjection seafloor imagine range based upon actually done seafloor content production stream kind reasonable range u think term content upliftdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer well way would view know billion dollar plus award classified right done somewhere else top side today fti top side know engineering construction work whatsoever think minimum taking functionality scope someone else putting scope fti putting sea floor kind one aspect would kind think term margin expansion say well scale well actually brownfield project greenfield project brownfield project seeing incremental billion dollar plus scope coming company result unique offering capability multiply every brownfield multiply pretty dramatic uplift right scott kind interesting thing alluded said

sale well therationalization done last month clearly expect offset higher relative earnings mix coming subsea maybe – maybe skipped free cash flow question let get back first appropriately noted part q inflow indeed come advancenot necessarily advance offset milestone progress payment subsea business necessarily consider negative build contract liability considering positive actually run business neutral working capital basis whole company look forward certainly expect kind call build contract liability expect u continue neutral positiveslightly positive working capital next yearbertrand hodee
