operatorthank sir operator instruction take first question moses sutton bnp paribas moses sutton exane bnp paribas analyst hi thanks taking question congrats continued price momentum execution point see booking want say near zero given quarter mean simply book time pass naturally think investor kind think conversely eventually lower asp like range went way great see curious dynamic play year know could book expect precisely mark widmar chief executive officer yeah take one guess alex included remark mean plan patient opportunity see pipeline opportunity represent mid late obviously early stage pipeline separating u india going continue booking india clearly indicated got conversion happen contractor subject cp going continue cadence would expect call hundred megawatt maybe gigawatt particular quarter sell position see momentum continuing relates u strategy patient largely going engage market conversation customer happy booking showed last quarter great asp good counterparties technology adder associated fettered period time constructive u lot volume go touch even happy standpoint got short window next earnings call could see maybe period softness outside volume would expect continue recognize india got ongoing commercial conversation right north gigawatts booking shipment u latestage negotiation actually call ongoing got text booked reflected next earnings call momentum available u choose engage strategy try maintain asp deliver certainty provide customer lot going right step back reflect mean whole policy environment issue resolved uncertainty potential change administration dc alex highlighted well republican administration would choose engage kind conversation think ira think would le lenient chinese think get aggressive potential trade barrier customer concerned value certainty first solar looking derisk project far go thing still driving uncertainty marketplace seen recently ip standpoint especially market transitioned topcon jinko indicated strong ip position topcon going enforce ip seen maxeon make statement well got ip position around topcon also going enforce know significant transition toward topcon customer also think freedom operate counterparties around intellectual property lot think lot uncertainty outside engaging first solar disciplined measured negotiation would surprised finish year somewhere around booktobill gigawatts shipment profile would surprised booking somewhat zip code largely would fill pocket opportunity could exit year comfortable backlog right potentially solid position going continuing think book end decadeoperatorwell take next question philip shen roth capital partnersphilip shen roth mkm analyst hey guy thanks taking question first one pricing great job recent booking asp almost talk dynamic influencing pricing mentioned bunch earlier mark would love get feel customer conversation inflected last year much oversupply kind price decline environment recently lot policy activity kind swung back favor relates greater uflpa enforcement potential two one bifacial exemption removed talk customer conversation may inflected recently also expect pricing momentum remain steady even potential could go higher think risk could go lower second question module volume talked customer take delivery megawatt product check suggest could much gigawatts floating around many megawatt expect market transact secondary market know risk ultimately manage level customer ultimately deal protection something initiated understand better well thanks markmark widmar chief executive officer yeah start second one go back first one look megawatt think almost oneoff transaction think booked two three year ago sure exact time frame specifically stated prepared remark corporate customer basically going use selfgeneration selfconsumption right ultimately looking potentially potentially leverage beyond raw form electricity generation would provide customer gone financial distress challenge deal megawatt obligation customer enforce right contract also work customer recontract opportunity available u obligation take delivery pay particular project project cited state permitting believe interconnection project asset marketed right see successful extent transaction happen module go along assignment given consent support type consent spirit enforcing right underneath contract one issue phil question know asked couple time market product secondary market customer challenged right development standpoint relates interconnection addition something well aware contract customer aware fact need take delivery module talking hundred megawatt lot volume option find warehouse put warehouse potentially could look try transact third party try find right possible outcome customer always worked spirit let u figure solution work aware believe significant impact ability continue book volume may available given scheduled movement type thing keep eye also want make sure one deal talked unique circumstance necessarily reflective maybe opportunity hearing marketplace relates pricing asp momentum policy clearly toggle back forth trend right think lot uncertainty standpoint thing want continue try emphasize value certainty first solar value relationship value proposition conversation one largest partner last week could happier partnering first solar attribute talking strength technology certainty first solar also get responsible solar aspect well carbon footprint water usage energy payback circular economy inherent value proposition selling contracted offtake customer like data center value well work around economic impact different mean creating american job mean closely tethered supporting investing back america american manufacturing american technology play strength yes policy environment helpful right attribute almost equally important partner said basically look know may pay little bit first solar look brand certainty value proposition creating happy counterparty almost plus percent solesourced first solar got deep relationship multigigawatts opportunity still front u see unique oneoff generally engagement conversation customersalex bradley chief financial officer mentioned pricing would stay steady definitely elasticity demand related pricing want disciplined position strength put important need go chase deal mentioned call could book nothing end year still find two year forward sold uncertainty market afford step back therefore manage degree price erosion continue work people value attribute mark brings therefore think see lower pace booking pricing find acceptable long term clearly wanted sell lot drop pricing would happen strategymark widmar chief executive officer yeah think tether back look
