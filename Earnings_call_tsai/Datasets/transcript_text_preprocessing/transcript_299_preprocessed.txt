compare two way first expect recognize close zero revenue unused atlas commitment fiscal compared million fiscal may recall fiscal changed sale incentive structure reduce importance upfront commitment saw far fewer upfront commitment therefore fiscal deal come renewal fiscal expect see limited revenue related unused commitment second fiscal recognized approximately million multiyear license revenue fiscal know fiscal year nonatlas revenue benefited higherthanusual amount license revenue related multiyear contract including extended partnership alibaba clearly pleased fiscal performance unusual term magnitude multiyear deal expect similar performance fiscal result expect nonatlas revenue modestly fiscal next expect atlas consumption growth line consumption growth experienced fiscal finally want provide context better understand operating margin guidance plus million dollar fiscal revenue repeat fiscal high margin making exceptionally tough operating margin compare addition mentioned past fiscal began increasing pace hiring relatively late year full cost investment impact fiscal operating margin expecting headcount growth midteens versus growth fiscal dev mentioned prioritizing growth sale productive capacity consequently expect see yearoveryear operating margin decline still delivering basis point margin expansion twoyear basis believe appropriate way understand continued margin progression moving q guidance thing keep mind first expect atlas revenue flat slightly sequentially q two fewer day q year represents revenue headwind also slower atlas consumption growth holiday bigger impact q revenue q thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth finally sequential impact expected decline unused atlas commitment pronounced q given made change q last year second expect see meaningful sequential decline ea revenue discussed past year q seasonally highest quarter term ea renewal base excellent indicator ability win new ea business q ea renewal base sequentially much lower finally expect operating income decline sequentially due lower revenue well increased pace hiring summarize long delivered strong fourth quarter result pleased ability win new business see stable consumption trend atlas remain incredibly excited opportunity ahead continue invest responsibly maximize longterm value would like open question operator question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come line sanjit singh morgan stanley line opensanjit singh morgan stanley analyst thank taking question michael wanted walk guidance little bit know time last year coming know q think pretty different environment much cautious environment think usage growth particularly impacted atlas last year year coming fiscal year thing feel little bit healthier least stable sort guy framing yet guidance initial guidance growth look lot like initial guidance growth last year trying understand know talked onetime impact last year term better spending environment versus initial guide look also pretty similar last year could sort frame like conservatism embedded guidancemichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah couple thing thanks question yeah think key thing adjust onetime item called see stable environment described experiencing q compared q feel good think underscore million revenue repeat unused commitment well multiyear deal adjust know feel good dynamic question sort embedded around know sort call know guidance approach approach guidance know changed view relates guidance seen stable consumption obviously give u higher confidence part given le variability seen course fiscal think also better understanding underlying seasonality business updated end last year call q call around success ea updated ea new business assumption guidance reflects continued strength think approach fundamental change hopefully given fair amount piece part people help mathsanjit singh morgan stanley analyst yeah really appreciate thank breaking million unused commitment multiyear term license deal unused commitment side house million give u sense like flowed balance year obviously look like came q prior year q also mentioned million impact atlas revenue quarter impact know worse better year think unused commitment contribution quarter atlas resultsmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah think key thing million happen course year obviously attracts know actual contract affect relatively know small number customer small percentage commitment dynamic go away time discussed particularly called sequential basis obvious pronounced q know basically hitting first wave renewal commits especially people trying sequential math wanted call make sure people sort understood dynamicsanjit singh morgan stanley analyst understood congrats qmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer thanksoperatorthank one moment please next raimo lenschow barclays line openraimo lenschow barclays analyst thank congrats nice q question also little bit guidance mike last two quarter q talked ea seeing little bit tailwind customer kind maybe modernizing premise rather going atlas kind still modernize maybe spending money go cloud trend still valid think multiyear commitment obviously know million million alibaba deal stuff like customer work think change people go back like shorter commitment kind thinking renewal pool thank youmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah different thing embedded multiyear always dynamic seen know deal variability tried call sort call given asc increased variability reduced comparability come ea obviously atlas grown percentage business know continues dynamic ea portion expect continue see multiyear deal fiscal many thought point ea broadly nonatlas know something repeat fiscal wanted call quantified first part question modernization way would think know customer strategy including deployment including cloud posture thing like know decide want make mongodb easy consume run anywhere strategy proven know successful seen ea outperformance know think thing would add increasingly seen people appreciate even operating business maybe regulated environment fully move cloud want start modernize application modernize infrastructure mongodb seen enterprise advanced seen onramp cloud even fully modernize put public cloud setting ea help eventually given run anywhere strategy make easier ultimate move cloud wind doingraimo lenschow barclays analyst ok perfect thank youoperatoroperator instruction one moment next question next question come line kash rangan goldman sachs line openkash rangan goldman sachs analyst thank much congrats result one quick one dev one hopefully quick one michael well dev talked generative ai application described threelayer architecture think hit sweet spot mongodb positioned timing standpoint generative ai application start really drive underlying need kind database best suited one michael assumption take away million upfront mean like couple percentage point growth trying understand kind consumption trend using build guidance average fiscal consumption trend weighted toward second half exiting fourth quarter color would tremendously useful also want ensure sale force still selling ea get comp ea look like paying much weight ea forecast thank youdev ittycheria president chief executive officer thanks kash take first question regard see enterprise deploying apps production think combination customer getting comfortable technology also technology maturing performance cost point view know played chatgpt chat bot large language model know performance application get response time one two three second depending type question asking know naturally chat bot simple easytounderstand use case embed technology sophisticated application making realtime decision based realtime data performance degree cost architecture still also customer still learning phase experimenting prototyping would say seeing lot customer really deploy ai application scale think going take would say year year going know probably roll application learn know get experience become comfortable rolling application get technology mature cost come feel good positioning architecture point view document model flexible schema ability handle realtime data performance scale unified platform ability handle data metadata vector data query language semantics etc something make u attractive thing finding unlike typical sale someone deciding either build new workload monetize workload ai decision centralized decision ever allows u actually go higher organization actually engaging customer much senior level obviously coming topdown initiative allows u position u modern platform designed new modern use case workload feel good positioning said year think going know continued experimentation rollout individual applicationsmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer consumption question kash thanks overall look guidance piece part tried share take account million impact unused commitment multiyear outperformance see topline level around basis point headwind also walked expectation nonatlas modestly given million know part recurring kind piece together wind know probably coming conclusion atlas look know consistent consumption growth standpoint line stable trend seen course fiscal using fiscal number obviously seasonal adjustment factored really seeing last part question around ea know still sell ea tend sell ea new account tends existing account expanding mongodb footprint seller get compensated ea know part go back comment earlier question sale rep really dictate deployment environment customer yes get paid comment sort know ea result expectation really result difficult compare know part given multiyear dynamicoperatorthank one moment please next question come brent bracelin piper sandler line openbrent bracelin piper sandler analyst good afternoon thank michael going stick guide scene look last year guided think growth ended full year even take million tailwind talked still growth guiding growth year headwind closer organically confident kind going year last year think trend comparable initial guide last year really like adjusted basis comparing know little confusing getting lot question thanksmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah fine go back said response sanjits question know fundamental change approach term know looking determining know guidance think confidence point think correct confidence data know think back year ago one question indicated much macro uncertainty think course fiscal saw narrower variability saw consistent result give u increased confidence think also another year belt term understanding seasonality trend atlas know atlas big business still relatively young one especially think getting quarterly data point think confidence better handle lastly difficult compare ea think know talked second half last year know point could continue surprised ea much looked think third quarter call talked know upping view ea could sort baked guidebrent bracelin piper sandler analyst helpful color dev think milliondollar question think ai tailwind interest vector start really impact business sounded like think another see another year experimentation see big production move right take walk u current thinking ai really start show business thanksdev ittycheria president chief executive officer yeah think going show business people deploying ai apps scale right think going least another year said see really interesting startup building top mongodb give u confidence know platform fit sophisticated workload given noise around ai remember know still early day performance system would classify ok great cost inference quite expensive people quite careful type application deploy debate know open versus close source llm use use case specific llm general purpose llm lot learning going obviously know announcement today yet another company delivered better performance gpt people know lot going space people really get comfortable picking stack deploying know workload math going take bit time know obviously outlier obviously far aggressive essentially see across customer base good news feel like wellpositioned feel people really resonate unified platform know one way handle data metadata vector data open composable integrate different llm integrate different embedding model essentially also integrate emerging application framework developer want use think wellpositioned see u continue expand broaden reach category think going take little bit timebrent bracelin piper sandler analyst make sense thank youoperatorthank one moment please next question come line karl keirstead ubs line openkarl keirstead ubs analyst ok great maybe one dev one mike dev first question follows go first certainly voice industry would argue even advance ai application deployed scale said might take year enterprise might look spend modernize existing data stack data readiness advance ai apps going production seeing type behavior could proceed inproduction deployment timeframedev ittycheria president chief executive officer yeah touched little bit relational migration mean one way lot people feel like lot data trapped legacy platform shared know always customer migrate legacy sql apps mongodb hardest part basically rewriting application generative ai essentially lower cost running bunch pilot customer customer aligned access clevel decision maker know learning lot obviously learning effectiveness ai technology learning handle know old language old library old package different version know variability make clear require mix product service product alone today solve problem think know big opportunity early day said past even know talked investor preai big red easy button press kind migrate sql app mongodb gen ai make easier still going take little bit time definitely exciting lot customer leaning know excited option lot work dokarl keirstead ubs analyst yep ok thanks dev mike mike could trying set model quarter fiscal way descriptive million sum two piece know track quarter particular much million landed fourth quarter reportedmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah quarterly breakdown guess would offer know throughout life public company including three prior quarter year unusual trend tried call people could understand driving result looking forward would impact compare know think historic comment leave pretty good bread crumb trail know relative thing think clear multiyear deal ea outperformance happened needed sort rule thumb know credit would typically unused credit unused commitment would typically know map renewal cycle called seasonality know relates would probably big thing ea nonatlas know obviously q last year big quarter talked know alibaba deal hit q think know would divide four difference quarter quarter lastly call folk look business sequential basis impact atlas atlas number q given much pronounced effect given first quarter see impact changekarl keirstead ubs analyst ok awesome thanks lotoperatorinaudibleunknown speaker hello guy hear line coming bit dev ittycheria president chief executive officer yes hear unfortunately hear moderator hear youunknown speaker terrific ok well thank would like ask atlas stream processing announced june guess remind u like mongo reason win segment market idea product likely go gadev ittycheria president chief executive officer yes announced said announced private preview stream processing ended hundred development team use product public preview customer interested actually start using product today position win well couple reason one purely focused developer market data mainly json requires flexible schema realtime application given thing kind know coordinating feel really wellpositioned alternative rigid fixed schema variability data coming kind event becomes much problematic customer manage feel good position term timing going go ga candidly getting feedback responding feedback want sure addressed know kind lowhanging fruit go generally available really excited opportunity stream processing offer usunknown speaker might ask little followon add kind proper second question followon stream processing embedded guidance fiscal question bottom line guidance mistaken op margin fiscal assuming beat guy year six point beat would put u point op margin exiting fiscal kind netnet flat year year due kind putting kind foot gas term hiring really trying aggressive adding headcount thank youmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah couple different question let try get obviously plan related stream processing know included guidance know show atlas overall think result certainly whether know new workload anything else tend start small grow quickly first couple quarter would think major needle mover context fiscal result excited long term term op margin yes guidance go backwards operating margin relative fiscal result basis point improvement twoyear basis thinking rationale related fact take step back look u relative ipo mapped needing around point margin improvement get target margin fiscal result effectively delivered point yet still market share make sense continue investing opportunity particularly sale productive capacity talked also execute product roadmap continue take u backwards relative last year positive basis point twoyear basisunknown speaker tremendous thank muchoperatorthank one moment please next question come line brad sill bank america line openbrad sill bank america merrill lynch analyst oh great thank much wanted ask question around sale capacity sound like point last year realized underinvested maybe pivoted much toward margin expansion catching guidance could assume sale capacity would prefer point given demand seeing would higher level growth know trying parse much guide factoring know constraint sale capacity talked aboutdev ittycheria president chief executive officer yeah thanks question yes know given macro uncertainty especially coming know q last year know slow hiring quite meaningfully obviously showed number point michael talked op margin well know obviously know big opportunity front u growing headcount mid high teen think appropriate relative opportunity see yes productive sale capacity guidance would probably higher question thatmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah would brad would make sure clear slowing hiring really macrorelated sort concern environment think back broad scale layoff happening across industry everything else obviously successfully weathered storm think talked last call benefit hindsight result put quickly least u thing stabilized know could started investing sooner think yearago call talked adding singledigit headcount growth relative think headcount growth prior year wound adding know obviously high end would constitute single digit part stabilization see comment affect op income guide everything else backend loaded right investment much affect fiscal pl really reflecting intobrad sill bank america merrill lynch analyst understood thanks much one may please guy broad exposure different industry advent ai coming business early progress seeing vertical would point seeing activity perhaps others use case might point give u sense early adopter know might come thank youdev ittycheria president chief executive officer yeah regard use case seeing customer focus driving efficiency business know existing baseline cost wellknown much easier determine much value derive using new ai technology see first wave know application around reducing cost seen announcement customer saying know focusing thing like customer support customer service really found way dramatically reduce cost surprising think cogeneration increasing developer productivity another area think going kind two area lowhanging fruit think going see customer focus delivering better experience customer find new stream growth think common phase term across industry think obviously constraint customer based regulated nature industry general see basically high interest across almost every industry operate inbrad sill bank america merrill lynch analyst exciting thank much devdev ittycheria president chief executive officer thank youoperatorour next question come line rishi jaluria rbc capital line openrishi jaluria rbc capital market analyst wonderful hey dev hey michael thanks much taking question wanted first start relational migrator dev talk little bit demand look like customer talking focused around value prop around cost saving get moving legacy relational database mongodb flexibility around technology maybe could tie know expect gen ai accelerator impact timeline migrating workload relational mongodb got quick followup michaeldev ittycheria president chief executive officer sure talk customer remember even ipo meaningful number customer migrating relational mongodb tend come three category reason first data model become brittle relational architecture hard build new feature responsive customer feel like ability innovate slowed second reason system scaling performing given increased number user large amount data process realize get legacy platform third reason cost underlying platform relative roi application providing typically fall one three bucket sometimes customer may three maybe two three driving demand typically compelling event maybe milestone want hit maybe renewal coming incumbent vendor driving potentially move vendor quickly possible said relational migrator three part mapping schema know tabular relational schema documentbased schema mongodb actually moving data mapping new schema rewriting application done lot already pregen ai customer take know want rewrite everything customer take microservices basis start peeling functionality existing application move move functionality new application time really depends customer use case business need yes gen ai expect rewriting application become easier hence lower cost essentially switching definition expands amount customer workload go would say top three reason gave term people move emerging fourth reason enabling data application aienabled know moving modern platform making aienabled also something getting customer interest question timing said think year going see lot pilot people trying new ai capability think technology improves learn know think would scale much quickly thatrishi jaluria rbc capital market analyst wonderful really helpful michael quickly know put first free cash flow positive year public company history think margin guidance next year thinking cash conversion going forward thanksmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah think two factor think term cash conversion know within atlas dynamic know reducing continuing see know le upfront atlas obviously know hitting anniversary creating headwind revenue front tough compare atlas revenue assume atlas going increase percent revenue think sort drive divergence big delta thing related sbc stuff like think atlas dynamic think know potential change cash conversion standpoint think would focus impact assume atlas going larger percentage businessrishi jaluria rbc capital market analyst right helpful thank

yearsdev ittycheria president chief executive officer yeah first committed mongodb excited opportunity plan go anywhere second regard snowflake databricks typically compete right focused analytical workload focused operational workload two different set use case big difference term customer buy typically data warehouse data lake tends centralized decision organization standardized one platform basically move existing data platform would say know operational platform tend decentralized decision different development team different line business etc based requirement application choose make

high last year considering really heard since q last year called several million overage credit guess frame u consistent seen prior year guess know obviously embedding continue next year change way know recognizing overage revenue expect happen contract reset thank youmichael gordon chief operating officer chief financial officer yeah two quick thing interest time reminder several incremental
