executive officer thank mike see slide excited innovation growth strategy phase clinical trial multiple myeloma endometrial cancer myelofibrosis would transformative patient organization mentioned start call believe largest opportunity selinexor yet come data expected three phase trial next year going incredibly exciting time organization focused delivering next phase growth people continue strive day patient high unmet need working generate value patient shareholder thank joining u today would like ask operator open call qa portion today call operator question answer operatorthank lady gentleman begin questionandanswer session operator instruction one moment please first question first question come line peter lawson barclays line openpeter lawson barclays analyst great thanks much maybe question mike sohanya around way kind quantify community versus academic setting growth kind think look like exiting year richard paulson president chief executive officer yes thanks peter question look overall think sohanya talked prepared comment really need differentiate environment community setting academic setting turn sohanya elaborate looking sohanya cheng chief commercial officer thanks peter question take step back despite rapid evolution competitive landscape achieve total demand growth year year community setting area hyper focus u clear growth driver u another key accomplishment community u really broadened site care broad base prescribers increased prescriber base year year area want drive depth community largest contributor business twothirds business switching academic setting contributes third business see rapid evolution competitive landscape last year really eye storm especially second half year saw downward demand pressure result uptake bispecific class two three bispecifics launched second half last year move see couple new dynamic come play potential approval fourth bispecific potential shift cart earlier line however term defending business academic setting really around enabling flexible position selinexor novel mechanism easily combinable supported tcell fitness data allows u really play potential pre post tcell therapy space academic settingpeter lawson barclays analyst perfect thank impact bcma therapy think kind continues seen kind major shift already kind happenedsohanya cheng chief commercial officer yeah bispecifics touched really posed significant competitive threat academic setting particularly second half last year mentioned two three launched second half seen uptake community think going minimal impact near term community academic setting definitely saw impact real world seeing patient bispecifics eight nine month many progressing curable option think role selinexor relative bispecifics published data positive outcome post bcma failure really allows u position bispecific many case prebispecifics wellpeter lawson barclays analyst thank much jump back queuerichard paulson president chief executive officer thanks peteroperatorthank next question come line maury raycroft jefferies line openmaury raycroft jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks taking question going ask one two myelofibrosis wondering thought recent acquisition morphosys read throughs would karyopharm based regulatory process could play particularly tss endpoint key secondary coprimary endpoint could potentially conversation fda prior filing change study design need berichard paulson president chief executive officer thanks maury take first part turn reshma take second part think look novartis morphosys acquisition think really validates high unmet need myelofibrosis space really talk value opportunity myelofibrosis think strong validation value unmet need myelofibrosis turn reshma talk looking term evolution think really strong opportunity watch evolution space move forwardreshma rangwala chief medical officer yeah exactly thank question maury think presented today really outline strength across entire profile selinexor ruxolitinib specifically optimal spleen volume reduction symptom improvement right tss perspective also absolute tss looked individual domain seeing maximal effect across individual domain course underscored cytokine data really wealth growing sort data set around symptom score really suggests maximize benefit across endpoint let u forget disease modification course improvement stabilization cytopenia really emphasizing totality profile going optimal jakinaive patient population encouraged confident look symptom phase going show meaningful benefit compared selinexor alone richard mentioned think got best opportunity right ongoing phase currently enrolling know environment evolving physician perspective also fda perspective going capitalize opportunity evolve endpoint opportunity course incorporate study prior database lockmaury raycroft jefferies analyst ok helpful maybe one question plan report preliminary result monotherapy phase jakinaive myelofibrosis moderate thrombocytopenia second half year talk strategy study potential standalone monotherapy approval path supplementing combination filing aprilreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes great question one unique aspect selinexor look preclinical data obviously clinical data relapse refractory myelofibrosis study essential study course subgroup data phase selinexor plus ruxolitinib point intriguing monotherapy activity unique look mechanism mechanism action whether bet inhibitor bcl inhibitor agent large critical monotherapy activity key physician ultimately flexibility dosing want use phase study investigate monotherapy activity high unmet patient population opportunity read data later year really able identify whether activity meaningful high unmet need patient population really looking proofofconcept study potentially expand potentially get nccn right really double better test hypothesis selinexo jakinaive populationmaury raycroft jefferies analyst got ok thanks taking questionsrichard paulson president chief executive officer thanks mauryoperatorand next question come line jonathan chang leerink partner line openjonathan chang leerink partner
