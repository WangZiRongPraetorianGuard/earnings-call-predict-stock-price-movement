concludes prepared remark tim would like open call question question answer operatorladies gentleman time begin questionandanswer session operator instruction time pause momentarily assemble roster first question today come krish sankar td cowen please go ahead question krish sankar td cowen analyst yeah hi thanks taking question first one tim tim question high aspect ratio nand high market share said prepared comment defended market share competitor tokyo electron introduced cryo etch product year ago also one three year ago kind curious talk little bit market share dynamic high aspect ratio fact customer talking using cryo etch layer nand give u color high aspect ratio etch followup dougtim archer president chief executive officer sure krish cryo etch couple data point prepared remark one installed base cryo etch tool used nand approaching chamber obviously highvolume production application quite time comment always customer exploring different option development phase comment complex process put highvolume production continue leverage learning get working customer focus technology extension manufacturing readiness focus able defend decision come point customer really decide tool commit next fabrication line say working hard make sure best tool application far winning day krish sankar td cowen analyst got got good hear share still solid followup doug margin doug kind mentioned gross margin maybe moderation june quarter due customer mix mainly function china think gross margin second half maybe extend question think opex back half yeardoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah krish guess would say couple thing first gross margin sometimes little bit better selling smaller customer going pin one geographic region necessarily china smaller customer tend volume purchase pricing sometimes pay little bit geographic region size customer one thing think scripted remark well tim said think china region modulate little bit go year part need think talking couple quarter anyway mind updating model second talking think couple quarter maybe actually three quarter need grow rd investment year technology change see around backside power advanced packaging forth dry photoresist absolutely planning saw march quarter rd percent total spending highest seen intend keep investing rd independent whatever top line going grow rd investment yearkrish sankar td cowen analyst thanks tim thanks dougtim archer president chief executive officer thanks krishdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer thanks dougoperatorour next question come timothy arcuri ubs please go ahead question tim arcuri ubs analyst thanks lot wanted ask china going modulate year mix sound like still going year year domestic china year guess question seen headline entity potentially added entity list wondering comment reflect potential addition entity basically say hey status quo remains assumption meaning entity added would downside commentstim archer president chief executive officer yes tim mean obviously forecast change u trade policy respect china know basically giving best view think china business rest year recognizing could change foresee well say obviously built believe strong government affair team plugged relevant discussion think last couple year seen pretty strong track record working u government responding export control policy plan going futuretim arcuri ubs analyst sure thanks tim doug wanted ask service bit much different dynamic happening spare reliant business talk certainly sound mean kind odd situation would spare piece strong reliant piece weak sort give u readthroughs like mean future businessdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah listen think well understood right got two dynamic going relative thinking different component csbg first industry utilization starting get somewhat better would definitely say early day reason specifically talked spare level versus last couple year clearly beginning show spare business however look csbg total softness reliant also think pretty well understood industry right mature note investment outside china region certainly pretty soft right two competing dynamic going shown csbg line guessing tim right csbg probably flattish year last year two offsetting dynamic help think ittim arcuri ubs analyst perfecttim archer president chief executive officer think thing would add mean think csbg business little bit longer term mean clearly commented utilization starting tick move think also see significant upgrade activity coming back especially nand space talked fact large portion installed base yet moved toward technology node useful customer think also flow csbg business perhaps much year clearly move beyondtim arcuri ubs analyst thank timoperatorour next question come harlan sur jp morgan please go ahead question harlan sur jpmorgan chase company analyst good afternoon thanks taking question accelerated compute ai semiconductor segment market still seems lot constraint centered around high bandwidth memory tightness coop packaging obviously guy strong position mentioned tim guy previously talked business opportunity potentially like billion per year type revenue opportunity given strong demand pull expanding use case mean lam team already track drive billionplus advanced packaging revenue year trend place right kind new maybe revised view revenue opportunity team next year tim archer president chief executive officer yeah harlan think right strong pull mean obviously responding quickly demand advanced packaging shipment year billion kind important milestone u know give like next milestone obviously seeing tremendous growth demand area position strong said foundry logic side advanced packaging also talked specifically strong position hbm related packaging side hbm think area see good longterm growth investing area talked past work panel processing space trying look ahead see packaging market going go make sure fully capable taking advantage see real longterm secular driver semiconductor equipment industryharlan sur jpmorgan chase company analyst congratulation hitting milestone followup question customer spending outlook looking constructive psychodynamics continues improve got strong tailwind manufacturing complexity trend like growth outlook appears quite solid right team look beyond year ramp new malaysia manufacturing facility mean lowcost geography like guy mentioned got highly skilled workforce also set supply chain support infrastructure locally well know tim doug way think incremental gross margin benefit incremental revenue flow malaysia factory start load ittim archer president chief executive officer let take first part let doug talk specifically gross margin comment think one thing think feeling comfortable last question boy must lot demand got ramping think come next upcycle feel well positioned relative thing talked physical capacity trained workforce supply chain built made resilient since last big upturn industry saw lot constraint think standpoint feel really good executed operation side house need start seeing kind new peak volume demonstrate externally let doug address gross margin question doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yes harlan guess remind said prior quarter want run ahead financial model put still right way think obviously right got quite favorable customer mix expect continue know maybe wrong benefit malaysia came inflationary stuff whatnot completely intend get back gross margin better financial model maybe push little higher certainly going stop staying focused way think malaysia still future show ramp incremental volume ready thatharlan sur jpmorgan chase company analyst perfect thank youtim archer president chief executive officer thank harlanoperatorour next question come srini pajjuri raymond james please go ahead questionsrini pajjuri raymond james analyst doug think china side one clarification expecting china moderate quarter come better expected go back comment china moderation rest year particular segment within china mean dram logic add color would helpful doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yes srini came pretty much expected suggested last quarter going continue remain pretty good march pretty much expected know like segment level got specific color relative china slowing little bit second half broad set customer every segment dram foundry logic broad set look total see somewhat weighted early part year modulate somewhat nothing specific share segment standpoint srini pajjuri raymond james analyst thanks doug maybe tim tim large customer got pretty good amount subsidy government recently chip act stuff outside u well wondering sort impact expect term business guess money come guess thought timing potential order incremental funding getting thank youtim archer president chief executive officer yeah mean obviously seen even last week quite announcement chip act grant u also note similar chip act program going place like japan obviously little bit future europe elsewhere always said time frame equipment side especially shorter lead time tool like provide see fab coming lot construction activity see long lead time tool go know time come think still opportunity u important thing lot extra money maybe really exciting targeted toward truly leadingedge node one thing lam story focused lot rd investment build position leadingedge foundry logic next generation dram highbandwidth memory well course continuing strength nand see new fabs come mean additional spending node believe actually better sam market share perspective patiently waiting know going come go visit site fab building feverishly working get ready equipmentsrini pajjuri raymond james analyst thanks timtim archer president chief executive officer thanks srini operatorour next question come cj muse cantor fitzgerald please go ahead question cj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst yeah good afternoon thank taking question guess first question wanted try get little bit color updated wfe outlook look like taking billion talked really litho impacting guess infer still expecting wfe kind low midsingle digit part thinking four large driver particularly guess two three growth potential relative outperformance expect seedoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yes cj mean obviously one peer industry reported last week took look view missed little bit shipping china vast majority change wfe point view always moving piece dram may little stronger trailing etch foundry logic probably little bit softer end day biggest change saw missed little bit part addressable market sure caught second part question cj try one timecj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst think billionplus opportunity particularly around advanced packaging guess including hbm within also get around think fare relative wfe doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah think given mix see technology transition incrementally better last year surecj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst quick second question guess third question could sneak talked normalization china second half getting back maybe ish type normalized gross margin sound like china mind today better guess would number continues strong guy thank youdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer guess cj got kind look right absolutely right thanks mentioning sort gross margin done malaysia stuff china popped smaller customer fact level largely customer mix thinking mix wrong margin kind got couple data point last couple quarter kind solve understand might look like plus percent range depending mix look likecj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst thanks muchdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer thanks cjoperatorour next question come atif malik citi please go ahead question atif malik citi analyst hi thank taking question first one tim tim good see green shoot nand market talked doubledigit far part growth nand also talked ai storage inflection highdensity ssds front u x wafer per bit offset seeing dram side kind paint u trajectory nand improvement expecting second half next year doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer going give forecast quite yet way early better though right mean improving tim let tim archer president chief executive officer yeah well guess without giving exact number mean clearly know nand spending incredibly weak last month early stage starting see recover think look rely customer commentary make publicly lot talk fact maybe bit shipping leading edge look installed base system comment believe still going large portion installed base move forward next technology node efficient way customer upgrade already think see move forward therefore nand wfe move come large degree upgrade lam capture rate every dollar wfe spend much higher greenfield capacity added think lam opportunity outperform nand think obviously high confidence type spending would expect seen market segment also pretty high mentioned technology inflection occurring stayed around year actually billion shipment gate around technology node obviously gate around continues proliferate tool like ald selective etch better backside power delivery already talked advanced packaging obviously front u also work dry photoresist process euv feel like number growth driver company besides one obvious nand recovery atif malik citi analyst great thank one doug doug within china sale talked multinational picking came positive surprise talk driving customer worried incremental restriction trying upgrade older technologydoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer think responsive demand see relative capacity yes said highest level since mid last year although understand position vast majority spending china continues indigenous chinese customer base observed going number knowing everybody going asking china something thought would mentionedatif malik citi analyst thank youdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer thanksoperatorour next question come toshiya hari goldman sachs please go ahead questiontoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst hi guy thank much taking question wanted ask question nand well tim prepared remark talked transition tungsten molybdenum potentially happening market suppose next couple year speak significance term depth intensity could impact business next couple year thanks tim archer president chief executive officer sure well obviously time material change requires new system opportunity lam provide technology market important change mean call moly hard say molybdenum change moly significant device benefit also mentioned important thing nand mean important every element semiconductor device cost technology one thing sometimes lost part transition moly also enabling stack height reduction go layer limit stack height way allows productive etches productive deposition thing think important import inflection industry opportunity lam well positioned win inflection believe toshiya hari goldman sachs analyst got thank followup hbm talked business growing x year year think think comment consistent communicated last quarter based sort input market intel kind bit growth market growth hbm think increase business support obviously demand strong thinking supplydemand perspective exiting year hbm thank doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer toshiya maybe get try mean look overall bit demand hbm probably although growing adding broad market clearly requiring incremental investment sabre tool deep silicon etch tool think something going hear u talking many year come form factor going continue important relative ai enablement feeding gpu data need small today growing quite rapidlytoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst thanks muchtim archer president chief executive officer thanks toshiyadoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer thanks toshiyaoperatorour next question come joe moore morgan stanley please go ahead questionjoe moore morgan stanley analyst great thank wanted follow mentioned customer classifying nand others might classifying dram wanted doubleclick could talk going customer sort people different classification thinking nand capacity coming china thought talk changedoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer guess would say joe sometimes could little bit confusion felt talking people last quarter reason said actually nonvolatile device got nonvolatile component early put everything nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory nand enormous number big enough want people hear u tell go think probably know customer going disclose one customer specialty dramjoe moore morgan stanley analyst got thank reliant business talk change business sort move lower level utilization trailing edge node see kind returning refurbished tool business stuff able actually refurbish ramification think profitability tim archer president chief executive officer yeah guess comment would surprised move back toward customer divesting equipment fabs u able refurbish tool think could see obviously ebb flow demand many new tool ship think think still remains mostly new tool trailingedge node business usjoe moore morgan stanley analyst great thank youtim archer president chief executive officer thank joeoperatorour next question come stacy rasgon bernstein research please go ahead question stacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst hi guy thanks taking question doug wanted go back something mentioned around relative capital intensity upgrade versus greenfield investment nand get get idea take larger share upgrade thinking wrong would absolute amount wfe upgradedriven cycle lot lower greenfield cycle like think put take two variable context nand growth tim archer president chief executive officer sure stacy take actually one tim said need comment yes problem wanted case disagree think thinking exactly right mean reason upgrade attractive customer total wfe spend lower upgrade installed base comment specifically lam outperformance relative whatever wfe industry next year upgradeheavy cycle obviously last two year next cycle nand upgrade saying would capture higher percentage whatever wfe said past lam opportunity actually much higher capture rate different term revenue every bit added upgrade versus greenfield wfe come attractive customer lam capture almost amount revenue much higher capture rate kind go way stacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst indifferent like upgrade cycle versus greenfield cycletim archer president chief executive officer well would say thing would say lot question whether lam market share defense others quite indifferent power installed base customer preferred path upgrade already mean position change lam strong position carry forward case agnostic financial perspective obviously position industry continues strengthen upgrade cycle stacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst got got helpful followup wanted go back segment expectation china know think doug said anything tell u segment look slide deck slide unless reading wrong seem suggest see say sustained investment domestic china dram calendar weakness foundry logic actually expecting china degradation year foundry logic dram sustaining slide reading slide wrongdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah stacy kind one customer china dram got careful talking china going modulate year right going stay statement made going modulate every segment believe china region stacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst ok slide say expect led hbms sustained investment reference china dram going happen doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer unfortunately slide front right stacy technical challenge going model slide pull upstacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst ok thank guysdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah problemtim archer president chief executive officer thanks staceyoperatorour next question come vivek arya bank america security please go ahead question vivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks taking question wanted revisit comment spare doubling important data point like expecting instead versus actual result much increase confidence nand recovery really increasing wfe expectation year right surface comment spare doubling sound like important data point sure quite put context mean lam year tim archer president chief executive officer ok well first say spare would double said doubledigit percent growth quarter quarter spare revenue doubling think general mean way look made comment obviously positive u see spare move think go back commentary previously csbg last year said spare revenue grow year year installed base grows however downturn cut fab utilization severe actually saw spare revenue come surprised u bit maybe point expectation knew soon customer started utilize fabs bring tool back online would see spare increase said would first sign end market really starting improve reason called obviously confirms think hearing customer utilization starting improve tie wfe utilization one issue choose spend either upgrade technology add capacity second decision said likely still event equipment spend side get first indication utilization improvement spare improving rest would come vivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thing call believe doug mentioned csbg flat year year hear properly mean sequentially mean calendar year calendar year implies pretty strong kind midteens growth second half could clarify said csbg growth whatever time frame referring doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer yeah said flatish plus minus flat way new disclosure said last quarter well vivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst calendar year doug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer correct calendar year yeah vivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst got thank youdoug bettinger executive vice president chief financial officer thanks vivekoperatorour next question come chris caso wolfe research please go ahead question chris caso wolfe research analyst yes thank guess first question dram could perhaps talk moving part going right think previous question talked china part dram expecting moderate year obviously direct revenue hbm sound good broader capacity question going dram fungible hbm could talk expectation year progress tim archer president chief executive officer yeah let start think address one point fungibility capacity correct obviously looking ddr think made couple comment past though one talking specifically additional tool needed enable hbm talk electroplating syndion silicon etch tool added whatever capacity might dram need add tool make hbm possible seeing rise x year second side go conventional dram hbm customer talked industry talked much larger die size create real estate needed add tsvs may able translate dram equipment produce number bit need equipment well key driver moving additional spending growth move hbm dramchris caso wolfe research analyst got followup made prepared remark comment talking billion revenue gateallaround year could talk context overall opportunity gateallaround billion
