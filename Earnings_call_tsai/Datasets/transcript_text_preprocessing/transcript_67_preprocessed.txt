aware transport layer rag architecture believe standard yet point plan establish formalized reference architecture program rag implementation perhaps broader inference use case really aimed making confluent standard transport transformation welljay kreps cofounder chief executive officer yeah yeah focus u kind evangelizing architecture say something coming kind formation reality think great alternative realtime data movement right outside confluent would say kind strong status de facto realtime movement data across enterprise opportunity customer try build batch plenty batch gtl product reality though lot use case answering question business really good enough lot use case something customer supportrelated word driving aspect business kind answering data information likely wrong relative customer seeing real push toward real time yeah u make sure stack solidifies permanent position thathoward guggenheim partner analyst great maybe could slip one topic open source kafka conversion talk progress seeing confluent migration accelerator tool believe called increasing wallet share among fortune extent partner using tooljay kreps cofounder chief executive officer yeah

aheadpinjalim bora jpmorgan chase company analyst please answer jay kreps cofounder chief executive officer starting see yeah yeah mean goal open full set apis first thing launched sql intention bring java python apis well think serve different use case set kind core application probably always applicationoriented programming language like java set dynamic use case transformation well suited sql one powerful thing flink kind opening broad set tool top core engine think one thing made leader stream processing yeah goal much make easier easier use long time think case customer would prefer realtime data would rather work apps updated real time reacted real time would rather able connect thing real time nobody want data slow actually difficult making really easy kind core way enabling like obvious benefit make costly complicated customer see u kind focusing ease development tcooriented thing really kind core thing drive think huge opportunity whole set batch data movement batch processing really need move move alternative becomes appealing ease use tco pinjalim bora jpmorgan chase company analyst right thank youshane xie right thanks reminder confluent earnings report ir
