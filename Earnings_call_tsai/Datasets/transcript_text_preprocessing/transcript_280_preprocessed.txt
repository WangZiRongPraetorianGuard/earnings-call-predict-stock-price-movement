randomized data result expansion cohort existing trial know observed remarkable activity secondline pancreatic cancer patient treated folfiri relapsed standard care gemabraxane standard care unfortunately curative patient relapsed within short period time furthermore response rate patient according expert published information range talking reference arm response rate short duration course denominator data presented small fact patient seen significant drop cancer count patient seen shrinkage tumor mind classified response patient seen shrinkage tumor size given u high level confidence trial expanded enrolled believe around patient randomized trial data maturing data matures confirm result smaller denominator initial patient think reason go fda ask requirement potential accelerated approval indication also colleague may said indication potentially potentially indication go approval one subject expansion trial confirm initial result smaller denominator smaller denominator result compelling example lung cancer egfr mutant patient investigate fact subset specific egfr mutation expand cohort understand verify profound reduction tumor size seen earlier trial similar jj larger patient population bispecific last report saw patient population tenth size may pursuing estimate product billion sale opportunity pursue driven small trial specific patient population yield high response rate typically de facto biomarkerdriven identification patient population applies lung cancer certain subset lung cancer applies also different format neoadjuvant particular case seen neoadjuvant trial surgerysparing talk surgerysparing talking surgery would debilitating patient removal rectum debilitating outcome particularly younger patient population particularly mean debilitating patient lower colon lower left colon tumor closest rectum going yield radical surgery would horrible prevent neodjuvant strategy believe tremendous opportunity looking option course stay tunedcolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst helpful thank one really quick followup neoadjuvant next neoadjuvant setting study allow potential skip surgery altogether patient
