thank frank proud progress made last quarter hope get sense momentum underway development new production opportunity team confident matter time announce license deal solidify potential atomeras business future addition great give peek early compound semiconductor work could form whole new revenue stream company everything power get st production quickly simultaneously building diversified sustained business around first deal thanks always support mike take questionsmike bishop ok thank scott operator instruction right first question come richard shannon craighallum richard would kindly unmute turn camera already great may beginrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst right mike hear memike bishop yesrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst excellent hi scott frank thanks taking question guess maybe ask first one kind new know new language using put press release well regarding proposal record number proposal quarter versus last guess understand significance degree proposal kind push mechanism versus pull mechanism customer kind get understanding true demand interest take thatscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah mike glad asked question important understand push proposal generate proposal send people time make proposal gone far enough road customer work interested receiving proposal u course share budgetary idea business u first day creating proposal term sheet everything around lot work talking type proposal speculative send hope respond type thingrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok helpful want make sure kind sweet spot technology area proposal going different mix past obviously talked lot rfsoi powerscott bibaud president chief executive officer think talked little bit script proposal going almost focused area yes would say focused area addition one area talked something done lot work far something hoping enter time good potentialrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok helpful let u see question two stmicro talked think last couple quarter one next major step getting pdk frozen something visibility stmicro expectation timing thatscott bibaud president chief executive officer yes definitely view development process clear view exact schedule asked u share publicly able provide guidance exactly thing get done tell track shared prior presentation kind timeline process like graphic showing process standard process people would use industry kind standard timeline still think reasonable one thing st agreed say track processrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok right fair enough scott probably missed writing exact language topic rfsoi think said something along line running wafer manufacturer maybe repeat passage help u understand point comment pleasescott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah rfsoi market certain amount manufacturer really constitute bulk capacity available industry today working vast majority starting wafer lot themrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok ok fair enough let u jump large analog player got license mstcad guess kind see outcome work think frank mentioned effecting license generate license revenue throughout year sure implies stopping point expect outcome hope outcome happen frank comment revenue lasting year imply going next year end point work want correlate two comment understand dynamic therescott bibaud president chief executive officer yes ok apologize little confusing mstcad tool licensed customer like cadence synopsys would license tool customer case customer signed oneyear license mean going stop end year mean contract place would extended got closer like simulation model license mean well mean large customer work nextgeneration process adding mst see make sense adding simulation level easy try bunch different thing give advice different way integrating get different level performance improvement seen result think like next goal would get take installation manufacturing license install fab actually start running wafer inside fab could actually demo u send u wafer run wafer fab would really encouraging install tcad license kind first step directionrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst got ok helpful maybe moving first jda partner obviously place remember many year like two three year think last quarter talked strong engagement slowed holiday seem remember exact language looking note sound like strong interest business unit decision made maybe give u sense back forth iteration happening expecting maybe kind help u relative sounded like getting fairly close next step several month agoscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah think frustrating situation jda guy couple year ago gave u set specification met specification said ok going present business unit consider adopting working number business unit last year gave u whole bunch test spec wanted u run wafer simulation prove could solve end last year pretty much provided test data reviewed agreed met frustrating phase saying yes stuff seems work well kind identify timing going make change particular area decide whether going adopt license going back forth month think may impression give many update literally talking guy constantly right gotten point announce agreement yes frustrating u sure frustrating investor look like anything lot gotten finish line think unusual look back stmicro engagement really think shown data needed installation get started finally license u got started certain extent prepared sitting shelf ready grab something shelf put placerichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enoughscott bibaud president chief executive officer typically license customer ask pay upfront license fee sign going need use technology year would license right away right might little bit holdup wellrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok ok fair enough jump line probably come back thanks detail scottscott bibaud president chief executive officer okmike bishop ok richard thank looking question coming qa chat first one regard stmicro st make next milestone scale fee atomera receivefrank laurencio chief financial officer happy take one said since time signed announced signature deal consistent model licensing customer expect total fee neighborhood million stage licensing consistent math based revenue recognized already last quarter recognized originally integration license several year ago pretty significant term revenue talked inability give revenue guidance implying know much would rather something give guidance timing going recognized policy always guide next quarter solid visibility beyond kind visibility yet get closer long consistent confidentiality give guidance get closermike bishop ok answered next question timing st answered quite well another question came record number commercial proposal manufacturing production license manufacturing production integration licensesscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah take part trying push customer install customer used working big tool manufacturer typically tool manufacturer come say hey got new tool solve problem way work usually ask tool manufacturer number demo first tool manufacturer demo back fab send wafer mindset u would try integration license get manufacturing goal try get people install put fab start manufacturing wafer soon possible think proposal outstanding right include manufacturing license preclude fact might demo get theremike bishop ok serious talk wafer supplier deal blanket mst wafer rfsoiscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah answer yes something talking various wafer supplier time think anything announce yet believe position one rfsoi customer ready make decision go production mean mean probably another year year half least go production able arrange wafer supplier deliver mst rfsoi wafer path want go definitely done prework think could put together clear also make available rfsoi customer buy rfsoi wafer deposit mst license u lot way workmike bishop ok question maybe comment replacement tsi think addressed little bit prepared comment replacement tsi signedscott bibaud president chief executive officer yes would say spoken almost dozen company maybe le lot company seems clear lot good option customer mean possible supplier much better process technology used tsi one specialty process want think getting close starting working one doubt end working multiple supplier one think get started first one soon yes think replacement tsi well waymike bishop ok great richard shannon followup question richard would unmute turn camerarichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst mike let turn camera hear memike bishop yeah hear go aheadrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok allowing oh go maybe yes go scott wanted follow one response earlier question related stmicro said basically showed data requested back start pulled shelf guess kind applying set customer engagement many customer essentially satisfied data asked sitting around think reasonable think delay technology like satisfying spec waiting x number year stmicros case three year get production something expect extraordinarily long time would relate experience customer gotten point seem like made good progressscott bibaud president chief executive officer yeah tricky one answer richard honest st surprised think surprised u gave result happy never went dime kept conversation time like every month would meet would say yes keep waiting think number customer run wafer seen good result currently process going production could say exactly many whether think going typical pull shelf say lot customer yes shown good result keep talking keep kind pushing little think engage sometime soon jda good example example like actually lot example like yes frustrating thing could see result pull trigger would great normally business like customer put rfq need certain type product go pitch product decide best win experience semiconductor whole career business little bit different going proactively telling hey used technology make product little bit better part kind putting mind even convinced case sometimes wait planned change process node happening implement say whether would take long time short time enough experience itrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst seems like conversation conference call offline well smell like rfsoi kind mirroring stmicro way seems like suggested outright told u satisfied requirement think even talked requirement changing point seems like rfsoi mirror lot described stmicro fair comparisonscott bibaud president chief executive officer yes let let u say customer engage engage soon right soon get interested enough start testing technology customer plan process bring new version two year working new process simultaneously trying show technology good maybe even one year left say wow technology really good late implement process already working two year kind missed bus one wait one go production production year make new version sometimes face like say enough shot net going hit right timing one come back aroundrichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enough perspective one last question scott touching topic leading edge think even asked past call sound like long period engagement multiple player leading edge guess essential question think work mature enough possibility intersecting first generation new technology coming talking nanosheet gateallaround think implemented first twonanometer node one guy think going early enough seem like might followon derivative process later time framescott bibaud president chief executive officer hard say say leadingedge guy know technology know could help obviously one decided definitely going certainly would license u one thing gateallaround new node hard make complicated call demo industry run wafer send u put technology send back gateallaround complicated make thing really install customer site sign license license definitely announce obviously announced yet think wellpositioned get one also think gateallaround even advanced finfet node still running relatively low yield compared like mature node room u even incorporated improve yield design finger crossed get donerichard shannon craighallum capital group analyst ok fair enough question scott thank youscott bibaud president chief executive officer sure thanks richardmike bishop ok one last question qa line could describe business model entering gan market would different approach license approach todate licensing mstscott bibaud president chief executive officer yes gan market interesting actually whole compound semiconductor area research year although first announcement something started thinking multiple way business model used gan license mst technology like today regular semiconductor maker adopt mst wafer build gan wafer top one way could probably license gan technology separately rest licensed technology may high value second thing could maybe could become manufacturer gan wafer least modest volume would allow u generate revenue highvalue technology maybe could make nicelooking gross margin help subsidize rest business decision yet mean strong philosophy making business model got lot leverage bottom line become manufacturer obviously would lot capex might work well could something smaller volume manufacturing side think customer would go highvolume manufacturing likely licensed directly looking gan market lot marketing study going approach got final determination tell think would much faster time market pretty excited prospect mst prospect area compound semiconductor marketmike bishop great ok scott concludes qa session could proceed closing commentsscott bibaud president chief executive officer ok sure well hope today given good picture compelling prospect atomera pursuing oppenheimer th annual emerging growth oneonone conference may th planning attend would welcome opportunity meet please continue look news article blog post available along investor alert website atomeracom additional question
