first caller line thank question answer operatoryes first one ask question gokul hariharan jp morgangokul hariharan jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah hi good afternoon thanks taking question first question demand cc kind reduced expectation overall semiconductor industry growth could talk little bit area seen slower pickup demand think talked smartphone couple time call primarily smartphone area seen slower pickup term demand previously couple quarter back talked cannibalization decline regular data center demand due crowding ai drag tsmc see regular compute regular data center networking kind demand coming back still remaining muted demand uptick still focused aijeff su ok gokul thank gokuls first question little bit two part note lowered overall semiconductor exmemory growth forecast year approximately foundry mid high teen gokul want understand segment application area seeing slower pickup demand also term specifically ai versus traditional server seeing demand shape impact tsmc generally correct gokulgokul hariharan jpmorgan chase company analyst yes think maybe since called smartphone maybe mention see smartphone demand compared maybe three month back wellcc wei chief executive officer well gokul cc wei let answer question comment also yes smartphone endmarket demand seeing gradual recovery steep recovery course pc bottomed recovery slower however airelated data center demand strong traditional server demand slow lukewarm iot consumer remain sluggish automotive inventory continue correct ok mean tsmc budget hyperscale player wallet share shifted traditional server ai server favorable tsmc able capture semiconductor content ai server area define gpu edge ai networking processor etc well lower presence cpuonly cpucentric traditional server expect growth healthy answer question gokulgokul hariharan jpmorgan chase company analyst ok yes wanted ask smartphone main change compared let u say back january growth semi across board seeing slower recoveryjeff su gokul asking sort versus three month ago seen major shift overall end market particular area seenwendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes gokul three month ago project one platform automotive platform increase year expecting decrease think one area saw differentgokul hariharan jpmorgan chase company analyst ok second question wanted understand gross margin trend talked percentage point gross margin dilution n ramp second half year think nrelated gross margin drag severe usual seen leadingedge node past largely similar seen n n go n think kind similar pattern think gross margin dilution lower go like future process node given n seems least compared previous cycle seems dragging little bit compared like n n past yearsjeff su ok thank gokul let summarize second question basically gross margin gokul note n wendell said dilute margin point percentage point second half question seems n gross margin dilution drag severe past node n n case also course n upcoming face similar pattern margin profile n think wendell address yeswendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes gokul true n taking longer time reach corporate margin node like n n n n like quarter reach corporate n think take quarter probably n process complexity increased also corporate average gross margin also increased period another reason set pricing n early several year ahead production however experienced lot cost inflation pressure following year result n take longer time n n reach corporate average gross margin n based see far better job cost selling value expect n better margin profile ngokul hariharan jpmorgan chase company analyst ok clear thank youjeff su ok thank gokul operator move next participant pleaseoperatorthe next one ask question brett simpson aretebrett simpson arete research analyst yeah thanks much question ai return tsmc think clear ai producing large profit pool customer hbm also driving supernormal return memory player question tsmc believe getting fair share return ai value chain today scope tsmc raise pricing ai chip futurejeff su ok thank brett bretts first question looking airelated demand note ai customer earning good return hbm component well question whether tsmc feel earning capturing fair value right value return think pricing would price ai basically think brett sorry question rightbrett simpson arete research analyst itcc wei chief executive officer well let answer question always say want sell value continuous process tsmc let tell working happy customer well customer well tsmc well let summarize working hopefully sell valuebrett simpson arete research analyst right followup question wanted yes great jeff followup question lighting edge node tsmc looking q sale nanometer overall revenue node collectively year year overall sale maybe share u whether see recovery year node seeing lot government support building new fabs yous china around lighting edge node concerned structural overcapacity older node cyclejeff su ok thank brett bretts second question mature node note demand mature node nanometer older year year wonder sort outlook recovery mature node second half year think first part questioncc wei chief executive officer ok brett let answer question first mature node demand remains sluggish site announced whole semiconductor industry gradually recovering fast enough expect gradually improve second half mentioned concern overcapacity company continue build lot mature node capacity u actually strategy mature node work closely strategic customer develop specialty technology solution meet requirement create appreciated longlasting value customer le exposed possible overcapacity environment believe utilization profitability mature node well protectedjeff su answer second question brettbrett simpson arete research analyst clearjeff su ok thank brettbrett simpson arete research analyst yeah great thank jeffjeff su right thanks brett operator move next participant pleaseoperatornext one randy abrams ubsrandy abrams ubs analyst yes hi thank wanted ask question following cc comment ramp profile similar nanometer nanometer could clarify timing meaningful revenue ramp node expectation would starting early ramping steep potential pull second question noted tapeouts higher would potential higher tapeouts three five either steeper ramp larger prior node underway looking couple yearsjeff su ok randys first question around nanometer first question cc said n ramp profile similar n also said course production begin question partly expect see revenue contribution meaningful revenue contribution n also n tapeouts higher multiyear opportunity contribution n maybe term revenue compared n nodescc wei chief executive officer randy n ramp profile say similar n look cycle time start n production second half actually last quarter cycle time kind backend process expect meaningful revenue start end first quarter beginning second quarter mean profile similar n second question lot engagement tapeout higher see steep kind production well expect let say n complicated work complex technology node customer also take little bit longer time prepare tapeout engage tsmc early stage product rampup product road map business consideration however still say n big node tsmc randy answer questionrandy abrams ubs analyst ok great helpful color yes yes helpful color second question relating upward expectation gave ai accelerator curious tie looking capex say entering either higher growth investment cycle capital intensity could need rise mids range set least absolute dollar billion year start growing thinking capex least growing revenuejeff su ok randys second question basically think strong airelated demand mean capex capacity planning also mean capital intensity outlookwendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes randy tsmc higher level capital expenditure always correlated higher growth opportunity following year work customer closely capex capacity planning always based longterm structural market demand profile underpinned multiyear megatrends always review capex plan ongoing basis key enabler ai work customer closely plan appropriate level capacity support needsjeff su term capital intensity capex dollar outlookwendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes capital intensity past year high invested heavily meet strong customer demand increase rate increase capex leveling year next several year expecting capital intensity somewhere mids level said opportunity future year invest accordinglyjeff su answer second question randyrandy abrams ubs analyst could ask quick followup yes sorry ask quick followup would viewed bit digestion year since ramped lot nanometer spending past couple year kick like mean look lower see kind normal trendjeff su think randys question randy still asking capex correctrandy abrams ubs analyst yes sorry still capex capex digestion year since ramped lot three spending already nanometer still lot still front uswendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes randy would call digestion year mean every year invest based forwardlooking business opportunity constantly review seeing future fund investing would call digestion year okrandy abrams ubs analyst ok goodoperatorand next one ask question charlie chan morgan stanleycharlie chan morgan stanley analyst first question selling value think another caller also addressed topic want go little bit deeper given effort made right also ongoing cost challenge made coming yous fab electricity cost hike sure give investor kind range potential price adjustment kind value going sell customer based back testing think based revenue shipment calculate price hike could around price hike cc sure whether planning hike price kind range magnitude comfortable achieve gross margin jeff su ok charlies first question tsmcs pricing strategy note tsmc course make lot effort deliver technology leadership manufacturing excellence customer also face lot cost challenge whether electricity price hike higher cost overseas fabs question number one guess intention pricing strategy sell value number two would like know percentage range anycc wei chief executive officer ok charlie cc wei first would like emphasize kind pricing strategy confidential totally tsmc customer however let expand little bit encounter kind higher cost overseas even recently inflation electricity expect customer share higher cost u already started discussion customer said overseas fab want share value also includes flexibility geopolitical location something like customer request certain area definitely tsmc customer share incremental cost charlie answer questioncharlie chan morgan stanley analyst yes think answer question think passing cost cost incremental cost customer fair especially creating lot value customer second question ai know cost capacity tight strategic wondering going judge demand allocate capacity different type ai semi customer hearing major customer demanding two time capacity next year wondering going allocate mean still reserve certain percentage smaller strategic customer matter asic smaller gpu vendor kind benchmark going allocate capacity customer ok major customer demand fulfilled ok give market share industry competitorsjeff su ok charlies second question around guess basically advanced packaging specifically cowos course note cowos capacity demand strong today also capacity tight question tsmc decide allocate capacity customer large customer reserve capacity support smaller customer well lastly would ok customer want use somebody else speak several part questioncc wei chief executive officer charlie let say demand strong done best put effort increase capacity probably double year compared last year however still enough meet customer demand leverage osat partner complement tsmcs capacity fulfill customer need still enough course mind first priority make customer successful matter one course longterm partner better cooperation tsmc term technology processing complexity much easier ramped however matter let say demand high extremely high best increase capacity alleviate shortage also leverage osat partner want make sure customer get supported probably enough year next year try try hard mentioned giving market share consideration consideration help customer successful marketcharlie chan morgan stanley analyst see since major customer said room type ai computing chip seems like tsmc happy see similar customer right right interpretation commentscc wei chief executive officer yesjeff su yes cc said customer yes thank charlieoperatornext one ask question bruce lu goldman sachsbruce lu goldman sachs analyst think question coming back ai still think currently ai accelerator mostly nanometer n minus one comparing smartphone expect catch surplus term technology node see technology driver nanometer abovejeff su ok bruce first question looking ai accelerator note view currently nanometer question expect catch see ai accelerator also maybe hpc whole driver adopter tsmcs leadingedge advanced technology node correct brucebruce lu goldman sachs analyst yes correctcc wei chief executive officer ok bruce let answer question yes observation right today ai accelerator nanometer technology customer working tsmc next node even next next node move fast said power consumption considered ai data center energyefficient fairly important nanometer much better nanometer improved nanometer say customer working kind trend nanometer brucebruce lu goldman sachs analyst case see yes case see bigger revenue first two year nanometer past smartphone nanometer would smartphone hpc customersjeff su bruce asking well strong airelated demand see revenue nanometer first two year compared past nodeswendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes bruce said believe advanced technology longlasting node larger node n n n dollar value certainly largerjeff su think bruce locating opportunity multiyear period wendell cc said certainly demand seeing expect n revenue contribution even larger n like three larger contribution larger node five etc etcbruce lu goldman sachs analyst see second question dividend see strong free cash flow first quarter capital intensity wendell mentioned stabilizing even started pay huge amount return tax turn aggressive term dividend current dividend level much much lower free cash flow backofenvelope calculation expect see dividend coming quartersjeff su ok thank bruce bruce second question cash dividend policy note first quarter generating strong free cash flow said capital intensity beginning stabilize also paying high retained earnings tax question think outlook pay dividend coming quarter investor expectwendell huang vice president chief financial officer yes bruce dividend policy principle pay free cash flow year cash dividend would look quarterly cash free cash flow make judgment indeed said harvesting heavy investment past year expect dividend policy switch steadily increasing sustainable past yearsoperatornext one laura chen citilaura chen citi analyst question edge ai know cc mentioned smartphone pc recovery still probably prolonged yet also seeing ai pc ai smartphone getting quite topical wondering tsmcs view kind edge ai device take maybe later implication tsmc first questionjeff su ok thank laura lauras first question ai specifically edge call ondevice ai note ai added smartphones also ai pc quite topical want know see trend importantly implication tsmc correct lauralaura chen citi analyst yescc wei chief executive officer ok laura let answer question edge ai ondevice ai first order magnitude die size saw without ai ai neuroprocessor inside die size increased ok first observed happening future would think replacement cycle smartphone kind pc accelerated little bit future least happening yet expect happen soon would say ondevice ai positive tsmc capture larger share market answer question lauralaura chen citi analyst yes case yes helpful case expect demand see still mostly smartphone mobile expect n revenue contribution second half next year bigger say like plus second half yearjeff su ok well lauras followon first question expect n demand second half sorry catch exact percentage large percentage significantly larger today correct lauralaura chen citi analyst yescc wei chief executive officer ok certainly said expect happen larger die size said already observed replacement cycle accelerated happen give definite number early predict upward trend doubt expect good businesswendell huang vice president chief financial officer follow cc comment last time also said year n revenue triple revenue laura chen citi analyst ok clear second question advanced packaging know tsmc working dic many year wondering current progress expect see meaningful takeoff n rampup like highcomputing pc different kind technology like hybrid bonding tsv tsmcs major considerationjeff su ok lauras guess second question although yes fine second question advanced packaging solution dic solution wondering outlook takeup demand next several year also would like u comment consideration tsv versus hybrid bonding suchcc wei chief executive officer wow asked technical question tsv hybrid bonding together dics packaging technology complicated customer start adopt big volume yet expect start grow year big hard say think trend whether microbumping hybrid connection depends customer product requirementjeff su ok lauralaura chen citi analyst starting year see yes yes quickly starting later year see dic product customer current progressjeff su laura asking start see dic product customer whencc wei chief executive officer sorry said customer start adopt would expect product market soon rightjeff su thank laura ok interest time maybe take question last two participant call thank operatoroperatornext one rolf bulk new street researchrolf bulk new street research analyst earlier call mentioned possibility converting much n capacity n wondering considering strong demand ai chip recovery smartphones scenario would consider similar conversion older node n given utilization revenue still well peak levelsjeff su ok rolf first question tool commonality conversion note already said converting capacity using n tool support strong multiyear demand n airelated question given nanometer still underutilized also consider converting nanometer tool support leadingedge stronger demandcc wei chief executive officer well let answer question convert one technology node capacity next one gi physical advantage meaning let give one example nanometer nanometer adjacent fabs connected much easier tsmc convert five three mean every node one question n converted n presumably expect n next couple year pick demand pick want repeat probably repeat kind experience nanometer today solid plan convert n njeff su ok rolf answer first questionrolf bulk new street research analyst yes unrelated followupjeff su surerolf bulk new street research analyst yes unrelated followup
