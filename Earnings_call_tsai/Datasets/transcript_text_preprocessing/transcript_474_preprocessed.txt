later presentation value expect added keno hill drill bit exploration success confirms significant exploration potential turning slide owned casa berardi mine decade good mine time however acquired back realized potential significant value open pit anticipated start production later mine life see value crystallizing work pit move way toward west mine crown pillar principal pit anticipate seeing mine generate substantial free cash flow however investment property based report anticipate seeing cash flow property slightly negative year turn positive next significant return large portion investment past couple year prior taking production pause accommodating permitting time frame highergrade pit expect process stockpile followed production gap three year highergrade pit start production revised technical report anticipates mine life year returning undiscounted cash flow nearly million discounted cash flow almost demonstrates value mine brings hecla portfolio turn slide turn call carloscarlos aguiar vice president operation thanks russell make comment since outside remote phil russell first safety strong overall safety record one mine suspected inaudible done green creek injury frequency rate lucky friday lowest history casa berardi lot change keno safety unacceptable operation started safety program focusing leading indicator like near miss risk assessment interaction inspection expect make four operation safer technical difficulty four operation started year strong lucky friday restarted planned first week january keno hill safer therefore beginning ramp faster green creek got weather event behind casa berardi continued good performance last month difference year four property operational pas phil starting slide phil baker president chief executive officer thanks carlos labeled green creek slide foundation heclas future since grow green creek continue foundation providing stability consistency cash flow production well future mine reported strong year could even better without weather reducing day production fourth quarter expect mine another consistent year production expected million million ounce little le silver also produce little le gold due mine sequencing mining lower grade produce bit higher zinc zinc grade bit higher cost per ounce higher also increasing capital replacing mobile mill equipment risk mitigation operating around ton per day becomes particularly important higher throughput really need everything reliable really opportunity catch upset like done green creek year still see opportunity lower cost know investment allow u lower cost also increased recovery investment slide show planned surface underground exploration program testing multiple target significant potential add resource green creek started mine mine plan seven year year later mine plan year past year underground exploration good success seven eight zone drilled four zone fourth quarter excited year program coordinate drilling underground surface drilling east ore upper plate gallagher also drill land package recently acquired mammoth claim interest acquiring claim least year cliff creek known prospective area called cliff creek almost inaccessible started mapping past year logistical issue noted need contractor think going able focus expanding highgrade mineralization also making new discovery new discovery cliff creek potentially mammoth claim green creek premier silver mine actually th largest world want congratulate team delivering excellent consistent result giving great future truly worldclass asset let u turn slide green creek foundation heclas future lucky friday pillar nearterm growth value consistency culture leadership lucky friday brings make second cornerstone asset put together green creek two mine make u largest silver producer united state mine restarted early january carlos mentioned production million ounce cost per ounce similar green creek capital million le year last year despite year mine plan focusing potential expand mine east current elevation drilling exploration east lot unknown success could mean production lower cost mine already stabilized starting work small improvement allow higher throughput like five new cyclone putting mill installed june going move slide keno hill struck two thing first ore body growing similar better quality going take minute talk exploration make say couple minute first though want talk second thing struck safety environmental performance met standard fixing overnight exercise given long life see laserfocused patient improving safety mean changing people attitude habit engineering risk taken many senior people corporate technical team also lucky friday rotating site basically mentoring keno team example engineering risk budgeted cemented tailing backfill plant birmingham enable mine underhand mining would safer way mining environmental issue keno study make site meet standard one thing come study putting new water filtration plant birmingham build year cost maybe million million point giving guidance production reporting unit cost want make sure safety environmental issue right without pressure combined production target cost say though think going produce million ounce silver expect spend million million quarter million capital current price small investment year make keno given exploration potential long mine plan now time get right similar happened green creek almost year ago speaking green creek decided try create value green creek keno try implement many synergy possible actually two hour apart sevenhour drive two site get skagway short minute flight many supply keno actually go green creek skagway get trucked keno going going promote brian erickson vp gm green creek kim campbell green creek controller provide leadership operation brian addition job green creek gm last two decade led various department headed mining done surface ops done maintenance kim led purchasing warehousing accounting number function know exactly synergy value try outline time given maturity system green creek really accelerate keno becoming strong cash flow generating mine let go exploration keno slide drilling program continue provide quite remarkable mineralized drill hole intercept underground definition surface exploration drilling going talk birmingham morning realized series target keno drill next year actually get drilling much drilling birmingham get surface look plan view middle slide marked b bprime upper corner see birmingham deposit number zone etta arctic bear northeast deep northeast small image right show b bprime going zone see aprime cross section actually go bear zone look leftmost image aprime upper corner bear zone three vein main vein footwall vein bear vein want draw attention ounce foot transverse vein main footwall vein widest highestgrade intercept aware similar grade intercept quarter earlier quite wide looking back b bprime image middle red star highgrade mineralization thousand foot deeper previous drilling longstanding view keno potential top foot foot surface evidence highgrade mineralization hosted full depth one kilometer favorable basal quartzite host rock unit two hole really think emblematic potential keno turning slide last year concluded could generate enough margin mining two separate underground deposit open pit like said beginning remark many people actually people employee contractor enough value rock operate mine way made decision simplify operation shutting underground team really successfully implemented change half year underground operation mine already developed scope surface ton coming pit go slide show production cost capital guidance silver production guidance show increase year silver cost guidance slightly higher cash cost aisc still substantial margin current even lower price prof really lowcost leader industry gold cost guidance lower capital guidance lower
