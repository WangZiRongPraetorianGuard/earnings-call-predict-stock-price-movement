approved either black box warning andor rem program perhaps importantly view implication commercial perspective either scenariochip scarlett yeah lot supposition corinne let say first going hear everybody say going comment ongoing conversation regulator obvious reason getting really close milestone event let say think warranted think perspective either black box rem program warranted predicting go little speculative u inaudible feel confident inaudible imetelstat used safely effectively cell target populationcorinne johnson goldman sachs analyst ok thankschip scarlett sorry yeah second part question think corinne johnson goldman sachs analyst commercial commercial indication implementedchip scarlett corinne pure speculation think stay speculation think everybody understands depends certainly come either black box warning contraindication nuanced issue refrain speculation nuance never good thing perspective kind depends get together focused forward beyond type issue hopecorinne johnson goldman sachs analyst ok thank youoperatoryour next question come line kalpit patel b riley line openkalpit patel b riley financial analyst yeah hey good morning thanks taking

scrap information case far aware looked every scrap information relate way shape form liver hepatotoxicity liver safety letter docket people read simply reaffirms belief imetelstat safe drug liver perspective really came think leave kind wellconfined area interest many people aware interest especially decade agokalpit patel b riley financial analyst ok thanks taking questionoperatoryour next question come line stephen willey stifel line opensteve willey stifel financial corp analyst yeah thanks taking question guess sure able speak remind u frequency platelet cell count monitoring imerge trial guess think potential product label would expect monitoring requirement bit stringent trialchip scarlett think recall steve weekly monitoring first several cycle think whatever trial unlikely looked regulator sort de facto standard comment inaudible know go exactly think make sense given u ability really interrogate frequency sort course cytokine know indeed shortlived well managed manageable guess say know studied way think de facto standard would expect going forward cytokine perspectivesteve willey stifel financial corp analyst ok know guess proportion patient mean obviously lowrisk md dysplastic marrow know proportion already weekly cell count whether home whether heme officechip scarlett inaudible interesting question would say kind depends journey say kind level disclosure forth experience saw placebo arm patient simply also showed meaningful cytopenia even though receiving placebo whatever background therapy allowed hand think regular monitoring probably associated different product patient take monitoring would associated inaudible estimate would something would get started start new drug histologist would follow closely kind make sense ultimately physician whatever label say decide frequency sort carry course treatment drug included trialssteve willey stifel financial corp analyst ok maybe kind biggerpicture question mean obviously kind ongoing narrative among investor regarding exclusivity runway development program imetelstat still necessarily expanding broadened additional indication curious guess phase study reflect internal confidence ip think opportunity could bring online quickly maybe carve additional orphan drug designation would kind interested term thinking longerterm rd program drugchip scarlett sure think referring clear improvemf aml study get question right thatsteve willey stifel financial corp analyst yeah correct rux combo study chip scarlett sure think incumbent every company developing drug regardless kind whatever nuance ip position think study new combination study different utility drug sorry unpleasant mean move kind high level think basis think think benefit derived patient become really interested rux really good example know written people know whole series preclinical experiment done number year ago good lab scientist looked question whether different way exploit intrinsic activity telomerase inhibitor cell malignantly transformed ultimately myelofibrosis clinical outcome see end treating inaudible disrupt cell recall jak inhibitor see damage sort chase come laboratory inaudible telomerase inhibitor case epoxide actually get higher proportion animal surviving longer also see depletion living hematopoietic stem cell key u start ultimately work necessary start study go upfront frontline patient b hope able actually ultimately improved efficacy although study predominantly safety study c guess people going people somewhere world start would think know drug helped better anybody else control sorry kind inaudible think rationale aml aml terrible disease relapsedrefractory patient option drug horizon hope patient sake also inaudible goal really patient absolutely something reasonably innovative think innovative ultimately file intellectual property protection play completely separate story one interestingsteve willey stifel financial corp analyst ok make sense

adept managing hemerelated side effect patient point prolonged myelosuppression hmas etc area managed successfully long period time imetelstat particular really important receive really favorably predictability cytopenia fact cytopenia typically finite duration tend go away cycle two cycle three also importantly clinical consequence associated cytopenia term infection hospitalization bleeding event also provide context mechanism action something received favorably practicing hematologist see much difference community versus academic hematologist term perception management heme toxicity adept training also practice experience regard question myelofibrosis think also area fastmoving obviously wait see happens bcl bet inhibitor term entering landscape reminder myelofibrosis phase study
