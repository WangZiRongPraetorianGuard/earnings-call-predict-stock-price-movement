instruction ask please limit one question single followup may reenter queue question time pause momentarily assemble roster today first question come colin rusch oppenheimer please go ahead colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy start entering newer market energy storage talk much volume guiding q could considered selling build little bit inventory support customersbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah could please repeat question colin follow properly colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst sure start selling energy storage new market looking q guide much energy storage sale dynamic actually selling channel channel get prepared marketsbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer much really new market ramping u example introduced storage italy q really one introduced new market prior see introduced european country prior introduced uk fact storage channel healthy actually normalized speak storage said storage fact give data talk call sellthrough battery q overall worldwide megawatt hour sellthrough battery q megawatt hour much better seasonality seeing product battery well general yet despite megawatt hour sellthrough discipline ship megawatt hour mean took megawatt hour channel channel quite lean storage see increasing guidance guided q guided megawatt hour guiding q guiding megawatt hour storage storage good story expect continue expect long term every market transition solar plus storage talked color market netherlands talked france talked germany already california get soon general storage good story uscolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much pricing dynamic look like microinverter pricing maybe ish quarter quarter average talk little bit dynamic around pricing discount get inventory flush expect get middle year badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right measure something called asp variance measure something called customer variance customer variance mean much pricing drop particular customer quarter quarter asp variance simply function mix example lower pricing particular customer volume went show overall reduction asp really measure effectiveness pricing come customer asp variance dropping pricing particular customer answer disciplined seeing result mix extremely disciplined come talked order move inventory need lower pricing play game like disciplined disciplined sell value seeing purely product mix issuecolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst excellent super helpful thanks guy operatorthank next question today come brian lee goldman sachs please go ahead brian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guy good afternoon thanks taking question badri talk little bit said onset call undership demand q little bit le destocked little bit le would expected demand softer million destock kind clear inventory micros q guide saying normalized seeing inferring normalized demand strip million destock running like know last call talking maybe highlevel kind walk u thought process demand seeing normalized level look like get inventory reset maybe time frame think kind get back normalized run rate well badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer got brian q sellthrough demand end customer demand million q reported revenue million therefore math million minus million million shipment q guided million million midpoint guidance million said estimated sellthrough q reflective customer demand million difference two million minus million way million minus million million shipment could million second half year talking market expect europe example continuously improve netherlands government approved net metering foreseeable future starting see lead generation much higher netherlands start result increased sellthrough increased activation netherlands big deal next one france france utility rate helping u see despite environment expect france strong third one germany reported sellthrough higher q q cost electricity high expect solar storage solar battery continuously grow top talked product introduction last year set nice introducing iq battery everywhere country even q introduced battery italy prior introduced uk introduced sweden denmark et cetera prior going list everything attacking new market asia well europe let u come back u u dynamic noncalifornia state california state california noncalifornia state multiple data point u tell thing improving last week let u say last four week seeing better sellthrough number compared saw prior first data point second one internal solargraf software used plus installers therefore look sale proposal contract see number continuously going march number march versus february number april versus march good sign course anecdotal interaction customer california last four week universally said march much better sale month february last one see thirdparty analytics report like talk permitting see general permit noncalifornia well california month march versus february way trend told valid noncalifornia well california last week cautiously optimistic thing turning said q bottom quarter raising guidance million million q said sellthrough going million million growth trend expect sellthrough continuously go last one point wanted talk interest rate hear going likely two interest rate two cut instead maybe three four planned anytime cut going expand noncalifornia state even meaning demand could come play brian lee goldman sachs analyst understood ok super helpful guess think kind trying dissect normalized demand outlook channel clean exiting q looking barring meaningful mix change pricing change demand staying basically think today like million reason would shipping level q mean structural shift channel willing take kind lead time thing nature guess trying understand million put take million stay million versus think view earlier year would higher million right million move higher potentially move lower go opposite direction badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah think said correct meaning channel normalized sellin sellout balanced right example expect sellthrough q higher say sellthrough remains around let u say million level sellin would remain similar taken inventory need shipment longer sellin sellout balanced time like said several vector sellthrough improve q highlighted thing europe new product introducing noncalifornia state improving california installers learning nem financing option available installers general u starting ramp small commercial product make optimistic sellthrough would start become higher q beyondbrian lee goldman sachs analyst right appreciate thanks guy pas onoperatorthank next question come kashy harrison piper sandler please go ahead kashy harrison piper sandler analyst good evening thanks taking question badri first one indicated last quarter sellthrough expectation q million million sellthrough point came million spirit continuous improvement wondering could walk u specific input approach forecasting methodology faulty adjusted error heading second quarter essentially trying get forecasting approach improving trying get point street confidence sellthrough land expect second quarterbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right general perfect forecast based seasonality right place reported california number little bit worse see sellthrough california lower microinverters think battery think california wild card mention prior quarter think getting increasing confidence california outlined everything discussed california installers confident forecast right first week quarter seem trending directionkashy harrison piper sandler analyst fair enough appreciate followup question iq indicated first half commercial release date think said pilot later year long would take iq ramp strategically talk thinking using lowercost product u international market share perspective badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah iq first going working two flavor one watt microinverter watt microinverter watt microinverter would would consider bread butter u probably year today right time frame introducing would say typically introduction ramp new product like would four six quarter based upon experience iq two flavor thing get lot interesting going threephase volt well watt small commercial installs good principal thing iq us gallium nitride gallium nitride enables much higher power similar form factor got good efficiency dissipate much heat using ac well dc effect able get need blow microinverter form factor advantage gallium nitride allows u operate higher frequency earlier used operate today iq operating kilohertz gallium nitride go megahertz need working asic order get capability megahertz get megahertz happens basically get rid big transformer transformer size go anyone know inverter know lot dollar going term form factor thing get lot tighter since get tighter talking blowing area due higher power one concern always efficiency higher power operate efficiency dissipating lot heat like example watt let u say efficiency mean watt time watt power watt heat gallium nitride fet able operate good efficiency need blow inverter keep elegant form factor installers look bringing dollar per watt continuously u compact make microinverter integration achieve better fyi four silicon fet ac side need two silicon fet transistor got something called bidirectional switch gan operate way zooming back higher level gan allow u operate higher power lower efficiency form factor thereby dropping dollar per watt increasing power linekashy harrison piper sandler analyst helpful color thank youoperatorthank next question today come mark strouse jp morgan please go aheadmark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst got two question gross margin q guide bit guiding last couple quarter response colins question earlier mentioned mix part want confirm kind talking kind mix kind random installers selling given period anything signal far kind international mix storage mix color would help badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah talking question colin microinverters installer mix correct question asking meaning guided nongaap gross margin without ira q question yes increased battery guidance megawatt hour see q guidance increased mean battery microinverter ratio increasing getting better better better gross margin battery see number continuously improve battery specifically called three factor said cell pack cost continuing come rapidly beginning manufacture microinverters used battery beginning manufacture u provide u production tax credit exactly intention need produce product u inverter made battery last one exciting one moving integrated architecture power conversion battery management basically going happen thirdgeneration battery direction going almost get cut instead six microinverters thirdgeneration battery two microinverters one side fourthgeneration battery significantly cutting form factor expect bring another big level improvement gross margin gross margin put take battery mark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst ok helpful quick followup question x within gross margin last quarter talked unit million million benefit q talking similar number unit million million benefit sure splitting hair wanted see kind signaling maybe keeping x credit badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer happens thing happened depends upon power microinverters building sometimes may build watt microinverter per watt may build watt microinverter used inside battery function purely function fall higher power make advantage beginning told beginning make small commercial iqp microinverters starting q well u watt watt gross benefit gross production tax credit theremark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah ok make sense thank muchoperatorthank next question come praneeth satish well fargo please go aheadpraneeth satish well fargo security analyst thanks maybe staying battery looking fourthgen battery seems like large cost reduction coming guess think keeping cost saving versus passing customer guess specifically thinking context tesla powerwall today buy tesla powerwall integrated inverter going cheaper enphase battery inverter solution know apple orange using string inverter guess fourthgeneration battery ability close gap still earning margin guess trying see think opportunity next year new batterybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah let give color talked many thing talked battery talked competition talked string inverter integrated battery want remind benefit offer tremendous value trip last four week many customer experienced used string inverter idea trouble gone customer mentioned safe ac roof religion u safe ac roof want highvoltage dc first point enphase production microinverters every panel mppt panel level production enhanced almost compare normal string inverter per panel monitoring many installers love per panel monitoring homeowner love able say ok particular thing working able get service enphase ultrafast open reliability count provide year warranty competition maybe year single point failure unlike string inverter cause much higher uptime system familiar simple plugandplay install installers love simplicity additional rsd rapid shutdown device needed roof different orientation got enphase nothing else gridforming iq microinverters enabling sunlight jump start depleted battery everybody know emphasize running grid power shutdown running grid battery let u say turned ac accident battery run battery run way particular percentage battery got capability called black start open wake every minute next day say ready solar happen one two day one two day even energy battery go away battery dead state charge drop enphase iq microinverters could sunlight jump start even without grid sunlight come form grid jump start battery time battery state charge come example sunlight jump start course microinverters made america big deal many installers love come storage safe chemistry lithiumion phosphate big deal ul fire certification big deal worked fire department make sure optimized placement battery done lot ahjs california best warranty industry see competition year approximately warranty year moving part fan lowvoltage dc operation battery see concept hybrid inverter one inverter take care solar storage obviously lot stress distributed architecture mean got inverter roof take care solar got inverter battery take care storage even one inverter battery go inverter help system never field serviceable situ without taking battery wall minimizing downtime talked gross margin time say big deal overhead cost running battery business dropping quite bit figured expensive rmas expensive rmas big system hanging wall worst thing work take wall homeowner commissioned many day row take back installers warehouse oem component manufacturer battery manufacturer ship product installer spend valuable time field installing new battery homeowner losing solar storage losing selfconsumption dollar especially place like california add lot major source annoyance field serviceability situ instead taking battery take board pcb board take put new board matter hour running enhanced serviceability next one lra amp lra every kilowatt hour battery ampere kilowatt hour enough start two battery two fivekilowatt hour battery enough start threeton air conditioner power double peak continuous power double previous generation installers love simple install commission example nem nem scenario much like germany installs installs called gridtied installed gridtied install rate saver install time use install saving battery identical battery simply provides economic advantage installing battery trivial finish solar done ac roof need take two five kilowatthour battery hang ac bus nothing size main panel upgrade need worry place simply hang ac bus installation done le two hour connect combiner box use solar extra component running becoming popular rate saver battery gridtied battery becoming extremely popular told benefit enphase solar enphase storage system look one mobile app problem multiple solar storage manufacturer homeowner got mess apps possible difficult keep track information control fingertip ability take home grid enphase app provide well provide customer service field service technician take care battery installer need spend valuable time focus new install know big advantage accoupled system power solar system well battery combination mean even power one inverter constraining output course last one pc software power control system software one going invaluable installers main panel upgrade way pc simply even nem expansion system want expand nem system long export anything beyond old system still nem system support current consumption exporting energy maximum energy old system nem expansion lot easier hopefully gave color value add stopping going focused cost battery customer cost sensitive every opportunity going removing box wall raghu installers clear plan going eliminate box wall ultrasensitive response question need drop pricing providing much value compared competition sopraneeth satish well fargo security analyst got thank expensive answer maybe one quick one battery said channel normal battery battery sellthrough megawatt hour q seasonally weak quarter guidance q battery shipment megawatt hour assuming sellin equal sellthrough q maybe talk driving slight decrease megawatt hour guidance conservatism factor seems like lot tailwind battery businessbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer conservatism yes knew guy would ask question intelligent said carefully worded almost said right general battery expect run quite lean battery yes conservative seem opportunity upside therepraneeth satish well fargo security analyst got thank youoperatorthank next question today come philip shen roth mkm please go ahead philip shen roth mkm analyst hi everyone thanks taking question back brians question earlier timing normalized revenue badri think said last call million would come back half year still track million could either q q walk u likely q q chance get pushed q thanks badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer well phil know give guidance q q described tailwind growing sellthrough demand described growth vector optimistic growth vector talked put take europe talked netherlands talked france talked germany extremely bullish introducing lot new product region expect done last year expect take talked noncalifornia state seeing seasonally bounce back california would say california installers like said extremely optimistic trip last three four week data also show good trend talking sellthrough demand customer demand million q expect number go continuously q qphilip shen roth mkm analyst great ok much still path might little bit risk definitely see path sound like badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yes dophilip shen roth mkm analyst great ok thank shifting gear maybe data might even ahead sellthrough channel work suggests challenging u resi time guy gaining healthy amount share whether one source versus recent poll might gaining share market pretty healthy potentially make big difference wanted see help u understand activation implied revenue might seeing versus sellthrough obviously compared sellin track way articulate activation implied revenue maybe q maybe see q beyond thanks badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah mean see report see sellside report see third quart report focused highlighting value working installers time difficult time trying help service whether proposal whether permitting whether proper modeling whether lead whether simply understand rmas help understand service understand labor understand improve efficiency kaizen installers believe relationship installers time single reason market share gain highlighting normally sellthrough activation u take u four eight week market share gain start potentially seeing going forward know installers switched u one switch like ramp associated ramping using ramping new product would say show definitely sellthrough increase report q mean report q result q call meanphilip shen roth mkm analyst ok thanks much pas onoperatorthank next question come christine cho barclays please go ahead christine cho barclays analyst good evening thank taking question going ask sellthrough question different way million q expected get somewhere million yearend let u take midpoint million give u idea combining comment gave u individually million much driven europe versus u like half europe u much driven microinverters versus battery guy say destocking done end q assuming back week considering normalized level inventorybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yes let answer expect mean europe well u healthy growth vector u expect north america europe question christine cho barclays analyst mi versus batteriesbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer micro versus battery yes micro versus battery would say considering noncalifornia state battery attach high micro versus battery would still say micros versus battery would say last one asked week way measure week hand typically backward looking say quarter sellthrough rate inventory hand today divide inventory sellthrough rate get week hand one interesting way would expect distributor measure forwardlooking week inventory demand example last two three week show significant uptick week hand would existing amount front divided increased rate last two four week number good time forwardlooking inventory week hand lower backwardlooking week hand u consistent way measure always look whenever tell week hand tell ok sellthrough quarter happened example q happened q inventory end q channel inventory divided sellthrough week end number rule thumb general number always week upswing forwardlooking week hand could smaller christine cho barclays analyst right ok interesting nuance realize looking backwards second question said prepared remark nem system attaching battery also mentioned meeting whole bunch installers met whole bunch installers california sense whether installers using product leaning toward load shifting backup sure answered praneeths question missed also give u sense development meter color expect roll one outbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right load shifting significant fraction installers right second meter color coming benefit audience basically california something called meter main combo meter main combo meter main panel integrated one structure insert backup everybody know ugly thing like ripping load apart put backup switch therefore lot labor actually spent typically day two spent relocating load putting system controller meter main load center meter collar elegant way switch meter device come around meter got mid microgrid interconnect switch relay right meter color basically mean spend labor relocating load version meter color coming shortly piloting end yearoperatorthank next question today come james west evercore isi please go aheadjames west evercore isi analyst hey badri real quick one based conversation california last three four week met installer base talked talked earlier cut cost pretty significantly concern growth come back see ability respond growthbadri kothandaraman

question saying help u starting help u many way focus real growth start focusing training installers increase sellthrough start understanding installers enough volume sale guy focused right thing versus pushing stuff channel think company gotten lot better front last yearandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst understood thank muchbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer thank youoperatorthank next question today come maheep mandloi mizuho please go aheaddavid benjamin mizuho security analyst hi david benjamin maheep got question followup please give u insight thought solargraf market share penetration installers within u trying get visibility sale lead marketbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah thousand installers solargraf using design proposal tool hundred using permitting tooldavid benjamin mizuho security analyst ok great thanks much followup gallium nitride talk little bit like plan source material going concentrated mostly china market lastly thought impact annuity adcvd u solar demand thought nem challenge california courtsbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer gallium nitride lot source gallium nitride transistor source people already business silicon fet worried lot opportunity many people good quality gallium nitride fet raghu take question nem raghu belur chief product officer yeah nem aware challenge gone appeal court actually lost case lower court remains seen fact think going difficult overturn obviously market react differently u business usual going recognize long term solar plus battery way go really working toward making sure battery solution solar plus battery solution best class right court take time thing something really focused ondavid benjamin mizuho security analyst great thanks muchoperatorthank next question come austin moeller canaccord please go aheadaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst hi good afternoon first question market growth opportunity look like home battery sale new installation versus upgrade existing solar array already installed homesbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah raghu take itraghu belur chief product officer sure think opportunity equally valuable depends geography california example new home must solar going part nem install obviously need battery solaronly install nem bill offset going add kilowatt hour nem gridtied battery bill offset could high think make complete sense go ahead add battery case retrofit case california nem environment lot incentive go ahead add battery least bill offset already get nem case basically grid act like battery use case battery case would want resiliency backup purpose geography outside california case battery would seeing called vpp program grid service program people may come retrofit battery system avail whatever utility provides term incentive whether upfront dollar per kilowatt hour incentive adding battery ongoing incentive participation vpp program similar situation europe well example look netherlands obviously net metering market push retrofitting battery given penetration level solar get penalized uncontrolled export solar make sense move toward called selfconsumption way adding battery managing solar plus battery system software especially participating called dynamic tariff program also obviously vpp thing applies germany country europe wellaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst great followup see key growth driver demand europe germany particular primarily current utility rate see change tax credit country like italy potential impediment thatraghu belur chief product officer yeah usually seeing particularly europe refer feedin tariff inversion wherein buy rate significantly higher sell rate amount get paid feeding energy grid significantly lower retail cost energy make economic sense export even single electron grid driver selfconsumption layered top participate supporting grid vpp program get paid additional monies driver toward better roi go beyond go beyond solar plus battery seeing europe adding ev charger heat pump additional steerable asset sitting behind meter sophisticated home energy management system like ai ml work really fine optimization deliver best economics homeowner combination solar battery ev charger heat pump matter combination thereof going see italy included market europe moving toward whole energy management system asset imagine happens year two ev become fully bidirectional get yet another powerful asset sitting behind meter use optimize consumption optimize billoperatorthank next question today come dylan nassano wolfe research please go aheaddylan nassano wolfe research analyst yeah hi thanks running little long fit quick one buyback look like share repurchase quarter le matched free cash flow generation whereas q think bought back little actually generated curious thinking attractiveness repurchase level think cash allocation demand hopefully
