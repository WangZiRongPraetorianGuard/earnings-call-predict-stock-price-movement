wall right cut silo first tell possible secondly integration sometimes easy sometimes work apis intuitive case entity could custombuilt date integration bit challenge difficult overcome convey benefit easily stitch data silo together simpler one might imagine fully featured read write filter individual permission access actually really powerful layer way strength data fabric expect year organization start saying word data fabric claim got something like suspect going fully featured way built year artifact divergent data strategy many competitor data strategy whereby seek claim unify data enterprise big enough case pull use size leverage customer force kind aggregation flag attempt instead always call pro customer like open data strategy respect empowers enables customer existing

snowflake asking give u data like modern data warehouse pile everything one data source already got partnership lined gen ai top fine move data move boy talk lot cio remember saying could move data even pertinent data central repository snowflake anyone el typically today ai either run one giant silo like snowflake train address moment data fabric train essentially saying ai going run source everything upload right upload one source another want got data loading cost got data freshness issue got variable level personal security access data issue lot flaw strategy think also idea training great length algorithm cio problematic lot tech decisionmakers think even though data lake snowflake strategy train external algorithm everything pertinent strategy plausible strategy see happening absence data fabric time ai limited data know ai run one silo one think unfortunately typical fallback absence data fabrictom blakey keybanc capital market analyst interesting use case seen maybe
