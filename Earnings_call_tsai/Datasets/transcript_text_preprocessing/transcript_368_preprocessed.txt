took week hoping starting better dose front week benefit saw last year may may recall small study called abc pilot trial patient show could switch insulin pump adjust basal happens twelve week study study gave u lot insight thing correct larger trial spent money example one site titrated basal well site learned could little aggressive basal titration type thing tried get guardrail around trial ensure proper titration proper conversion obviously doctor know use insulin pump thing saw original trial knew manipulate pump well doctor use pump day long afrezza new know use advantage term dosing know followup dosing necessary kind feel pretty good trial design control within trial wait data give perspective design superiority secondary endpoint watch second question around know think real world existing pod pump physician think come patient motivation end day think kol support think continue see guideline support saw update year standard care afrezza people starting understand lower rate hypoglycemia better timing range seeing want realtime acting insulin kind adjusted every aid system pump together next next really tightening control even best tool help lot talking look data afrezza top pump potentially know fda challenge also thinking glps know still mealtime popping glps add afrezza population starting look say get positive data inhale early readout anticipate inhale

continued lack investment either enough capital go case indomed spent many year building space working fda well patient community know physician kol population really want clofazimine know patient population really want clofazimine even fda say nothing collaborate along whole journey five year going back qrum think market force aligned help support u wind back push u forward get risk running trial think reality risk population given efficacy clofazimine estimated effect size delta u placebo going interim analysis see track might increase sample little bit number one second part pro went back forth fda year month pro endpoint pro division feedback pro division two reason one comfortable running placebocontrolled trial given pretty much know active arm think make pro difficult tool therefore tried make secondary endpoint fda insistent primary coprimary endpoint rounded around long story short landed coprimary endpoint understanding little bit risky endpoint agree done best create baseline measurement improvement key measurement aligned fda efficacy going matter term sputum conversion much pro tool like know listen indomed call mean going fda lot question worked gotten lot feedback already incorporated trial design know data happens data analyze data come really important work closely fda think understand understand pro con rather keep debating thought important get data help get drug cross finish lineoren livnat hc wainwright company analyst ok clear going based clofazimine experience efficacywise assuming improvement powering assumption conservative thatmichael castagna chief executive officer think look going naive patient would think would see much higher efficacy rate focused refractory think little le obvious naive patient think saw indomed arikayce data one study really judge ntm endpoint arikayce think go back development program delta control sure placebo go back double check data work going back forth know incorporating placebo could placebo
