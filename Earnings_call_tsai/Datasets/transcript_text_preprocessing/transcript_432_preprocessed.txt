line question question answer operatorthank operator instruction please stand compile qa roster first question come line michael lonegan evercore isi line openmichael lonegan evercore isi analyst yeah hi good morning thanks taking question highlighted shift timing maintenance capex look like could spend additional maintenance third quarter fourth quarter two quarter came million year versus guidance million yet reiterated maintenance capex forecast wondering could share detail thischris sotos director investor relation sure probably going get lot detail lot number immaterial overall guidance turn sarah term clarity u obviously disappointing year generation overall maintenance capex needed much due lower generation think perspective kind gave guidance maintenance capex point really look comprehensively happened availability shortfall saw kind spend dollar improve availability move think really kind lot point around maintenance capex question thought unfortunately due generation kind lower targeted maintenance capex also thereby lower really kind putting two together sarah detailssarah rubenstein chief financial officer think covered mean maybe highlight million cafd guiding includes amount would potentially decided nothing worry revising chris point think overall coming lower budget maintenance capex really reflects result michael lonegan evercore isi analyst great thank secondly reiterated still need external capital talking targeting four time corporate debt corporate ebitda wondering deploy thermal proceeds presumably organically delever balance sheet little bit wondering could say expect within leverage range low end would consider deploying excess capital target midpoint instancechris sotos director investor relation sure think couple question hopefully unpack first point though actually going rest laurel number fall given external given capital thermal actually hope better right control line sight point clarity think think overall debt billion bond deploy thermal proceeds run rate basis million cafd add back corporate interest call billion billion get four time call corporate debt corporate ebitda think question excess leverage capacity fair want pin everything one credit stat easiest one use translate yeah interest rate environment obviously thing move around think question think would thermal capital deployed low end target four also little bit fair question yes agency use number metric simplest one kind walk hopefully answered questionmichael lonegan evercore isi analyst yes thank appreciate timeoperatorthank next question come line mark jarvi cibc line openmark jarvi cibc world market analyst yes good morning everyone maybe coming back comment around thirdparty transaction might active would sort frame environment right seemed like bit buyer market last year anecdotally hearing peer thing starting pick term activity level bit competition would frame right chrischris sotos director investor relation sure think view think volatility mean well aware kind treasury moved also stock fourth quarter difficult u feel good underwriting year given volatility knowing would get accretion disciplined u also think lot seller kind waiting see market came able move forward sale think obviously kind past call month probably ish basis point year treasury volatility obviously much le experiencing fourth quarter last year perspective think overall target hopefully robust importantly ability execute think volatile market made kind execution underwriting difficult mark jarvi cibc world market analyst would think funding top ra existing commitmentschris sotos director investor relation yeah depending size obviously unfunded revolver would kind use warehouse first think previous question always kind use excess cash whenever borrow look excess cash basically pay back first excess debt capacity previous question equity last u depending capital market time size acquisition obviously significant revolver capacity forced go market certain sizemark jarvi cibc world market analyst understood look next three five year know point guy give u clarity think organic growth dropdown growth come besides anything else cafd profile related tax equity partnership like notable flip coming potential buyout anything sort change cafd profile existing asset next three five yearschris sotos director investor relation come fairly regularly like would say material driver paradigmchanging number like disclosure see u kind one year general tend pretty small question flip come tend material driver cafd long termmark jarvi cibc world market analyst ok last question obviously saw ppa price rise last couple year return objective moved higher including cafd target assuming rate plateau go lower updated term think return going trend next month seeing maybe maybe ceg level term seeing ppa price clear recently term return potentialchris sotos director investor relation craig mind speak cegcraig cornelius president chief executive officer clearway energy group sure think weighted average cost capital sponsor project owner across industry rose fiscal year broad environment industry participant factored increased weighted average cost capital price offered customer new contract price also took account equipment pricing environment pandemic change trade policy became elevated today market see ppa price remaining comparable resource start competitor think finding customer still see value elevated ppa price particular customer either load serving entity enduse customer see growing load value low emission profile product selling foresee meaningful decline ppa price today equally competitive environment see expectation dramatic increase return produced project able support higher internal rate return higher cafd yield new project creating take account elevated cost capital industry generallymark jarvi cibc world market analyst got decline ppa price would really reflective capex trend guess financing cost much sacrifice irr objectivescraig cornelius president chief executive officer clearway energy group think mean think sought disciplined need deliver accretive growth clearway energy
