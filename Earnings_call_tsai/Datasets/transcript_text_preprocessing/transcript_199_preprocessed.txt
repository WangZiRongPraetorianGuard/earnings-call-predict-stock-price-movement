harned bernstein please go aheaddoug harned alliancebernstein analyst great thank good morning would like start make sure good understanding f right tr said air force talked well look like timeline moved back point q great deal slippage timeline last year block delayed new budget cut delivery extensively avoid later block upgrade mean able keep production revenue although delivery cash payment get confident trajectory perhaps jim maybe could talk positive negative scenario might look like production delivery next two year would mean revenue cash trajectoryjim taiclet chairman president chief executive officer sure doug think important understand said earlier concurrent development production advancing sustainment capability well time complex program go period development production run largely design base engineered base aircraft supposed look like going perform f different sense development going since day program started year year ago going today good news step function increase capability every year result f capacity government came extended expected service life aircraft another decade two think good thing also extremely difficult thing even predict schedule right responsibility hold cost schedule control variable let say ok still oem still responsible run tr level complexity executing step function increase pretty would say novel dramatic team company integrating series component device software managing integrating happening ringing software new hardware integrating aircraft system taken longer team predicted way going get think release release got lot confidence stage doug release one think way calling along yous government combat trainingcapable aircraft meaning get jet hand squadron wing regional commander start training pilot training maintenance organization also getting base infrastructure spare part pool everything else sort operational shape get final software load fully combatcapable version tr sometime next month aircraft could deployed actual combat operation training maintenance bringing operational pattern procedure actually fly jet combat would like able sooner schedule would say combat trainingcapable aircraft highly confident based test result far deliverable third quarter jay want say anything else cash flow jay malave chief financial officer yes sure doug add jim mentioned combat training capability configuration jim mentioned support training squadron standing new squadron decreasing amount time aircraft parked really avoids type significant disruption really keep production track beyond well jim mentioned capability inserted actually start delivering inserting block type capability well may heard referenced comment made yous military discussed block reimagined would entail insertion schedule really tied executable plan provided industry avoid type disruption look short term could pressure lot contract profitability potential movement around cash flow yes think longer term medium term think working coordination customer make sure deliver capability customer want executable schedule able able keep program track production standpointoperatorour next question peter strauss barclays sorry david strauss barclaysdavid strauss barclays analyst good morning thanks taking question since q budget look like going get large supplemental ngi might thing together change thinking

arment robert w baird company analyst yes thanks good morning jim jay missile fire control talk maybe confidence margin guidance year given q margin performance certainly lowest seen many year know classified loss supposed expected continue got kind inflecting top line think maria called production increase loss get smaller classified going see offset higher volume maybe could give color kind expectation market performance profile going forward thanksjay malave chief financial officer sure peter mfc little light two factor first mentioned million loss provision recorded addition profit adjustment lighter yearoveryear million function really calendarization see profit adjustment throughout rest year improve getting u back guided reminder anticipating fully anticipated guidance mfc would additional could additional loss back half year associated classified program guide implies today recorded million range another million back half year would provided expectation going beyond

fara table look like flyer program decent support thinking outlook vertical lift business could see upside competition think thatjim taiclet chairman president chief executive officer yes ron jim kind roll st century company trying look thing programmatic lens call vertical kind column also horizontally actual mission figure technology accomplish mission enable core basic platform successful well looking rotary business sikorsky anymore sikorsky plus lockheed martin right one reason able work yous army congress broader yous government increase support let u say black hawk example spite fact fara canceled another vertical lift program form flraa going tiltrotor mission black hawk extremely well suited rotary lower really lower air domain rotorcraft pair rotorcraft traditional black hawk let u call modernizing black hawk digital technology air force would call collaborative combat aircraft meaning lower air domain tie drone unmanned uncrewed aircraft black hawk using digital technology demonstrated already actually make black hawk autonomous pilot flown command center highrisk mission looking mission saying across lockheed martin whether sensor fusion ai g spacebased sensor asset make black hawk example much longer live platform much relevant platform actually efficient platform compared say flraa aircraft able mission anyway strong confidence sikorsky platform produce includes chk mentioned seahawk black hawk configured maritime operation pretty high tech well feel really solid think jay said remark sikorsky future backlog billion ability modernize really reliable production aircraft new thing mission digital technology integrate part lm partner make platform relevant future stop jay anything else want sayjay malave chief financial officer sure couple thing jim mentioned stable outlook best way describe jim mentioned chk really pillar revenue going double see decline program combat rescue helicopter decline black hawk others chk really offset decline go rebalance little bit rebalance workforce mix development work versus production work different originally anticipated go think business mentioned pretty stable also jim mentioned continue dialogue investment black hawk modernization maintain relevancy particularly jadc environment course continue see opportunity base mission black hawk performs mission well dialogue ongoing army determine would best fit mentioned revenue standpoint next five year actually go next year little bit come back pretty much flat today stability think best way describe itoperatorour next question rob spingarn melius research please go aheadrob spingarn melius research analyst thank good morning jim put impact tr side last call underscored importance supply chain producing f rate one thing made f program well supported congress international country breadth supply chain complexity scale supply chain limiting potential affordability program future fighter aircraft program whether ngad faxx might expect lockheed work inhouse production work inhouse compared fjim taiclet chairman president chief executive officer great topic rob let u start origination f program intended said widebased allied program think seven literally partner essentially treaty partner going get together contribute industrial capacity financial capacity program given importance complexity scale people contemplating yes pretty broad supply chain couple time gotten little tough program covid one delayed delivery youk factory open although mitigating future program eager international production sustainment partner going expand also going apply antifragility methodology initiative going forward one really thought covid course example need know know need second maybe third source geographic diversity would positive thing perspective little broadly thoughtful single source outside yous probably best idea affordability issue around going balance everything based origination essentially commitment country program sort spread supply chain couple weak spot look another weak spot canopy right hard make glass canopy well kind stress kind precision needed put f canopy together versus f used look little bit highly complex hard produce single source one big degrader going learn whether domestic international supplier going forward addition pointed heavily insourcing lockheed martin best technology looking hard making sure control much supply chain feasible reasonable based whatever program example ngi mfc lockheed martin space collaboration make sure critical sensor component could produce company effectively efficiently one selected ok topic really great one intend actually geographically diversify supply chain really based antifragility concept two three source either different part world different company different logistical chain thing like run supply chain issue much prior program including f honestlyoperatornext question rob stallard vertical research please

vehicle relevant circumstancesjim taiclet chairman president chief executive officer yes rob maybe support another minute jay speaking direct way view may heard even costbased development project program fixed price set early production option tough thing intellectually get least arm around committing cost price object really fully invented yet looking really really hard opportunity presented u context company one area highlight jay speaking alignment industry deliver reasonable risk basis government get successful program frankly massive writeoffs industry cost overrun long schedule delay think constructive get alignment jay describedoperatorour next question george shapiro shapiro research please go aheadgeorge shapiro shapiro research analyst yes good morning couple quick one jay first quarter normalized growth even high end looking fastestgrowing quarter slows obviously normalizing fourth quarter second question guide net million first quarter negative expecting might lower number year reason lower thanksjay malave chief financial officer right george quarterly profile sale mentioned normalized basis growth first quarter would see slow low single digit second third
