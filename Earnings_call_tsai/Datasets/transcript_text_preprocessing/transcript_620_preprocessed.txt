call question question answer operatorwe begin questionandanswer session operator instruction first question come patrick ouellette stifel please go aheadgwen gresham senior vice president head investor relation good morning patrickpatrick ouellette stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning got pat steve thanks taking time could give u update competitive landscape yous property market thought potential sale dynaenergetics impact competitionlarry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah mean think crowded market way look lot entrance field think core lab perspective still maintain strong competitive edge shaped charge energetics used perforate well always wheelhouse offer competitive preassembled gun system variety product market think offer highly competitive set solution yeah dyna folk mean think question best asked good folk think may seeing reflection landscape see alternative product including core lab gaining traction chris going want add anything thatchris hill chief financial officer mean mean look outside make sense announced surprise u looking best maximize business shareholder value make sense u divesting business look like projected want go arcadia solarry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah make good product completion question highly regarded think run good shop see play outpatrick ouellette stifel financial corp analyst great ok thanks could talk margin progression reservoir description thought around potential incrementals second half larry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah think know segment highly exposed international activity see progressing call low double digit next year mean think fullyear incremental margin reservoir description pretty lofty number whether maintain exact number might little bit challenging going high modeling greater incremental margin growth incremental revenue think achievable u know always look goal getting back operating margin sort baseline would like see normal environment got kind close q timely merit increase beginning q raised labor cost felt needed done staff little bit step back think progress think dialing low doubledigit growth international applying incremental margin probably toward higher end good basis coming model forecasting reservoir description performancechris hill chief financial officer right thing would add little bit headwind u mentioned real disruption geopolitical happen difficult u adjust cost impact revenue impact margin well sometimes temporary kind manage way cost structure little bit headwindlarry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah example one thing dialed thought q saw pickup conflict russia ukraine course focus lot conflict infrastructure deal maritime transportation hydrocarbon kind think core lab maybe among peer group little bit unique exposure laboratory service needed cargo transportation kind land u bit dial thinking seeing happened red sea across russian port hard predict chris point also hard manage cost want reflexively start slashing cost going temporary disruption make right decision time keep cost aligned hard make cost adjustment real time thing unfolding unpredictable pacepatrick ouellette stifel financial corp analyst yep make sense thanks lot turn backgwen gresham senior vice president head investor relation thanks patlarry bruno chairman chief executive officer ok thanks patoperatorthe next question come crist johnson rice please go aheadgwen gresham senior vice president head investor relation hey dondon crist johnson rice company analyst good morning good morning guy commentary press release talked many middle east project kind moving implementation part world implementation standpoint ie brazil guyana really kind ramping middle far east well life cycle projectslarry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah would probably put order middle east tip spear across multiple country region would say south atlantic margin picking u would throw also west africa work well would say lagging bit asiapac although got pretty bright spot australia indonesiadon crist johnson rice company analyst ok one question yous basin mature obviously go toward know tier acreage toward tier tier life cycle particularly bakken number two permian starting get inquiry evaluate kind tier tier rock permianlarry bruno chairman chief executive officer yeah mean got multicompany study done across major unconventional basin north america many case part world got pretty good sensibility tier tier tier rock joked past sell information good stuff intermediate stuff notsogood stuff clearly progression moving toward latter stage tier tier case lower end tier rock think look production lot field one really mind got growth potential permian dial rock quality issue also thing like lateral length expansion expansion third mile oil well oilproducing well becoming common practice rock quality clearly best best either consumed rapidly depleted across basin engineering completion optimization program production enhancement group play try get rock would add little bit say see time time company taking refreshed look restimulation refracs thing like try go older legacy well try get unstimulated rock stage far apart think growth rate key point growth rate seen production north america either going continue going much slower pacechris hill chief financial officer right think fair say still real early focus capturing co becomes maybe available might opportunity better opportunity look know eortype project unconventionals availability co may limiting factor pastdon crist johnson rice company analyst right getting lot work bakken restimulate try go rock maybe stimulated first timelarry bruno chairman chief executive officer le basin say generalization would add eor program validated lab seemed work better basin part bakkendon crist johnson rice company analyst oklarry bruno chairman chief executive officer look bakken still bakken still worldclass field play stratigraphic target going lot oil coming rate growth going today going determined advancement completion technology thing like thatdon crist johnson rice company analyst right think early stage kind refrac program basin reading correctly rightlarry bruno chairman chief executive officer think think right think highly operatordependent believe would proper characterize broadbased approach among large number operator look restimulation eor areadon crist johnson rice company analyst right ok appreciate conversation turn backgwen gresham senior vice president head
