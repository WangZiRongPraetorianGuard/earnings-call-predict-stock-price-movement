investment money application engineer working customer specific application interesting driver two can one improved performance want design part machined least easily performancedriven designer seeing increase motivated risk reduction existing infrastructure like oil gas lot interest oil gas oftentimes oil rig refinery difficult part world customer forced hold huge amount inventory make sure stay running really interested localized manufacturing could justintime production spare part pursuing lot electrical infrastructure oil gas look investment require u build new plant thing lot investment except sale application development folk see increased spending around sale cost new industrial market make sensejacob stephan lake street capital market analyst yeah helpful notice sorry said insource initiative completed maybe kind give u overall progress update restructuring initiative still expect majority completed qendjeff graf president chief executive officer yeah would say would say midyear q different three leg stool restructuring straight headcount reduction course got look know north america versus europe term timing north american action completed european stuff progress

raw hardware design sale moving market moving europe moving state definitely happening like generalize much competing price hardware way strategically way compete hardware technology bringing together material software servicing customer well often struggle broadbased seeing lot entrant china hardware side make challenge strictly look hardware part pressure rd spend make sure technologically stay ahead core market stay ahead mean talking regenerative medicine know clearly ahead core industrial even healthcare market make sure stay ahead hardware software material make sure scale enough service customer sale service standpoint comment know sufficient scale spend lot money servicing customer talk consolidation industry scale help really help economically spread cost full landscape around china glad asked questionananda baruah loop capital market analyst yeah quick followup sort like present way described know past call consumerworkshop level kind approach seeing kind move sort bread butter market guess one question ask kind distinction prototyping production guess sort like context around question would great thanksjeff graf president chief executive officer well yeah sure good question clearly industrial healthcare glad healthcare business regulatory environment quality concern everything else healthcare difficult market penetrate aerospace defense think probably last market production level would exposed talking production application going working way sorry broad brush commentary working way industrial market particularly industry produce consumer product know quality important differentiator thing like working way kind consumerdriven market lighter exposure broadly still important trend continue one set initial prototyping clearly easier market lower risk get definitely definitely working industrial market beginning easier one working way harder one hopefully answer part questionananda baruah loop capital market analyst yeah absolutely appreciate context eye time leave get guy calljeff graf president chief executive officer okananda baruah loop capital market analyst thanks lotjeff graf president chief executive officer well look forward talking ananda always thanksoperatorthank next question coming james ricchiuti needham company line livejim ricchiuti needham company analyst hi good morning question asked wanted follow see get little bit color decline industrial business know quarterly level look like lowest quarter year know talked area business held better think aerospace defense semi know area particular weak quarter pronounced one geographyjeff graf president chief executive officer jim try answer pretty equal yous europe sale yous europe pretty equally split frankly central bank part world raising interest rate much consumer marketdriven consumer end marketdriven look customer industrial customer big industrial company customer industrial side serve consumer market think concern jim rapid rise interest rate consumer going able buy much need capacity like canceled order keep using phrase slowroll po know call say po yeah next week next week next week coming canceled believe coming believe continue see slow roll convinced consumer going go away closer get specialized equipment like semiconductor equipment manufacturer strong u working market long time people putting semiconductor equipment heavy industrial equipment business remains strong doubt defense aerospace remain strong go closer company make consumer product one hesitant capex spend said know industrial hung better healthcare last year healthcare dominated dental due orthodontics lot capacity printer saw rolloff printer even healthcare industrial almost offset decline new customer coming see uptick see much decline industrial side either ray sunshine somewhere probably disappointment q usually strong quarter clearly see lift usually see people hang purchase order knowjim ricchiuti needham company analyst got last question nongaap opex guiding would seem suggest pretty healthy step q know going backend loaded restructuring action takingjeff graf president chief executive officer yeah jim would say probably little bit backend loaded took lot action quickly north america launched term headcount component tricky part site closure split yous europe site closure take little bit time accounting resolution done facility
