salveen let turn stuart question vanza commercialization casgevy launch focus cmmi questionstuart arbuckle chief operating officer yes salveen answer first question vanzacaftor answer think vanzacaftor going attractive treatment option patient currently treated might want superior control cftr function patient physician know cftr function dysfunction underlying cf improve cftr function going get better clinical outcome line think going see interest currently treated also think going see lot interest patient previously discontinued one cftr modulators given profile demonstrated today casgevy couple comment really first one would make excited demo opportunity work cm state interested working cm interested outcomesbased agreement particularly see delay couple reason one already working many state medicaid agency waiting demo secure access patient covered medicaid secondly term think going complex delay negotiate outcomebased agreement really look profile casgevy incredibly strong really talking outcomesbased agreement looking whether small number patient may respond think outcomebased agreement lot uncertainty difficulty outcome metric endpoint expect particularly challengingsalveen richter goldman sachs analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come geoff meacham bank america please go aheadgeoff meacham bank america merrill lynch analyst hey guy thanks much question congrats data vanza couple question follow skyline ridgeline extension trying think pick differentiation versus trikafta term maybe exacerbation measuring pancreatic sufficiency longer period guess ultimately going know sweat chloride regularly used clinic treatment decision trying see rationale maybe switching patient away trikafta stable thank youreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer yeah hey thanks geoff reshma let take one think patient enrolled skyline trial yearolds ridgeline patient already extension study patient opportunity roll openlabel extension study like trikafta suspect right ability evaluate document overall improvement patient cf life time give sense looking say look safety table one slide unsurprisingly common one common aes patient population pulmonary exacerbation look le pulmonary exacerbation numerically safety table patient vanza patient trikafta trikafta amazing drug already documented improvement pulmonary exacerbation longerterm outcome think correct able pick longterm outcome patient followed openlabel extension study followed registry fortunate cf registry already exist vast majority patient cystic fibrosis followed registriesgeoff meacham bank america merrill lynch analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come mohit bansal well fargo please go aheadmohit bansal well fargo security analyst great thank much taking question following geoffs question commonly doctor check sweat chloride level part know diagnostic purpose check retest prescribing well something educate doctor followup actually cog charlie cost good sold think happened fourth quarter onetime movement rd cog drove something need continue modeling going forward thank youreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer hey hi mohit let ask charlie tackle cog question first come back tell sweat chloride clinical practicecharlie wagner chief financial officer yeah mohit fourth quarter casgevy approved yous started treating commercial product therefore took manufacturing cost previously recorded rd moved cost good sold manufacturing cost remain cost good sold going forwardreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer mohit regard sweat chloride measurement clinical practice correct term diagnosis patient western world diagnosed gene test genetic test oftentimes patient born people born confirmed sweat chloride test number diagnosis cf millimoles sweat chloride indeterminate le diagnosed cf metric sweat chloride measure followed routinely clinical practice physician understand well especially pulmonologists cf expert underlying disease cf dysfunction cftr protein well understood direct readout cftr protein function sweat chloride think concept well understood sweat chloride diagnosis commonly used test clinicmohit bansal well fargo security analyst got itoperatorthe next question come phil nadeau td cowen please go aheadphil nadeau td cowen analyst good afternoon let u add congratulation another positive pivotal program one sweat chloride one actually pain data released last week first sweat chloride look like trikafta get decent proportion patient millimoles per liter millimoles per liter data following patient trikafta long time show better outcome trikafta patient got low level sweat chloride presumably could extrapolate vanza triple show higher proportion patient would good outcome first question second question pain data released last week seem like bunionectomy phase trial underperformed phase previously released well abdominoplasty phase released last week anything different trial would caused act le potently prior study thanksreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer yeah phil let take bunionectomy abdominoplasty vx first come back sweat chloride know actually find remarkable phil consistently performed striking smaller difference bunionectomy readout phase phase across bunionectomy abdominoplasty look totality vx evidence easy enough structure study design similar phase phase dose high dose phase see bunionectomy abdominoplasty performed virtually identically like spid something like point something like think actual number move phase positive study placebo grand scheme thing remarkable know conduct clinical trial pain field notoriously difficult placebo effect move around significantly effect comparator group move around significantly look totality data mean looking data phase phase also mean looking spid let u focus bunionectomy bunionectomy connecting nprs remember nprs actual score feed spid integration nprs time look nprs data decrease nprs point bunionectomy point abdominoplasty start hour decrease term relative decrease look comparison norco opioid use trial number abdominoplasty bunionectomy approximately reduction term relative change put together see quite bit consistency good therapeutic effectiveness efficacy sweat chloride really really great question order sort really understand triangulate couple different data point one data point around natural history genetics disease take example patient fmf versus frf fmf patient high sweat chloride severe disease frf patient residual function patient relatively better sweat chloride level relatively le severe disease one set data point look interventional data data greatest reduction ppfev sweat chloride longterm evidence trikafta compare kalydeco example see trikafta even better kalydeco best example give rate decline trikafta realworld data rate decline show decline got trikafta could show slowed rate decline every reason world believe vanzacaftor triple used longer time point get cftr protein function higher level vanza triple given u best highestachieved cftr protein level think going see longterm benefit yes math triangulation available dataphil nadeau td cowen analyst perfect thank youoperatorthe next question come robyn karnauskas truist please go aheadrobyn karnauskas truist security analyst hi thank commercialization know really hard switching one drug next walk switching trikafta next drug like given people stable lung function great would think motivates commercial europe well yous allow people stay drug like move nextgeneration drug think coming point like remember long time ago people hard time switching one drug want understand like like actually help people help commercial organization switch one nextreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer stuartstuart arbuckle chief operating officer yeah robyn thanks must confess experience little bit different seen rapid transition medicine serially innovated delivered better better medicine even instance introduced trikafta patient kalydeco instance long time obviously kalydeco set high bar efficacy see rapid adoption trikafta even patient given clear benefit risk profile think seen relatively rapid transition medicine serially innovated interestingly design study actually give proof fact patient effectively transition trikafta vanzacaftor reshma mentioned remark design study people stable four week trikafta therapy establish baseline randomized either continue trikafta transition vanzacaftor within study realworld evidence people able transition ask think going motivate people want consider vanzacaftor triple combination think benefit risk profile able demonstrate achieving higher level sweat chloride reduction previous medicine including trikafta fact onceaday therapy said number time think profile going see lot enthusiasm cf communityrobyn karnauskas truist security analyst followup question pair government europe believe like stable level lung function trikafta think people focus like need data going forwardstuart arbuckle chief operating officer well mean think long track working payer cystic fibrosis well decade think significant amount understanding disease obviously presenting data vanzacaftor payer compliant manner right time one thing would note vanzacaftor triple combination likely indicated similar population patient trikafta think going make launch payer perspective bit different previous launch recall journey u launched orkambi moving kind singledigit number eligible patient medicine could potentially treat cf patient brought trikafta forward moving toward able treat patient vanza going likely similar label trikafta likely scary would suggest payer term big budget impact hitrobyn karnauskas truist security analyst thank muchoperatorthe next question come jessica fye jpmorgan please go aheadjessica fye jpmorgan chase company analyst great good evening thanks

taking question know lot vanza triple kind maybe walk u clinical consideration would get maybe physician switch patient thinking kind potential trikafta quitter returning drug conversation look like guess maybe specifically would patient discontinue trikafta would want reinitiate vanza triple thank youreshma kewalramani president chief executive officer sure thing evan think stuart talked maybe shorthand saying approximately patient system known cf seen cf provider used trikafta lost simply discontinued either adverse event perhaps compliance technical difficulty vanza course day see patient potentially coming back short version conversation would coming see doctor usually cf patient seen doctor quarter return conversation might something like vanza approved new drug safety efficacy want try tried medicine new one doctor patient would communication patient already trikafta well suspect going like symdeko orkambi trikafta kalydeco trikafta cf patient educated patient know clinical trial going know potential medicine might coming pike interested treated effective medicine medicine best benefit risk disease start birth entire life life expectancy based modeled data think idea get patient close normal possible least journey vanza attractive option physician patient suspect conversation going aboutoperatorthe next question come chris raymond piper sandler please go aheadchris
