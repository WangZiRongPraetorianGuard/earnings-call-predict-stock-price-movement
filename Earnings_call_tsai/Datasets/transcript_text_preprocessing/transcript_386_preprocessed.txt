know frame would greatly appreciatedsheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing yeah sheridan absolutely efficiency drawing threemile lateral well going production going see drop previous cadence capital need spend area maintain volume also remember bakken guiding little bit bcf throughput bcf processing capacity lot working leverage grow area see capital come downvrathan reddy jpmorgan chase company analyst great second one wanted hit northern border thought guy could share see dynamic playing throughout year mainly could see relief pipeline volume start flowing coastal gaslink service lng canadachuck kelley senior vice president natural gas pipeline well vrathan chuck far northern border go volume see coming today think appreciably impacted come canadian volume diverted lng canada stronghold million day held longterm producer continue flow northern border pipe remain full headed toward ventura chicago know relief gp business working deal wbi move gas cheyenne hub nice relief well probably seen information bison express coming q offer upwards another call million day relief think pipe positioned well next couple yearsvrathan reddy jpmorgan chase company analyst great thank youoperatorthe next question come spiro dounis citi please go aheadspiro dounis citi analyst thanks operator good morning everybody maybe

project think ebitda ramp three sheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing well take first part look one project think rampup mb going come full thirdparty frac capacity today going high operating rate going nice multiple said west texas expansion contracting continue contract volume acceptable return significant amount upside going forward continuing drive project multiple grow elk creek expansion probably going lowest one need whole lot volume able low multiple would get point high utilization rate multiple well onespiro dounis citi analyst ok helpful thanks sheridan maybe going back synergy sound like plus going develop new infrastructure achieve synergy curious give u sense look like storage tank connection within system sense building theresheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing yeah think going kind stuff going small relatively small capital going connection tank depending system come continue look forward achieving head time framespiro dounis citi analyst great leave thanks timeoperatorthe next question come jean ann salisbury bernstein please go aheadjean salisbury alliancebernstein analyst hi followup discussion northern border earlier understanding looking script canada actually already sort mmcfd mmcfd directly contracted think hit limit bakken gas takeaway

coming bakken absorbed bison express wbi expansionpierce norton president chief executive officer jean ann pierce based seen mean actually look well capacity today restriction today look fact know going natural gasfired generation facility going built north dakota area also look bison express also look wbi know seeing anything anywhere near future going kind restriction gas takeawaywalt hulse chief financial officer think plenty takeaway remember always lever need extract ethane put ngl pipe create capacity natural gasjean salisbury alliancebernstein analyst thank exactly looking kind followup ethane outlook sheridan talking earlier think ton new ethane demand domestically export year associated gas likely still grow outlook risk increasing rejection bakken midcon next couple year could drag ebitdasheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing potentially think get see little bit ethane export capability coming online lot really depends hard petchems running utilization big impact well think ethane rejection recovery across footprint lot depends natural gas price area feel good opportunity continue bring incentivized ethane bakken fully integrated ngl system gp system well midcontinent may see little bit swing could little bit swing ethane recovery much lower rate see coming bakken think big thing going hard petchems utilization rate seeing move operating pretty high levelsjean salisbury alliancebernstein analyst helpful thanks taking questionsoperatorthe next question come keith stanley wolfe research please go aheadkeith stanley

gathering processing would say right going comment specifically refined product movement specific pipeline say ngl pipeline moved refined product fourth quarter first quarter see movement two pricing mechanism gulf group seen opportunity longerhaul tariff refined product systemtheresa chen barclays analyst ok sheridan going back butane blending synergy comment rvp requirement butane blending needing come gasoline pool midapril time frame given comment downstream customer lack octane gasoline pool switch happens lend opportunity isobutane volume feedstock alkylate said differently acquired magellan refined product asset exposure gasoline float create uplift even heavier component ngl barrelssheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing yeah could potential look know natural gasoline component barrel blending unleaded pool looked term isobutane specifically going alkylate servicing alkylate unit quite long time legacy ngl business typically know alkylate high priced usually run pretty strong big difference alkylate unit whether going run refinerygrade propylene unit going stay rgbs refinerygrade butane run well see propylene run alkylate unit see little bit isobutane used typically run pretty steadytheresa chen barclays analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come tristan richardson scotiabank please go aheadtristan richardson scotiabank analyst hey good morning guy maybe question west texas expansion talked optionality final looping complete maybe little bit timing progress decision service put legacy pipe crude refined

side good possibility want keep ngl service continue able service downstream asset mont belvieu area would decide shift product big thing going determined way run obviously want run mont belvieu west texas take u little bit time little bit work header system side want another product moving west texas mont belvieu houston area would quicker pump already set going direction moment right probably leaning toward natural gas liquid side raw feed side continue see good growth coming permiantristan richardson scotiabank analyst appreciate sheridan maybe walt curious talked couple question thinking three major project coming implies future capex certainly implies future free cash flow talk think get maybe higher end lower end capital return percent walt hulse chief financial officer well clearly

dingmann truist security analyst got make sense ok quick followup like slide show synergy opportunity wondering batch batching upside laid slide wondering timingwise quickly wondering thinking key area anticipate seeing majority batching upsidesheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing well batching think really going see lot throughout system already happening today happen throughout opportunity see already connectivity system continue grow continue bring asset together see opportunity central system see opportunity gulf coast see opportunity even much line west texasneal dingmann truist security analyst thank look forward upsideoperatorthe next question come craig shere tuohy brother please go aheadcraig shere tuohy brother analyst good morning thanks taking question capex opportunity could opine possibility needing another frac mmp acquisition increase prospect accretively rebuilding andor repurposing legacy medford frac sitesheridan sword senior vice president natural gas natural gas gathering processing sheridan yeah think mmp affect really affect medford think increased frac capacity need really looking right bottleneck throughout system get lowcost expansion existing fracs continue look medford type capacity could get medford low cost bringing part portion back whole facility damaged fire certain part think opportunity little bit le capacity low dollar per barrel capacity see next really growth fractionation capacity coming really see mmp acquisition big impact thatcraig shere tuohy brother analyst great last question synergy sound like expect almost full million ga benefit would suggest know might conservative commercial side fair assessmentkevin burdick executive vice president chief
