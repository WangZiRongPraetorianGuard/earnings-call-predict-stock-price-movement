brian lee goldman sachs please go aheadbrian lee goldman sachs analyst hey everyone good afternoon thanks taking question appreciate additional color granularity providing uncertain environment know sound like pretty confident q could bottom undershipping le q q significantly magnitude q based early read want ask like given seasonality early read revenue q view q kind bottom like directionally give u sense back low mid million revenue range even something higher directional feel provide kind magnitude pickup q bottom followupbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right tell big picture basically told two problem one channel full problem channel inventory problem native demand problem demand reduction let u say overall high expect end customer demand roughly range million million told last time close q end customer demand q end customer demand approximately million q end customer demand approximately million know number much lower compared number said plan ship million undership million compared end customer demand end customer demand million q undershipped approximately million reported number million million minus million expect sellthrough demand going seasonally approximately q typical expect undershipment million two undershipments would taken million channel expect going forward q expect nothing happens seasonally better u since taken lot inventory channel start approach negative demand million depending much residue undershipment q tell exact number generally expect sellin number improve go q expect sellthrough number seasonally better approach q thing favor seeing europe mean europe dropped quite low level seeing europe starting pick back seeing france back level seeing netherlands although netherlands back original level far original level see incremental progress weekly basis addition introduced last six month several new product italy youk sweden denmark bunch country start see also kicking far noncalifornia state concerned already said q stable noncalifornia compared q think noncalifornia state also bounce back q telling number gave directional indication expect sellin number go north assumption sellthrough behaves according typical seasonality pattern seen california course wild card think even taking account expect expect sellin number revenue number go higher sequentially qbrian lee goldman sachs analyst appreciate super helpful second question pas battery storage segment look mix bit heavy battery q versus q overall ex ira margin still holding steady based guidance almost seems like already seeing better margin battery near term know alluded expansion year kind give u sense quantification another number question guess kind today cadence could look like battery seems like going move needle lot trying get sense margin expansion opportunity could move next several quarter thank youbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right one thing say script say sellthrough battery q highest ever megawatt hour sellthrough q sellin might ask sellin lagging behind would like get channel low possibly therefore getting conservative guided want channel get cleaned driving sellthrough ask answer obvious based said california told sellthrough increased california due nem attach california number q q q q also seeing good momentum europe introduced battery multiple region introduced june introduced australia september introduced youk introduced bunch country along breaking december launched italy start shipping soon battery demand happy say robust plan basically course plan improve gross margin gross margin three thing gross margin obvious first two applicable thirdgeneration battery last one applicable fourthgeneration battery cell pack cost coming rapidly supplier offering competitive pricing cell pack definitely moving needle one number two u specifically transforming supply chain make microinverters battery yous assembly battery china give u bestinclass supply chain

generation fourthgeneration battery thirdgeneration battery six microinverters battery management board couple board communication board interface board nine board nine board go three board integrating battery management making power conversion lot power going total three board nine becoming three power electronics therefore cost bill material dropping significantly basically form factorwise drop power electronics two inverter side two side cell pack therefore form factor certainly becomes elegant form factor becomes elegant fourth generation cost also lower along taking advantage cell pack cost plus dc plus microinverter assembly mean microinverter manufacturing yous encouraged gross margin battery continuously go north u think reflect positively overall gross marginsoperatorthe next question come colin rusch oppenheimer please go aheadcolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy talk little bit opex compensation plan going forward obviously lower nongaap number talked higher charge something thinking goforward basis something else going attending tobadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah let give color mandy add december basically announced restructuring affected workforce time running opex run rate approximately million million per quarter desire drop nongaap opex level million million number second half change lot eliminated bunch spending came people forced take action people front well largely behind u taken mandy talk charge taking gaap etc largely behind u issued k december addition time announced shutting romania well wisconsin make sense u million microinverters per quarter meaning capacity therefore worked contract manufacturer fair therefore essentially reduced capacity approximately seven announced change well mandy elaborate mandy yang chief financial officer sure yes opex reduced nongaap opex reduced million q right million q right restructuring effect come effect q q right throughout reducing discretionary spend right also hiring freeze right even attrition backfill backfill critical one right got opex reduce million million right december implemented restructuring plan right reduced worldwide headcount employee contractor right restructuring action completed q would million million run rate quartercolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst ok super helpful pricing perspective talked kind select discount folk past give u sense trending even list price stable sort discount offer folk sort dynamic around evolution product driving incremental price benefit companybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer said last quarter say ever since took always special pricing adjustment business process manage tightly across company notably much change general pricing environment kind obvious see based gross margin welloperatorthe next question come julien dumoulinsmith bank america please go aheadjulien dumoulinsmith bank america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon thanks team nice inflection term million shipment q talk little bit plan scale billion capacity obviously issued k kind bringing overall manufacturing talk anticipate ramping maybe tandem implicit see underlying demand trending visavis kind returning million back say million youbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right set context shipped approximately unit yous factory q going back q first question answer answer one basically focused inventory term dollar gross value inventory million million roughly think inventory high corresponds day inventory think think number day inventory high going war path reduce bestinclass level consider bestinclass level day north star going back day mean going ensuring unnecessary manufacturing based first priority get set boat right said ok first half year would essentially whatever take clear factory inventory clear channel expect lower shipment first half second half demand approach let u say example talked million level corresponds approximately threepointsomething million microinverters expect twothirds microinverters made yous example get back million run rate whenever maybe talking million million microinverters expect thing twothirds united state strong function demand balance factory inside outside balancing twothirdsonethird rightjulien dumoulinsmith bank america merrill lynch analyst right maybe corresponding followup briefly million undership think split yous europe talked twothirdsonethird think undership dynamic inventory today maybe prospectivelybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah q would say roughly would say q yous europe think q tilted toward youseuropeoperatornext question come philip shen roth mkm please go aheadphilip shen roth mkm analyst hi everyone thanks taking question highlighted think destocking end q prior talked destocking ending end q also end probability confidence call destocking truly end end q know answer different yous market versus europe impact meaningful shutdown bankruptcy impact guy confidence ability say q talking million million normalized run rate adt solar shut suntuity infinity vision dynamic number million million back q last year q call company talking going away shutting impacted guy assume others pick volume also watching closely happens sunpower situation go negative thought impact thanksbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah far channel concerned october call quite clear said expect undership q well q right time correct say could normalize q executed said q million said million expect million expect muchreduced level undershipment q expect million q expect muchreduced level think problem go away u q conservative tell end q sticking next one bankruptcy bankruptcy affect bankruptcy definitely causing friction short term think happen industry resilient happens end customer demand change therefore matter time unfortunate happen however readily picked might take quarter long end customer demand stay think installers pick diverse group installers work almost installers yous lot redundancy correct cause shortterm friction think soon disappearphilip shen roth mkm analyst got thanks think difference yous european market think talk destocking situation think done blended basis across country region feel feel like better faster recovery yous europe thanksbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer think least data forecasting calculation today show europe recover little bit earlier end q think see europe little better yous think normalized qoperatorthe next question come mark strouse jpmorgan please go aheadmark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst yes good afternoon thanks taking question kind followup phils question wondering dig bit netherlands mentioned think said still weak getting little bit better every week talking customer field expectation far timing certainty policy followup thanksbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah basically netherlands tell story netherlands essentially happened three four – actually six month ago would say six month ago end consumer demand started go kicked one energy company charging export penalty solar company name vandebron caused lot fear customer customer facing certainly worried export penalty solar also netherlands situation net metering clear going end going continue meeting net metering actually underway speak right new government u hear soon kicked new year january second week solar next event netherlands hosted installers came across country also hosted bunch energy provider also hosted even transmission transmission line operator basically talk agreed netherlands need comprehensive solution consists solar plus battery energy management software help unlock full potential market netherlands got roughly million home today million home solar worry solar producing home cause excessive export unmanaged intelligent energy management addition battery turn quickly turn positive every home solar plus kilowatthour battery energy management software payback still fine six eight year painted picture general alignment stakeholder following webinars actual execution solargraf tool example select homeowner basically understand value proposition lot better addition situation net metering starting get start get clear next week would say netherlands think saw bottom bottom think bottom talked solar plus battery also seeing attach rate battery netherlands predict pickup solar battery course crystal ball could wrong think net metering decision come big deal general alignment energy provider long dynamic tariff would export penalty need battery manage dynamic tariff gave long answer short think bottom think behind u see steady uptick theremark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst ok helpful badri thank real quick followup know break exactly country country given put take france netherlands germany new country entering generic guideline provide street far kind major country let u say netherlands france germany might represent business todaybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer usually break order significance least overall revenue netherlands followed france followed germany obviously heard situation netherlands think like said soon bounce back far france concerned see steady demand france utility rate increasing france therefore mean already increased last year expected increase year think general positive france actually growing france flat right expect grow given normal seasonality germany tricky germany u hit lot inventory problem destocking strong partner lot distributor buying various region europe shipping product germany one trend seeing activation every week monitor many system got connected cloud whether solar plus storage etc quite well activation increasing quarter quarter clearly installers little conservative holding le inventory basically installing enphase see play play next two market care lot italy youk italy basically got roughly gigawatt solar attach battery gridtied battery singlephase market introduced iq microinverter launched battery well december expect start shipping battery italy imminently quarter youk one big market megawatt solar attach rate storage entered market september expect continuously grow five big market u europe little one course spain austria switzerland working improving microinverters battery greece poland enter country europe country already battery sweden denmark forgot sweden denmark battery attach sweden denmark particularly nice last week month optimistic sweden denmark represents nice opportunity well want add anything raghuraghu belur chief product officer yes think trend look mentioned addition market transitioning already transitioned solar solar plus battery mean energy management software becomes critical element deliver whatever use case homeowner desire dynamic tariff mentioned netherlands really prove requires sophisticated software manage dayahead tariff hourly dayahead tariff bring tremendous amount value homeowner example dynamic tariff environment could negative pricing mean negative pricing get paid charge battery charge ev turn heat pump addition lot market seeing grid service program also come effect pay lot money example netherlands market solar gigawatt grid gigawatts solar another eight nine gigawatts wind imbalance issue imbalanced market participate get paid either charging battery discharging battery similarly market frequency regulation market participate provide good value homeowner battery basically generating money thing capacity market youk also good market participate grid service seeing move solar plus battery plus energy management plus grid service compelling movement value creation homeowner trend going see happening happening worldwideoperatorthe next question come praneeth satish well fargo please go aheadpraneeth satish well fargo security analyst thanks good evening metric gave battery sellthrough megawatt hour quite high guess look second half year got nem fully swing netherlands bounce back expect battery shipment increase sequentially quarter think possible get megawatt hour battery shipment end yearbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer crystal ball generally yespraneeth satish well fargo security analyst ok fair enough guess second question ci market wondering could give u update iqp introduction progressing whether would see meaningful revenue year whether eventbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer see meaningful revenue year however let step back tell product raghu talk little introduced product fourth quarter december watt threephase volt market primarily addressing yous think estimate market size approximately one gigawatt basically help u service kilowatt installation talking example could school could hospital could gas station could motel basically small business kilowatt talking product called iqp generates watt ac service watt dc panel got rapid shutdown per panel monitoring course highest quality level year warranty till longtail installers asking u product expect quality residential product therefore asking u able service addition also solargraf software design proposal software commercial installation ship ship nontrivial amount unit already q however understand business got little bit longer time projectbased business therefore multiple party play building owner assigns program manager basically employ installer sale little bit longer compared residential sale take u time establish pipeline know product good product high quality like said expect get fair share market also expect shipment channel continuously quarter quarter yearoperatorthe next question come eric stine craighallum please go aheaderic stine craighallum capital group analyst hi everyone pretty clear commentary second half expecting get somewhat back normal sellin undershipment starting go away curious think longer term mean see scenario get back think mentioned million type level potentially mean market even inventory channel cleared think growth possible higher interest rate environment think thing know guide think thing get first second half badri kothandaraman president chief executive officer mean whole point starting diversify product portfolio rapidly planning introduce already introduced iq microinverters country last year u seen result yet inventory channel lean start see result country one plan introduce even number country still lot market europe nordic untapped going introduce microinverters addition also country asia going introduce see next battery come battery battery already talked sellthrough continuously increasing already talked product introduction place like australia youk italy place big going introducing battery place well india big untapped market example many place asia well even would say latin america example got lot country need solar storage focused multiple country solar plus storage addition talked europe talked social housing balcony solar social housing example apartment complex well row house netherlands picture house small system three kilowatt six panel sixpanel system microinverters shine come small system balcony solar another example country like germany italy austria allow export energy grid basically watt export grid plan basically leverage market well megawatt market help u address megawatt addition thing talked ev charger planning introduce ev charger lot country europe know europe forefront electric vehicle ev example youk netherlands germany france product third quarter shipping additionally bidirectional ev charger bidirectional ev charger yes argue price ev charger bidirectional charger sudden value lot higher already working ganbased bidirectional charger interface car battery around volt dc convert dc ac plug plug right ensemble energy management system consists solar home battery talked microinverters talked battery usual market going many country talked social housing balcony solar talked ev charger europe well bidirectional charge overall last one software going energy management software aibased software production consumption forecasting make right decision particularly come serving market dynamic tariff imbalance going worth quite bit customer expect fair share course always looking increase revenue per home focus lot revenue front u need execute oneric stine craighallum capital group analyst ok thanks detailoperatorthe next question come christine cho barclays please go aheadchristine cho barclays analyst good evening thank taking question wanted get color netherlands dynamic rate curious way structuring rate sort risk homeowner might elect take battery solar system play arbitrage rate could give u idea much better payback solar plus storage versus storage dynamic rate structure thing progressing real reason anyone would buy solar system without battery pointbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah look intent dutch market really focused converting renewables see solar plus battery predominant market course may corner case may see people purely arbitrage purpose primarily see market battery get associated solar could battery plus solar sorry solar plus battery plus ev charger plus heat pump managed badri mentioned artificial intelligence machine learningbased energy management software see future system would solar would storage solar well expect always energy system transition netherlands market would also undergo quickly managing dynamic tariff need sophisticated software dayahead market rate going change hourly basis need good forecasting production well consumption need able manage need able steer hey going charge battery going discharge battery going charge ev soon going able discharge ev manage heat pump buy sell energy grid done sophisticated software layer top grid service participation imbalanced market direction entire dutch market move toward always solar key element intentraghu belur chief product officer right add little bit solar plus battery selfconsumption payback let u say world without net metering payback around eight nine year add saving due dynamic tariff battery help battery well solar help manage situation reduce payback year imbalance also capability imbalance management also capability reduce payback year two get nice payback six year six seven year solar plus battery software give good payback good thing net metering number get even betterchristine cho barclays analyst ok part issue slowdown california recovery california installers know install battery california home bigger suppose rule around battery placement also add complexity netherlands home much smaller understand rule lax around permitting solar imagine going different storage think actual installation battery easier le obstacle california given think really outage think battery installation primarily load shiftingbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer exactly meaning many outage netherlands right look many country europe talk gridtype battery battery need backup course offer backup well customer want customer asking gridtype battery gridtype battery simpler sense need backup panel like installing solar gridtype battery path power like solar want backup insert switch utility home required simply economical place essentially store energy discharge use later yes mean also home small rightly pointed battery size may five kilowatt sweet spot could something like fivekilowatt hour battery installation attach rate netherlands could high fivekilowatt hour big dent pocket enough basically energy company feel happy ok customer way manage export solar time unmanaged fashion operatorthe next question come jordan levy truist please go aheadjordan levy truist security analyst good afternoon thanks detail maybe start quickly yous battery manufacturing side may touched get sense think trending margin battery side versus micros start bring yous manufacturing capacity later yearbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah today mean today supply chain predominantly china assemble battery going forward supply chain two path one still one bestinclass cost structure basically assembly battery china microinverters made united state help u microinverters made entire battery assembled yous including microinverters obviously latter one plan third quarter course customer especially tpo customer benefit getting additional itc long meet domestic content requirement plan meet expect get expect slight premium compensate cost assembly yous think either way path similar gross margin mind continuously improve cell pack get lower cost microinverters manufactured yousjordan levy truist security analyst appreciate quick followup along line big pioneer increasing yous manufacturing capacity question come probably lot next month le election november wanted get thought relates existential threat ira component ira approach electionbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah obviously crystal ball predict going win election extent think matter end day creating job investment done given factory two factory yous south carolina well texasoperatorthe next question come kasope harrison piper sandler please go aheadkasope harrison piper sandler analyst good afternoon thank taking question first one quick followup comment badri made earlier think said half activation january nem balance nem give u sense nem mix sellthrough q expect nem backlog run completelybadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah mean leaned little bit gave number january correspond say system activation one even sellthrough happens distributor sell installers activation mean installers finish installation go roof gave see home coming enlighten software platform able clearly say many nem many nem january nem therefore nem ask ratio prior quarter know guess approximately nem nem prior quarter q q expect like kasope harrison piper sandler analyst got helpful quick followup question discussion distributor indication whatsoever may want hold le inventory hand moving forward versus eight week used previously really root question stem fact lot shipping bunch stuff yous india longer lead time given going across ocean change texas south carolina ramp become twothirds shipment wondering simplistically shorter lead time mean le inventory distributor perspectivebadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer correct mean end day look mean need end customer demand end day distributor definitely critical part equation need end customer demand anything shortens cycle time actually good u anything compress overall cycle time yous manufacturing good u inventory lot money think pointed net positive u come thisoperatorthe next question come andrew percoco morgan stanley please go aheadandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst great thanks much taking question maybe maybe elaborate give u update sunpower contract exclusivity think set end end march could provide update term negotiation going maybe baked guidance term run rate revenue relates contractbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah mean enjoyed contract sunpower last five year almost going come close q course discussion leave want comment revenue comment revenue associated one customer like discussion confidential something get finalized knowandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst ok fair enough maybe one housekeeping item badri think prepared remark mentioned customer nem using battery think also said industry data showing battery attach rate close maybe comment driving delta maybe get higher attach rate battery specifically nem customersbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer right basically right general attach rate nem solar system according industry data attachment solar system past nem example nem increased make sense add battery said sellthrough number became higher improved compared prior quarter question enphase market share enphase solar installation enphase battery customer choice accoupled system therefore battery tie accoupled system however situation still net positive u battery attach battery attach rate constantly working data getting raghu belur chief product officer think lot work improving product look term existing installation commissioning serviceability etc r get better r get even better including simple product install badri mentioned form factor make much easier install win rest business go continue make hardware product improvement also software improvement making mean win businessoperatorthe next question come joseph osha guggenheim partner please go aheadjoseph osha guggenheim partner analyst thanks everyone two quick question first talking storage used talk lot commissioning challenge time seems like gotten better wondering look developer think cost installation difficulty explaining thing consumer think real biggest challenge right term selling storage especially californiabadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah mean battery hard sell first add cost system mean high interest rate environment people think twice adding second battery messy like example full backup plan properly shortchange design highquality product power go battery battery company utility company battery tough properly also problem battery servicing tough get wall ship installer installer contact supplier supplier ship replacement installer come back installers difficult truck roll many truck roll battery inverter solar tried thirdgeneration battery battery sale picking tried take account first commissioning experience lot simpler hour commission second want use battery gridtype environment even simpler used backup third one important one time battery serviced situ situ mean wall battery still wall mean common problem see rarely see problem cell pack problem commonly see battery management power electronics u serviceable board mean board get new board come field service people enphase field service people basically take installers especially critical timeline want installer service want company responsible enphase issue take care installers sell serviceability becoming big differentiator thirdgeneration battery one shipping today volume best class commissioning quality battery serviceability battery modularity five kilowatt hour lfp battery lithiumion phosphate ul better battery frontsraghu belur chief product officer also design proposal tool solargraf upfront allows installer good design whatever homeowner expectation term payback period upfront cost etc really finetune design solar plus battery system generate proposal take step single singleline diagram permit plan third generation everything tool endtoend solution providing homeowner everything design installation ease installation visibility really good customer service going take broad widescale adoption battery seeing happening think reflected number sharedjoseph osha guggenheim partner analyst ok followon guess question stipulating fixed product issue clearly need kind augmented effort educate dealer maybe bring back fold gotten finger burned trying sell battery past saying hey got good product trust u enoughbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yes absolutely enough lot event netherlands got done higher frequency nem experience telling u need help whatever way going exactly sale mean team actually listening installers salesperson lot term simplifying software really make sure selling kitchen table becomes lot easier going next monthsoperatorthe next question come gu richard northland please go aheadgus richard northland security analyst yes thanks taking question first gross

next couple quarter impact gross margin mebadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah talked three thing battery refresh cell pack cost coming microinverters going made america go battery supply chain going become best class third first two battery third specifically fourth generation improved architecture integrating power conversion battery management three initiative take battery gross margin nice fashion one talked ganbased product u gan essentially looking release nextgeneration inverter called iq iq point thinking two power flavor approximately watt ac watt ac challenge u challenge team basically get cost structure watt product actually smaller product shipping today iqa product think possible one particular innovation along gan something called bd bidirectional gan today use four silicon transistor output stage go two gan fet bidirectional therefore gan actually even gan transistor overall cost transistor may silicon even case gan come lot advantage like example transformer become lot smaller run fet higher frequency general inverter get smaller challenge u pack power watt power form factor iq reduced cost structure compared iq allow u make lot money plus make inverter yousoperatorthe next question come moses sutton bnp paribas please go aheadmoses sutton exane bnp paribas analyst hi thanks squeezing badri sellthrough channel correction point well answer phil thought still shifting demand look like look frontend data still state demand still dropping real time like even january pricing loan lease inflected least changed inflect organic market growth pull together thinking comment specifically hbadri kothandaraman president chief executive officer yeah mean look know seasonality factor noncalifornia state fact matter least data noncalifornia state look q versus q flat term microinverters think bounce back coming seasonality think already talked put take europe think europe also move continuously bottom right california course wildcard see think downside limited told revenue nem system roughly time nem system u considering attach seeing think general course could wrong q recover seasonally seen pastmoses
