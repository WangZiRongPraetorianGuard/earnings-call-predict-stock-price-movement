contract microsoft talk know use leverage system seeing kind attack market grow backup power market even know offthegrid solution data center stuffandy marsh chief executive officer look three major data center operator plug engaged planning going call initial deployment test rapid next year two certainly restriction diesel engine mentioned know want make sure continuous uptime look plug developed premier product one going requirement able operate data center big challenge one working making sure manage hydrogen know know really working customer really use product backup power system also able peak load shaving think combination two really allow market grow think event think could late event start seeing deployment little level scale know know spent lot time developed rather comprehensive marketing approach one leading firm consulting firm world know hydrogen anyone else told market ultimately become dominant market going take bitmanav gupta ubs analyst perfect andy quick clarification multiple call last two time indicated whole bunch unplanned outage within hydrogen industry restricting supply headwind thirdquarter margin also headwind fourthquarter margin also indicated thing improving get january assume least unplanned downtime gone supply ramping shortfall would better addressed enter andy marsh chief executive officer answer question yes look network

something able wrap q certainly end q leveraging work done given timing loan guarantee program timing think get nepa done feel good really able collaborate department energy especially landmark project like texas using wind power right using know going one largest liquid green hydrogen plant actually match everything talking term additionality know renewable energy credit know ppa place wind energy perspective going megawatt electrolyzer plus ton liquid fire first green hydrogen plant probably lump sum turnkey epc contract feel craig feel pretty good process need done really leveraging work done past really primary focus right nowcraig irwin roth mkm analyst excellent question sure answer going try anyway top mind lot people right doe loan fund project cost maybe give u color sort
