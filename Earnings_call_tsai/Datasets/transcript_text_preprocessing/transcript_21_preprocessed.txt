ianian thornton vice president investor relation thank jason move qa portion call request limit one question everyone get chance ask pressing question time allows go around hand back operator question answer operatorcertainly operator instruction please limit one question rejoin queue please stand compile qa roster one moment first question first question come ross seymore deutsche bank line open ross seymore deutsche bank analyst hi guy thanks asking question congrats strong result guide rene question infrastructure business specifically cloud side rattled number disparate design win starting ramp number hyperscaler customer really wondering ipo process talked market share market rising roughly think said product occurring launched contemplating original ramp seeing acceleration beyond growth rate laid u ipo processrene haas chief executive officer would say still confident number ross would say one dynamic changed bit since chatted think positive u increased investment data center around thing ai bodes well arm couple reason first think power efficiency required data center implementation armbased design get interesting relative building custom chip power efficient designing blade interconnecting storage overall rack much power efficient secondly think chatted ipo process grace hopper think nvidias recent announcement grace blackwell going see acceleration arm data center ai application one benefit get term designing chip grace blackwell integrating arm cpu nvidia gpu able get interconnect cpu gpu allows much higher access memory one limiting factor training inference application conventional system might connect x externally pcie bus much slower using custom bus nvidia example like nvlink get much higher memory bandwidth think going mean arm adoption data center increase probably faster number indicated saying anything official right nowross seymore deutsche bank analyst thank youoperatorone moment next question next question come vivek arya bank america security line openvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks much question v conversion look slide chart presentation show took seven year v become half base rene expect v conversion seems gotten faster gate conversion year assumption conversion look like fiscal think jason said mid growth royalty imply level conversion exiting yearrene haas chief executive officer yeah let jason touch conversion rate say high level different v v back conversion v v really infrastructure business speak today v going growth driver saw term conversion v v see v v smartphone business seeing fairly rapid acceleration premium handset segment moving v think pretty well documented premium handset business enjoyed probably better growth segment accelerated well two driver v look think bit different v happen quickly let jason comment think potential exit rate might particularly applies yearonyear revenue growth projectionjason child chief financial officer yes would say basis point growth percentage total going last quarter recent quarter think pretty steady clip could plus minus somewhere around basis point share growth per quarter probably reasonable assumption put probably somewhere two threeyear time frame probably get high end probably somewhere maybe around still going v v even see growth v adoption keep mind think talked back ipo even last quarter also see increased royalty almost double v go subsystem start see subsystem come online end year back half year start take hold next year also probably somewhere kind three fouryear time frame becoming large share royalty reason high confidence royalty forecast pretty strong kind approaching range year comevivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thank youoperatorand one moment next question next question coming matt ramsay td cowen line open matt ramsay td cowen analyst thank much everybody good afternoon rene wanted follow little bit infrastructure business question ross sort started one question getting folk see clearly thing like grace hopper grace blackwell accelerants pulling arm data center announced amazon google microsoft design win thing flip side accelerated data center look percentage capex go cpu versus accelerator accelerator portion going vast majority seems like trend accelerating pretty rapidly maybe could speak little bit arm role head node accelerated server across accelerator portion sort exciting growth capex rene haas chief executive officer yeah thanks matt question think go back original design win hyperscalers aws graviton one benefit talked specifically term using arm performance per dollar performance per dollar metric becomes increasingly important talk large capex spends manage cpu gpu balance think candidly also going tailwind growth u get better tco chip standpoint term performance per dollar launching aws example moment built chip called nitro based arm storage offload combine nitro soc graviton soc ec compute rack potentially configure acceleration going give pretty compelling cost advantage versus competition think candidly tradeoff question term going ai think market share think going tailwind arm standard device configure something fairly interesting start imagine anyone want custom implementation greatly enhance interconnect feature talked get interesting arm allows flexibility way alternative way alternative architecture incumbent today importantly arm done work partner relative running boot code system interface everything booting operating system extremely well positioned well platform think short summary think everything described actually going quite good u think growth number market share data center probably better originally articulatedmatt ramsay td cowen analyst thank muchoperatorand one moment next question next question come mehdi hosseini susquehanna international group line openmehdi hosseini susquehanna international group analyst yes sir thanks taking question want go back fiscal year color specifically licensing assume licensing mix rebounded second half fiscal year going driven smartphone customer renewing armv going broadbasedjason child chief financial officer would expect broadbased mentioned going mostly q mean going biggest license quarter year definitely focus ai focus ai capability really different end market serve expect quite broadbased mehdi hosseini susquehanna international group analyst smartphone royalty kick smartphone shipment calendar year jason child chief financial officer well first subsystem start launch basically last quarter year see q guess would calendar q rene haas chief executive officer yeah time license technology time see royalty probably two three year best case confidence level term royalty growth quite high contract done know rate know market share etc new design matt question earlier ross trying develop soc going fit server need run linux need run suse kubernetes etc etc really one choice arm trying build soc run window one choice arm trying build soc run android gemini one choice arm confidence term licensing happening extremely high tricky part always term visibility whether license signed december th january th move across quarter boundary term confidence going happen extremely high choice rather limited want participate market add factor onto window copilot thing gemini android seeing accelerating effort licensee able get access nextgeneration technology take advantage new ai featuresmehdi hosseini susquehanna international group analyst thank youoperatorthank one moment next question friendly reminder please limit one question next question come charles shi needham company charles line opencharles shi needham company analyst thank much good afternoon question maybe little bit backwardlooking question got quite frequently last quarter royalty revenue growth seen december quarter obviously see another strong sequential growth march december quarter since already disclosed much royalty revenue coming related party proxy arm china notice arm china actually driver royalty revenue growth december least sequential basis outside china probably like ish sequential growth wonder guy use opportunity clarify driving sequential china royalty revenue growth december quarter kind give u breakdown march quarter one either china nonchina driving sequential growth thank youjason child chief financial officer sure jason take question first would say little bit recovery china handset market year year going back december quarter little bit general market bigger impact would say mix shift chinese consumer buying would say oems partner revenue based customer based partner effectively sold product basically transfer chinese customer buying chinese producer versus someone outside china show royalty perspective shift rest world related party way related party mostly china party well term march quarter end see similar trend rest world accelerate mean saw pretty significant royalty acceleration back q q broadbased increase across world going see acceleration also china really factor saw back q wellcharles shi needham company analyst got may ask quick clarification jason talk acceleration percentage mean year year q q thank jason child chief financial officer year yearoperatorone moment next question next question come toshiya hari goldman sachs line opentoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst hi thank much taking question relatively shortterm question june quarter outlook royalty business maybe one jason based comment think royalty assuming something like sequential decline revenue given v v transition would think blended royalty rate continues grow nicely unit must maybe double digit q q think typical seasonality sequentially look business past couple year guess question driving sequential decline know coming really high base curious assuming whether smartphone market big driver thank youjason child chief financial officer sure driver sequential decline really u looking combination seeing partner forecast either good faith estimate actually disclosed publicly look across mean know big player look across different market basically seeing pretty significant decline weakness specifically would say networking industrial iot think mobile side thing pretty consistent growth overall still much positive kind ish range coming kind bottom year ago year year look little le significant last quarter see partner end seeing different impact course flow royalty perhaps may upside seeing right obviously let know see end quartertoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst jason clarify fair say automotive iot relative underperformer june client infrastructure relatively resilient fair statementjason child chief financial officer yes think generally righttoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst ok thank youoperatorthank one moment next question next question come ananda baruah loop capital line openananda baruah loop capital market analyst guess maybe rene would love get thought pc potential next year handful year client given work various folk ecosystem dealing seems lot really interesting reciprocity going thought potential would great thanksrene haas chief executive officer yeahs thanks question obviously working window ecosystem long time apple ecosystem completely converted think growth talking window think next number year positive growth potential think one thing needed pc industry grow particularly window arm segment going diversification supplier base provide multiple unit multiple skus multiple price point multiple experience end consumer everything hearing say going multiple supplier serve market next month think time next two three year arm ecosystem take significant level market share primarily level experience seen ecosystem fantastic performance great battery life fact build highperformance machine minus fan think thing going add significant growth think vendor base diversifies think going see growth start kick next monthsananda baruah loop capital market analyst yeah really great context thanks lot really appreciate itrene haas chief executive officer welcome operatorand one moment next question next question come gary mobley well fargo security gary line open gary mobley well fargo security analyst hey guy thanks taking question fiscal year done grown licensing revenue rate prior two year well predicting ipo roadshow seemingly predicting longterm growth new longterm target think term license revenue growth related highlight converted half top customer ata licensee hard convert halfrene haas chief executive officer thanks question way think licensing revenue right nice upside continues strong indication get looking forward see anything would stop licensing activity positive momentum reason mentioned trying enter market requiring ai b require rich application ecosystem support c broad o support logical choice partner arm reason confident continue maintain sustain level momentum think term percentage customer ultimately move ata estimation probably customer base point time give u lot increased predictability term license renewal much renew probably important anything term going forward jason refer second part questionjason child chief financial officer well let u see ata sure caught note increase ata partner added little roughly half would say least top would say happy look next year even versus thought ipo thought would probably closer yearonyear growth royalty expecting kind full industry kind correction turn industrial iot networking quite even though taking royalty little bit able take license even royalty reduction mostly rene talked specifically demand additional licensing capability much related ai term new normal would say license deal least certainly large atas high conversion royalty especially larger kind mature company typically pretty good turning design win turning royalty deal v higher royalty rate older counterpart would expect talked back ipo would get next couple year get royalty plus total revenue much still expectation would say starting see get deeper v penetration life cycle also see compute subsystem start come online even higher royalty rate end year give u great setup would say much higher mix royalty go next yeargary mobley well fargo security analyst thank bothjason child chief financial officer thank youoperatorand one moment next question next question come lee simpson morgan stanley lee line open lee simpson morgan stanley analyst great thanks fitting want take u back v profile stood automotive automotive enhanced profile includes licensing texas nxp nvidia etc trying understand much licensing would recognized q number much would gone rpo maybe related know heard correctly mentioned multiple customer working cs release thanksrene haas chief executive officer yeah let jason go detail relative contribution automotive v ai technology licensing standpoint cs engagement multiple partner engaged way think automotive industry extremely complex market need degree customization also want level standardization automotive oems would love solution support full software stack would number different contribution relative differentiation also something could standardized level incredible engagement lot different oems across level confident kind demand seen cs business automotive make kind sense think complexity device cost involved yet need supply chain resiliency let jason address question relative licensing revenue tie togetherjason child chief financial

schulzemelander redburn atlantic line opentimm schulzemelander redburn atlantic analyst yeah hi thanks taking question wanted dig back royalty outlook next quarter trying maybe disaggregate little bit volume pricing impact think talked mix increasing percentage point quarter course give u pretty decent tailwind think guided royalty going grow somewhere sort range maybe give u little bit color break volume price mix thank youjason child chief financial officer ok last quarter look partner growth average detail mix growth average around ish percent obviously grew differential much mix either premium chip higher royalty well higher royalty related v would say going next quarter expecting overall peer group get paid royalty probably ish percent range expecting royalty said somewhere range obviously v portion decent handle mix across different aspect market premium hard know ahead time key component would say going forward expect see effectively unit growth assuming mix across get detail assuming going pretty consistent would assume going continue royalty growth mostly v mix impact continue run pretty significantly ahead overall market unit growthtimm schulzemelander redburn atlantic analyst got helpful thank youjason child chief financial officer thank youoperatorone moment next question next question coming harlan sur jp morgan harlan line openharlan sur jpmorgan chase company analyst good afternoon thanks taking question backlog year year strong q acv strong end year obviously combination large renewal importantly customer seems like across end market right adopting higher valueadded compute compute subsystem ip sort look toward future chip design program look renewal pipeline discussion customer program timing look like going drive strong licensing growth year pipeline suggest team grow total backlog fiscal yearjason child chief financial officer harlan jason start start question think high level look last year kind back booking looking revenue plus change backlog total number billion last year look kind assuming year definitely assuming le last year started number quite bit billion mentioned really strong booking year mostly incremental deal came mostly due ai assumption year license right probably maybe booking last year least would take get kind plan certainly opportunity look last year overage probably somewhere similar range started plan probably like actually achieved good line sight current plan provide relatively wide range mostly try factor timing deal going hit whether q q whatever kind back say well see kind midpoint guidance year confidence level would say plus percent midpoint plan guidance already either backlog contract royalty really trying trying forecast incremental booking going sign year bunch
