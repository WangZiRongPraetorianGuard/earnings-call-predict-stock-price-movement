since beginning q repurchased million worth share existing b program overall remain active repurchasing share would like turn back operator question question answer operatorthank operator instruction first question come ross seymore deutsche bank line openross seymore deutsche bank analyst hi guy thanks letting ask question first inventory management general kurt sounded lot like done great job channel side oem side gotten little bit excess category talk guess channel side plan million coming plan still number oem side think normalizes throughout yearkurt sievers president chief executive officer yeah hey thanks ross good morning indeed think color put would concur channel side feel safe much control relative inventory let put way quarter absolutely intention go beyond range hover think past two quarter consider q maybe increase precision hold intention increase general inventory really first quarter rest year ross much different put past couple quarter start replenish see sufficient momentum market justify mean neither guarantee end year hit inventory longterm target fast hectic step possibly start assume come back later call expect market recovery second half year make likely start replenish channel really something function market environment size indeed million discussed necessarily part consideration annual revenue movement inventory excess inventory direct customer indeed think started try correct one back second quarter last year think first time also talked earnings call see automotive tier customer majority sitting excess inventory fact knew already ross thanks ncnr system discussed ncnr order way case different construct peer using annual annual mean tied calendar year explicit currently ncnr order running end calendar year ncnr order hindsight good let customer call u say see problem see building inventory since second quarter last year busy try normalize reasonable cadence also good financials coming back question yes think still busy middle year mainly would say almost exclusively automotive something automotive middle year behind u move shipping end demand direct customer automotive shipping end demand second halfross seymore deutsche bank analyst thanks color guess second question focusing auto side helpful hear six growth driver overall automotive radar plan ev talk expectation growth driver fiscal kurt sievers president chief executive officer well principle would say excess inventory would normal world ross stick longterm growth includes set performance growth driver specified back analyst day november moving around little transparently gave color past year pending speed inventory control think might noticed say radar actually performing target reason really radar relatively concentrated customer base almost direct customer inventory control much easier exercise specified product range nonfragmented customer base easier get handle inventory control say inventory control radar already completely behind u make obviously much better year longer term threeyear horizon ross assume come target specified back november ross seymore deutsche bank analyst thank youoperatorthank next question come vivek arya bank america line openvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks taking question kurt last quarter good enough kind give u little bit color one quarter ahead hoping could share thought see q generically shaping flat sequentially take commentary full year think mentioned sort flattish growth overall still suggests kind doubledigit growth back half realize visibility limited forth market color share give confidence sort doubledigit growth back half would usefulkurt sievers president chief executive officer good morning vivek yeah apparently good man last time relative next quarter think reiterated piece gave happy give bit color around really see different part revenue dependent cycle exposed consumeroriented business iot part industrial iot mobile think left trough way behind u first quarter last year seasonal fluctuation continue grow throughout calendar year large part anyway supplied channel suffering excess inventory digestion pretty positive part company grow time reiterate said last time comms infra business decline yearoveryear perspective revenue comms infra versus calendar year think discussed length bit piece come block automotive core industrial indeed something first half second half inventory digestion direct customer automotive discussed question ross minute ago believe turning point somewhere around middle year inventory still sitting digested put piece together vivek obviously half going bigger half obviously half year going half last year put somewhere flat plusminus range full year indeed confidence really come view inventory digestion automotive core industrial side end time continued gradual improvement consumeroriented business given tight channel management excess inventory really come fromvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst right thank kurt followup industrial trend industrial iot trend big contrast peer get right early spot growing first half last year much much better long maintain contrast peer right seeing kind decline industrial iot business applestoapples comparison think somewhat convergence peer reporting term industrial correction versus strength nxp seeing right nowkurt sievers president chief executive officer look vivek course know judge exactly conceptually contrast alive long need digest overinventory channel simple never build actually back second quarter mind second quarter almost two year ago started control channel keep month level even troughed first quarter even went since kept steady meantime peer kept shipping hard need correct contract disappear moment overshipment done actually behind mean maybe another number vivek put perspective gave transparency intentionally last year nxp company grow revenue also told pricing last year give feel pretty significant volume decline last year supply perspective plus revenue plus price give volume decline clearly shipping think end demand certainly peer mean take number peer many bit hard time shipped harder first least first three quarter last year curve end going thing matter ship need reduce shipment answer think fundamental difference vivek want claim much better industrial business think disciplined handle earliervivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst understood thank kurtoperatorthank next question come stacy rasgon bernstein research line openkurt sievers president chief executive officer stacy thereoperatorstacy line openkurt sievers president chief executive officer operator go next caller circle around stacystacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst hellokurt sievers president chief executive officer hear stacy good morningstacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst yeah know going thanks taking question question iot trend obviously bottomed q last year wondering could parse recovery trend consumer piece core industrial know consumer getting little better increase trough year ago consumer general purpose iot piece started recover well like trend across two pieceskurt sievers president chief executive officer yeah thanks stacy fair question indeed two trending differently would say iot piece way segment indeed gradually improved since trough quarter last calendar year gradual mean getting better better better still level peak way used gradually improving case think revealed good portion china think largely distribution largely chinaoriented iot business yes trend starting bottom q last year gradually improving continue see continue rest calendar year core industrial part indeed taken somewhat different shape think like automotive suffering bit inventory much end market weakness would say core industrial relatively speaking somewhat le good shape still face shifted iot portion think core industrial bit similar see automotivestacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst got thank followup wanted ask lead time normalized precovid level part enabling keep pricing flat like better control pricing better control lead time got lot competitor talking pricing starting come nowkurt sievers president chief executive officer first part question stacy absolute yes lead time normal mean forget supply constraint normal lead time back precovid time help lot also relative visibility double ordering need ncnrs thing consider behind u back normal perspective real correlation pricing stacy pricing quoted flat year end mainly function input cost living world sharply rising input cost past three year look normal view handle input cost year around zero would say also put forward pricing found acceptance buyin customer stacy really correlated lead time understand question commodity portfolio since correlation really existstacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst got helpful thank guysoperatorthank next question come gary mobley well fargo security line opengary mobley well fargo security analyst hey guy thanks taking question kurt called betterthanexpected revenue mobile side appear poised pretty significant yearoveryear growth mobile first half fiscal year function android market le bad largely function maybe traction ultrawideband function content gain largest mobile customerkurt sievers president chief executive officer gary full transparency function weak compare last year pull mean look q last year horrendously low function everything explained last minute clearly mainly function weak compare however mentioned least one thing certainly case clearly see android inventory digestion completely behind u would almost claim already q largely behind u android shipping end demand could also somewhat hopeful android market development going forward certainly case premium handset customer also would say decent shape relative volume development much function u trying get quickly possible true end demand suffering excess inventory mean good example also help side equation quickly come back growthgary mobley well fargo security analyst thank kurt bill seem calling gross margin fiscal year basis point prior year quite commendable considering going industry whatnot seems like lot gross margin headwind utilization mix headwind whatnot maybe give u additional color term offset headwind allowing gross margin resiliencybill betz chief financial officer sure let use q example q talk lever tailwind headwind q slightly better know basis point really driven distribution mix represented sale q q guiding basis point primarily driven lower distribution mix lower slightly lower fallthrough sale seasonally adjusting distribution sale still probably better year ago mix standpoint remember distribution sale q think bit better offsetting underutilization recall q year ago running low running low got moving part yearoveryear compare quarteroverquarter compare really driven mix talking tailwind headwind right clearly go current utilization level low becomes headwind u know managing level see last three quarter running internal factory represent internal source wafer another obviously headwind obviously lower revenue lower fallthrough fixed cost structure see lower pricing far see able keep stable flat yearoveryear comparison standpoint lower pricing job offset lower cost productivity gain obviously longer term delay new product introduction could cause impact quarter quarter based timing tailwind higher revenue think fixed cost structure fall replenish channel back normal level kurt talked million richer mix decide becomes tailwind utilization improve utilization internally going back something mids tailwind another one something talked plan expand distribution reach mass market customer think good job like peer something going focus better reach customer clearly going continue execute productivity gain importantly longer term ramp new product introduction accretive corporate gross margin today think manage tailwind headwind quarter quarter going best maintain near high end model said type revenue levelsgary mobley well fargo security analyst helpful thanks billbill betz chief financial officer thank youoperatorthank next question come francois bouvignies ubs line openfrancois bouvignies ubs analyst thank much two maybe followup previous question first one automotive mean mentioned basically managing channel shipping moment clear picture second half year summarize quantify maybe much undership demand maybe last two quarter look auto revenue year year production car obviously much higher wondering intelligence much shipping automotive right basically would go way soft cycle wondering quantification would helpfulkurt sievers president chief executive officer yeah hi francois exact quantification guess pointer useful view look one individual quarter think since full calendar year behind u look full year think auto business grow also said company increased pricing let u assume minute auto also increase price order magnitude basically put almost zero supply increase line last year automotive say zero growth automotive last year supply unit go would call super bullish automotive year last year think end saar increase million unit rocking increase electric car think xev car last year growing year year mean good argument discussed often lot content increased top saar shipped zero mean give feel strong view already significantly undershipped last year time mean obvious overshipped time believe started early taking handle controlling overshipment throttling back think last year undershipped distribution side automotive revenue would say take started take stringent action second quarter last year also control shipment direct side one completely done yet hard quantify francois know size inventory individual tier customer want keep long run also steady target mean discussed often target term many week semiconductor inventory want keep first ranging widely different tier could quote range two week week really place also change time soon see reason believe business going grow mean oem call offs getting want grow inventory bit moving target think u synthesis believe middle calendar year behind usfrancois bouvignies ubs analyst great answer thank second followup pricing mean said flattish pricing obviously seems like better peer understand commodity part also input cost look input cost electricity coming mean obviously peak silicon wafer coming mature node foundry level coming pressure many many tier tier foundry wondering input cost main tracker pricing think year see input cost also coming pressure see meankurt sievers president chief executive officer look couple thing francois first glad get well get head around yet little early honest time think put good piece together relative input cost one put fact tier foundry still bit tight lipped cost decrease biggest part input tier foundry tier tier foundry need tier foundry automotive core industrial business unfortunately trend quite ambitious mentioned time francois believe say mid longer term industry return low singledigit asp erosion year year precovid period applicationspecific business like think reasonable assume also going happen mid longerterm future however year transition year input yet input cost inflationary environment yet level used past important know probably clear want reiterate clearly mean falling back level precovid saying level achieved possibly mid longerterm future low singledigit asp erosion per year absolutely see scenario fall back level precovidfrancois bouvignies ubs analyst great thank muchoperatorthank next question come chris danely citi line openchris danely citi analyst hey thanks guy term thing getting little bit tougher last three month kurt way tell much guess worsening demand versus little inventory thought way either side thatkurt sievers president chief executive officer hey good morning chris yeah clearly first confirm say got worse last day least view exposed got worse would say end demand auto weakened mean latest sp data almost percentage point year year term saar little le xev penetration little slowing still little slowing gradual movement lesspositive side day ago think probably somewhat bigger part got better handle remaining size excess inventory tier automotive customer working first half pas percentage one two contributing much would say say combination automotive core industrial inventory time weakening macrochris danely citi analyst great followup think bill talked disti sale q last year sale q hear right wrongbill betz chief financial officer correct chrischris danely citi analyst yes ok question sale grew guess q q would mean sale disti grew lot would happen environment like overall least outside guy little difficultbill betz chief financial officer basically matching sellthroughkurt sievers president chief executive officer chris think background mainly exposure distribution larger industrial iot business one seen trough already first quarter last year gradual improvement throughout quarter discussed earlier show distribution side segment improvement automotive distribution described direct customer excess inventory digestion distribution smaller part think reflection exposure different end market segmentschris danely citi analyst got thanks color
