capital cup runneth increased dividend ask would like pay something like normalized earnings course hard calculate always normalized earnings mind little bit ahead sometimes little bit behind sometimes could give people kind consistent dividend guidance etc think far important question look going oversimplify basically prepare u total basel endgame today roughly specific matter much remember lot thing change short run long run look like basel iii endgame may worst case something le obviously happens would free lot capital going say order billion something like yes always capital hierarchy way going use capital build business first pay dividend steady dividend build business think appropriate buy back stock continuing buy back stock billion year personally want buy back lot current price think heard talk world thing like waiting preparation basel hopefully know something later much specific meantime also important put mind shortterm us capital good shareholder could reduce cet may see u thing short run increase earnings increase capital using capital jeremy mentioned one thing know balance sheet use balance sheet credit trading could thing great position going patient urge analyst keep mind excess capital wasted capital earnings store deploy good way shareholder due coursejeremy barnum chief financial officer betsy wanted add welcome back thought well minor edit jamies answer think misspoke said billion year buyback trajectory billion quarterjamie dimon chairman chief executive officer sorry billion quarterjeremy barnum chief financial officer otherwise

excellent u toooperatorthank next question come jim mitchell seaport global may proceedjim mitchell seaport global security analyst hey good morning jeremy speak trend seeing respect deposit migration quarter change seen migration start slow notjeremy barnum chief financial officer yeah good question jim think simplest best answer really saying migration checking saving cd sort dominant trend driving increase weighted average rate paid consumer deposit franchise continues continue capture money motion high rate happy mean consumer franchise level engagement seeing aware little bit narrative seeing end people sometimes refer cashsorting looked data see evidence maybe slowing little bit quite cautious really sort think make sense assume world checking saving paying effectively zero policy rate going see ongoing migration frankly expect see even world even current yield curve environment change meaningful cut get reintroduced would actually start see would still expect see ongoing migration yieldseeking behavior quite conceivable actually yield curve fourth quarter six cut still nonetheless expecting increase weighted average rate paid migration continues would say meaningful change trend expectation ongoing migration much still therejim mitchell seaport global security analyst ok followup sort bigger picture nii sort biggest driver outlook migration forward curve balance sound like migration curious hear thought biggest driver upside downsidejeremy barnum chief financial officer yes mean think driver let u say embedded current guidance actually meaningfully different fourth quarter meaning current yield curve little bit stale snap quarter end roughly three cut current yield curve said expectation ongoing internal migration meaningful offset card revolve growth little bit le prior year still tailwind expect deposit balance sort flat modestly little bit headwind margin obviously wildcard potential productlevel reprice always say going make decision situationally function competitive condition marketplace know obviously world got something like billion deposit paying effectively zero relatively small change productlevel reprice change nii run rate lot error band pretty wide always going stick mantra losing primary bank relationship thinking longterm health franchise think deposit pricingjim mitchell seaport global security analyst right ok great thanks color thanksoperatorthank next question come john mcdonald autonomous research may proceedjohn mcdonald autonomous research analyst thanks jeremy mentioned conference earlier year street might need build reserve growth card growth reserve build see quarter kind seasonal would still expect kind growth math play term card growth reserve build needsjeremy barnum chief financial officer yes john short yes question yes relative lack build quarter function normal seasonal pattern card yes still expect card loan growth full year yes still mean else equal think consensus allowance build back three quarter still little low map expected card loan growth obviously wildcard happens probability parameter output internal process assessing sku cecl distribution speaking one way guy opinion fine narrowly saying based card loan growth expect normal coverage ratio expect build back half yearjohn mcdonald autonomous research analyst ok got followup make super clear idea market nii outlook revised billion revenueneutral guess obvious thing typically offset fee income guide idea would way structuring trade way balance sheet evolving offset would expect market fee lower market nii correctjeremy barnum chief financial officer exactly right specifically going shift onbalance sheet offbalance sheet financing business prime within market actually see little bit pop market balance sheet supplement thing related fundamentally think like either hold equity balance sheet noninterest bearing high funding expense negative nii receive total return form derivative exactly economics impact nii shift function sort borrower relationship marketplace way bottom line effectively neutral second order effect change geography quite bit happened quarter emphasizing time nii ex market better number focus term indicator core banking franchise performingjohn mcdonald autonomous research analyst thank youoperatorthank next question come ebrahim poonawala bank america may proceedebrahim poonawala bank america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guess term jamie think outlook economy would appreciate thought health customer base commercial consumer think higher longer maybe economy strong get rate cut seeing talk customer feedback getting banker momentum picking appreciate macro risk jamies pointed getting trying get sense view term likely outcome based seeing today customersjamie dimon chairman chief executive officer would say consumer customer fine unemployment low home price dropped stock price dropped amount income need service debt still kind low extra money lowerincome folk running running normalizing see credit normalizing little bit course higherincome folk still money still spending whatever happens customer pretty good shape go recession would pretty good shape business good shape look today confidence order book drop profit caution people result lot fiscal spending lot qe etc really know going happen also want look year look two year three year geopolitical effect oil gas much fiscal spending actually take place election etc good ok right mean ok road look inflection point ok current time always true true true time cautious side people feel confidence level necessarily stop inflection point everything ok today got prepared range outcome thing want point question interest rate yield curve nii credit loss one thing projected today based think economic scenario generally accepted economic scenario generally accepted rate cut fed number always wrong ask question thing happen like higher rate modest recession etc number change think u surprised happens think chance happen higher people know outcome want guess outcome never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point economy literally life historyebrahim poonawala bank america merrill lynch analyst helpful tied look commercial real estate jp economy overall higher rate alone enough create vulnerability issue beyond office cre would characterize health cre marketjamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yes put two bucket first fine got good reserve office think multifamily fine jeremy give detail want think real estate two piece rate go think yield curve whole yield curve fed fund year bond rate go asset asset every asset planet including real estate worth le well obviously creates little bit stress strain people roll finance true real estate true everybody happens leveraged loan real estate effect second thing happen happens strong economy well bad real estate people hiring filling thing financial asset happens stagflation well worst case sudden going vacancy going company cutting back going le lease affect including multifamily filter whole economy way people really experienced since would put back mind important interest rate important recession important thing stay today kind soft landing seems embedded marketplace everyone real estate muddle obviously would idiosyncratic different city different type b versus building people muddle muddle higher rate recession would tougher lot folk real estate fact happensebrahim poonawala bank america merrill lynch analyst helpful thank muchoperatorthank next question come erika najarian ubs may proceederika najarian ubs analyst hi good morning given response betsys question cet today prepares basel iii endgame written earn without fdic assessment ahead investor day guess six week five week think throughthecycle target right capital level per guy overearning todayjeremy barnum chief financial officer right interesting framing question erika think pretty consistent overearning right obviously one major area overearning deposit margin especially consumer sort expecting sequential decline nii talked compressing deposit margin increase weighted average rate paid think probably single biggest source let u call excess earnings currently also heard jamie say overearning credit mean wholesale chargeoffs particularly low built current run rate bit le clear extent earning card course chargeoffs close normalized essentially go extended period chargeoffs low historical standard although coupled nii also low historical standard bottomline perspective entirely clear net broadly really deposit margin biggest single factor overearning narrative embedded question think little bit thinking cet light current level capital talk investor day hoping would interesting thing say investor day light potential update basel iii endgame given single important factor much denominator expansion see basel iii endgame rate going actually know much investor day might much say except reiterate said past whatever going good return absolute term good relative term optimize seek reprice adjust various way best ability given structure rule proposed least lot optimized away base case think headwinderika najarian ubs analyst got followup question mentioned current curve set nii outlook upon stale guess matter seems like market downpricing obviously june cut september cut tossup december matter year think billion price rate cut totally matter much given seems like june one thatjeremy barnum chief financial officer yes sorry erika quick thing one let u focus nii ex total nii would anchor billion number two want math like change average fund rate rest year multiply time ear like guest look like good approach would remind billion deposit paying practically small change make big difference got factor got impact qt deposit balance etc etc etc want make sure get precise giving best guess based series assumption going going bejamie dimon chairman chief executive officer know going wrongerika najarian ubs analyst thanksoperatorthank next question come ken usdin jefferies may proceedken usdin jefferies analyst thanks good morning jeremy wondering could expand little bit one prepared comment talked hope expectation investment banking pipeline continue move along obviously saw good movement ecm dcm lag advisory talk mentioned like potential cautiousness around election hearing corporate side sponsor side relates like go nogo type feel conversation level thinking need kick start another good level ipo activity ecm marketsjeremy barnum chief financial officer sure yes let take ipo first little bit cautious cohort vintage ipo performed somewhat disappointingly think narrative changed meaningful degree quarter think seeing better ipo performance obviously equity market little bit pressure last day general lot support always help dialogue quite good lot interesting different type conversation happening global firm multinationals carveout type thing dialogue good valuation environment better like sort decent reason optimism course ecm always pipeline dynamic condition particularly good quarter caution little bit pullforward even acute think dcm side given quite high percentage total amount debt needed refinanced year gotten done first quarter factor question think probably single important question impact also knockon impact dcm acquisition financing wellknown kind regulatory headwind definitely bit chilling effect know heard narrative maybe like pentup deal demand know important politics know fundamentally said think press call happy see momentum quarter happy see momentum announced little bit cautious pullforward dynamic little bit cautious regulatory headwind end going fight really hard share wallet hereken usdin jefferies analyst got guess stick theme capital market surprising see little bit tougher comp ficc think guy kind indicated maybe flattish fee pool reasonable place know impossible guide maybe talk dynamic term activity across fixed income equity business feel like type environment given lingering uncertainty rate client either engaged le engaged term positioning portfoliosjeremy barnum chief financial officer yes really good question would say general sort volatility uncertainty rate environment overall balance actually supportive market revenue pool think together generally balance sheet deployment well sort level natural background growth one reason overall level market revenue stabilized meaningfully normal prepandemic period occasionally make u little bit anxious like oh sustainable might downside seem new normal think rate lower zero bound sort normal dynamic global rate affect rate business affect foreign exchange business generally make asset allocation decision important interesting creates risk management need active manager need grapple forth think theme market side margin yes see rest year go sort seems behaving relatively normally would sayoperatorthank next question come mike mayo well fargomike mayo well fargo security analyst hi jamie trying reconcile concern ceo letter sure page see put lot effort appreciated talked scenario tail risk macro risk geopolitical risk several year week month get hand firm investing much outside yous whether commercial digital banking consumer wholesale payment trying reconcile kind action word specifically global wholesale payment going mentioned country business lot business particular doingjeremy barnum chief financial officer right mike sorry tell jamie actually left u leadership offsite remote think left call hand better worse let try address point without sort speaking jamie think talk impact geopolitical uncertainty outlook part point note yous isolated right global macroeconomic problem result geopolitical situation problem outside yous affect global economy therefore yous therefore corporate customer etc etc context keeping mind always say invest cycle sort go go country leave country etc obviously adjust around edge manage risk make choice function overall geopolitical environment broadly notion would pull back meaningfully one key competitive strength company always sort global character particular moment geopolitically would inconsistent always operated term wholesale payment business going great taking share lot innovation lot investment technology lot connectivity payment system different country around world yes sure give color setting good story nice thing seemike mayo well fargo security analyst followup great term wholesale payment given dislocation world war supply chain change everything else wholesale payment greatjeremy barnum chief financial officer well think one thing payment business sense mean recessionproof probably wrong word case dealing recession talking fundamentally moving money pipe around world thing people need le matter one piece think piece willingness invest always focus one key thing separating u business right seeing benefit thatmike mayo well fargo security analyst right thank youjeremy barnum chief financial officer thanks mikeoperatorthank next question come glenn schorr evercore may proceedglenn schorr evercore isi analyst thank commentary ken question great clear investment banking near term year biggerpicture question term good spelling overearning feel like underearning investment banking side use number past like look market added like trillion equity market cap trillion fixed income market cap last year yes wallet like plus year average bigger upside matter ifjeremy barnum chief financial officer yes glenn short yes mean think shy saying underearning investment banking clearly cycle average point talking get back prepandemic wallet know point like march right beginning pandemic like four year ago point gdp growth especially nominal term period would expect wallet grow think meaningful upside investment banking fee wallet noted headwind think particularly time would hope amount function underlying industrial logic rather regulatory environment could see mean reversion yes sort leaning engaging client making sure appropriately resourced robust level wallet fighting every dollar shareglenn schorr evercore isi analyst maybe one followup always investing clearly get paid growth across franchise relative lot bank keeping expense lot closer flat envision environment maybe rephrase type environment would jpmorgan pull back tremendous investment spending wave going throughjeremy barnum chief financial officer sure think first thing say somewhat obvious going say anyway like autogovernors right like portion expense base directly related revenue whether volumerelated commission whether incentive compensation whether thing autocorrecting element expense base would happen automatically part normal discipline point one point two independently environment always looking efficiency little bit hard see world guiding guess special assessment added billion expense hard tell story efficiency generated underneath part dna company happen bau time grind thing get benefit scale try extract efficiency think get heart question ok type environment would make different strategic question end think little bit environment really like talk like normal recession visibility cycle would change longterm strategic investment plan always built financial modeling perspective assuming resilience cycle would could environment whatever reason change business case certain investment even certain business lead u make meaningfully different strategic choice yes would throughthecycle analysis changed reason see u fundamentally making strategically different decision strategic outlook unchanged simply business cycle short termglenn schorr evercore isi analyst awesome thank youjeremy barnum chief financial officer thanksoperatorthank next question come matt oconnor deutsche bank may proceedmatt oconnor deutsche bank analyst good morning mentioned one use capital lean trading business balance sheet see trading asset going q probably seasonal also lot year year necessarily translate higher revenue know like match necessarily quarter maybe elaborate like leaning trading balance sheet expect benefit timejeremy barnum chief financial officer yes sure let break question couple different part think jamie sort suggesting think concept kind like strategic capital versus tactical capital lack better term kind saying moment carrying lot excess capital sort strategic reason ability least theory deploy portion kind like relatively shortduration asset strategy client opportunity whatever moment whatever reason might thought tactical sense pointing option extent quarter increase market rwa reflection maybe little bit probably agree hard given quarter specifically link change capital rwa change revenue many moving part sure one thing true higher run rate market business whole talked second ago linked also higher deployment balance sheet business well know pride extremely analytical extremely disciplined analyze capital liquidity balance sheet deployment gsib capacity utilization etc market business chase revenue go return fully measured part dna continue still operating multiple binding constraint obviously environment complex ability sort throw ton capital opportunity quite simple always big picture clearly strong capital position small part anticipation uncertainty also mean opportunity arise basel iii endgame final wellpositioned take advantage opportunitiesmatt oconnor deutsche bank analyst got separately within consumer card business highlighted volume year year obviously still strong piece trend within worth noting term change spend category either overall among certain segmentsjeremy barnum chief financial officer maybe little bit jamie already alluded somewhat think spend fine boomy broadly speaking would say look lot different way inflation cohort etc kind triangulate get back kind flattish picture little bit evidence substituting discretionary nondiscretionary think single notable thing effect true real income gone lowestincome cohort within obviously probability distribution rather distribution outcome people whose real income therefore struggling little bit unfortunately observe spending pattern people meaningful slowing rather might feared sort aggressive levering think maybe economic indicator sort although portion population small enough sure readacross big encouraging credit perspective mean people behaving kind rationally sort normal postpandemic type way manage balance sheet sort margin good news credit perspectivematt oconnor deutsche bank analyst ok helpful thank muchoperatorthank next question come gerard cassidy rbc capital market may proceedgerard cassidy rbc capital market analyst hi jeremyjeremy barnum chief financial officer hey gerard doinggerard cassidy rbc capital market analyst good thanks notwithstanding guy outlook uncertainty course jamie talked shareholder letter addressed also call earlier guy share share u color going corporate lending market term spread seem getting tighter reflecting think real fear global geopolitical world color guy seeing leveraged loan market welljeremy barnum chief financial officer right think true spread general broadly credit spread including secondary market extent leverage lending space exceptionally tight sure reversed little bit last day broadly throughout quarter really seen credit spread tighten quite bit even see little bit oci quarter loss oci would higher rate meaningfully offset tighter credit spread portfolio broadly sort keeping big runup saw equity market general sort bullish tone saw quite bit credit spread tightening secondary market think manifested little bit leveraged lending space normal way lot competition among provider revenue pool start see little bit loosening term always make u little bit concerned past going well prepared lose share space like term never compromise structure seeing little bit think away leveraged lending space broader ci space moment month ago think small part result bank generally anticipating challenging capital environment sort disciplining little bit lending seeing little bit widening actually corporate lending spread know trend like survived last week always little bit hard observe case would say broadly dynamic tension people trying careful balance sheet fact overall asset price condition quite supportive secondary market credit spread rallied lotgerard cassidy rbc capital market analyst guess tiein question answer read seen much private credit growth country private credit company give u color seeing competitor also client jpmorgan balance two may see bidding business would like time supporting businessjeremy barnum chief financial officer right yes mean think tension u provider secured financing portion private credit private equity community talking different part capital structure recognize compete area client area part franchise good level narrowly private credit interesting observe going would say u strategy much productagnostic actually much like oh private credit syndicated lending take good stuff take stuff always good individual silo need underwriting skill structuring skill origination distribution secondary trading risk appetite credit analysis capability really good increasingly see actually see u little bit private credit space get bigger start make sense actually bring colenders sort big enough deal without undue concentration risk mean even capital may want concentration risk funny way private credit space becomes little bit like syndicated lending space time syndicated lending space influenced little bit private credit unitranche structure get pushed little bit private credit direction term like speed execution aspect business work watching competitive dynamic interesting certainly pressure area really think overall value proposition competitive position second none looking forward future heregerard cassidy rbc capital market analyst appreciate color thank youoperatorthank last question come charles peabody portales line opencharles peabody portales partner analyst good morning couple question first republic acquisition u obviously thought would home run glad see jamie dimon validated annual letter look first quarter annualizes billion billion billion jamie published letter know want extrapolate remind u sort cost saving still quarter see expense come million million secondly offset accretion becomes le le want extrapolate billion billion first questionjeremy barnum chief financial officer ok thanks charlie going best answer question sticking sort gun giving much first republicspecific guidance think kind framework articulating broadly correct let go piece yes current quarter result annualize billion jamie talked yes big part reason discount accretion frontloaded result shortdated asset part reason see converge yes also true expect expense run rate decline later year continue making progress integration obviously think mentioned last quarter fullyear perspective offset full year calendarization effect maybe embedded question talked billion integration expense integration real expense real also time spent quite real lot work lot people going well done yet take lot effort broadly think expectation integration expense probably coming bit lower originally assumed morning deal couple reason one framework around time understandably quite conservative sort assumed would kind lose meaningful portion franchise would sort need size expense base accordingly course worked point quite bit better therefore amount expense necessary keep bigger franchise higher mean le integration expense associated taking number probably also true integration assumption conservative based kind typical type bank assumption opposed particular nature deal including fdic forth yes think probably pretty complete answer question thanks charliecharles peabody portales partner analyst quick followup next home run going come strategic beyond jpmorgan probably going regional bank failure whether year next year opportunity pick seeing private equity family office setting participate next round bank failure mnuchins buying nycb clearly create platform rollups failed bank family office filed shelf registration bank holding company whose specific purpose buy failed bank think opportunity going competed away private credit part think regulator going view private credit different party le attractive party versus bank takeover failed bank questionjeremy barnum chief financial officer right ok charlie lot honest love idea spending lot time call speculating bank failure like obviously particular view next wave landscape going bother debating guess let try say couple thing best answer question like talked earlier lot capital jamie say capital earnings store right see lot really compelling opportunity deploy capital opportunity arise despite uncertainty basel iii endgame wellpositioned deploy think embedded also sort question fdic fdic attitude toward different type bidder obviously lot thinking analysis happening entire process recent forum speech bank resolution forth think probably agree better else equal system much capital available many different type capital available ensure thing stabilized anything ever go wrong mechanic talking bank trivial underestimated guess probably much thatcharles peabody portales partner analyst thank youoperatorwe
