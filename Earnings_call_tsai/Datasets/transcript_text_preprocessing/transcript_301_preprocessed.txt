please go aheadross seymore deutsche bank analyst hi guy thanks asking question clearly kind tale two city data center ai side going really strong rest much get bad news way first magnitude drop ex data center kind shocking walk u much something going come back know stuff g etc versus view taking cyclical medicine snapback ensue soon thereaftermatt murphy president chief executive officer yeah hey great thanks ross yeah definitely tale two city carrier enterprise consumer side way think sure drop pretty steep q q definitely going cyclical downturn industry long time seen happen going way think business peak together billion revenue would sort pandemic supply chain issue went see shipping well said prepared remark solid business ross marvell recover greater billion revenue time question remember well within business long product life cycle typically like seven year production design case three four five year ago year two ago feel good business going demand softness inventory correction expect see behind u specific none due business coming back share loss fact thing recover back normalized run rate marvell product growth driver segment carrier enterprise drive growth going forward managing short termross seymore deutsche bank analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come matt ramsey td cowen please go aheadmatt ramsay td cowen analyst thank much good afternoon guy guess kind twopart question custom silicon business first part matt gave u good color script see million exiting year exceeding million next kind referenced billion dollar scale wonder could maybe square rest circle business today fiscal come guess second part question observation guy probably shot goal custom silicon b one shot goal could potentially large larger expected piece business given happening ai trend guess concern evaluate opportunity program shipping two three four year advance trying figure program would sort align dominant player space road map two three year pace innovation like guy evaluate potential size business lot shot goal probability shot ongoing successful might hard gauge given quickly industry moving hopefully make sense trying get idea scaling business taking order given volatility rapid technology advancement space matt murphy president chief executive officer ok yeah gotcha matt let tackle first one yes super excited ramp seeing custom silicon program couple year back shipping q program fantastic gave color prepared remark exit rate million plus want cap point certainly sort way think floor go would imply obviously fiscal much larger number million called think still dynamic still early excited bullish forecast seeing customer look strong program way ahead plan articulated way back second question yes think ever seen design win activity career right ai custom silicon networking optic name whole transformation going data center architecture creating massive opportunity marvell specifically custom portion mean talking tam creation going ten billion dollar range talk ai day significant sort opportunity emerging front u said view complementary merchant leader space think place given workload required given scale computing needed think zerosum game saying think segment merchant side well custom side going grow enormous tam yes right mix major opportunity program assembled incredible team incredible portfolio technology announced today continued partnership tsmc full robust road map ip technology specifically address ai accelerated computing application next generation got lot excitement customer well yes overall bullish think whole boat going lift one certainly marvell creates huge new tam opportunity really year agomatt ramsay td cowen analyst thanks mattmatt murphy president chief executive officer thank yeah operatorthe next question come christopher rolland susquehanna please go aheadchris rolland susquehanna international group analyst hey thanks guy guess first matt thanks giving custom asic opportunity number think mean probably mean guy pretty strong pipeline would love drill little bit guess first maybe talk opportunity training versus inference see versus perhaps compute kind secret sauce landing like competitor really used time leadingedge serdes ip driver win something special sauce winning thingsmatt murphy president chief executive officer yeah thanks chris great hear yeah hopefully custom number helpful investor last year year lot interest sort size got visibility great start articulating think think second sort piece question around training versus inference compute point would put large bucket calling decabillions tam creation know call certainly prepared slice even think know going three five year relative exact split would say opportunity set u cross application ok relative term technology competitiveness mean pretty astonishing think design chris fivenanometer really first time marvell compete segment especially data center origin business go back purchase avera pivoted road map dependency close right nanometer technology way fivenanometer even though first time serdes competitive packaging technology interconnect manufacturing scale strategic partnership supply chain enabled u win significant share asics business coming fruition fiscal followed threenanometer platform big part opportunity set funnel competing today completely different position relative fivenanometer learning readiness really leaning ok term first mindset around nanometer dietodie interconnect packaging serdes technology optic really chiplets think stitch together top scale marvell strategic partnership really look customer like incredibly solid trustworthy longterm partner need really help realize ai silicon ambition today mean great fivenanometer going great threenanometer going great future thankschris rolland susquehanna international group analyst congrats thanks mattmatt murphy president chief executive officer yeahoperatorthe next question come quinn bolton needham company please go aheadquinn bolton needham company analyst hey guy going follow cloud asic question well guess coming margin perspective matt look program cloud compute side extent integrate highbandwidth memory certainly nice thing asp also pretty significant cost may pas wondering talk gross margin asic platform compare corporate average ramp especially cloud asics get similar size optic know good margin see margin mix changing strong ramp cloud asic program got quick followup sneak inmatt murphy president chief executive officer sure yeah mean way talked business actually since avera would always due nature custom business lower gross margin overall company average target time nre nonrecurring engineering receive part customer funding program operating margin business tend competitive time line company target start talking large program got opportunity given volume scale om line really drive lot leverage model gm due nature business model always little bit lower total would say though time sort followon sometimes see happens happens overall company gross margin profile remember still strong gross margin merchant business storage networking automotive even undershipping demand right year play business come back little bit margin offset custom stuff still managing longterm target model yes cloud stuff especially volume certainly lower gross margin got quick one second otherwise got inaudiblequinn bolton needham company analyst yeah quick one second one mentioned sort ramping aec multiple hyperscalers year wondering might able give u sense meaningful sense magnitude rampmatt murphy president chief executive officer yeah think would say absolutely real market felt way time even back acquired inphi sort shot goal thought possible think big news qualifying multiple hyperscalers starting go production year get nice solid kind fullyearish ramp fiscal definitely incremental additive category marvell really leverage highspeed highperformance dsp pam technology really inflecting wave ac based older modulation technique participate yes really excited let u let play quarter thanksquinn bolton needham company analyst thanks mattoperatoryour next question come harsh kumar piper sandler please go aheadharsh kumar piper sandler analyst yeah hey guy thanks letting ask question matt ai hot way put kind pole position optical piece still fivepiece give u sense magnitude size business either quarterly last year anything provide u help u size also kind kind growth rate expect see business matt say bottom piece like consumer networking bottom q time frame piece think come bottom q expect piece come bottom qmatt murphy president chief executive officer ok let take first one let willem take second one take breather also answer question yeah first one think gave pretty good color mean think q exit rate ai right well north million bulk said optic start extrapolating know well jeez got add much revenue marvell getting standard cloud side optic another nice chunk got stuff show carrier side talking inphi coherent dsps asics overall inphi business asking since bought clearly outperformed deal model become incredibly strategic asset u term technology picked team synergy portfolio product line super positive look like whole opportunity going much larger think thought year back willem want take second part itwillem

aheadvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks taking question one electrooptics think near term seems q probably little bit breather several strong quarter important question assume electrooptics related ai grow somewhat proportional growth accelerator example look accelerator growth year seen various number kind yearonyear growth ai part electrooptics grow kind commensurate something different sorry start play role electrooptics businessmatt murphy president chief executive officer yeah thanks well think depends definition breather use mean basically ramped significantly right electrooptics business q q q q staying strong q maybe breather sequential growth point view still seen slow let u see got second one third one come back second one second going ramp later year gone really well quals product bringup announced course last year lot demand interest sorry second question aivivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst yeah electrooptics grow kind proportionally sorry growth accelerator yeah matt murphy president chief executive officer yeah sorry yes accelerator sure way think business year year grow line accelerator unit growth think view correlated
