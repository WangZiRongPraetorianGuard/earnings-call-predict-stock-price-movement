Please go ahead, sir. Jinfeng Huang -- Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Irene, and thank you, everyone, for participating in Yatsen's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call today. I would like to begin with a macro overview before diving into the details of our strategy and progress across our segments and brand. China's beauty market experienced a modest recovery in 2023. According to the trusted data published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, total retail sales of consumer goods grew by 8.3% year over year for the fourth quarter and 7.2% for the full year. Against this backdrop, total beauty retail sales were up 1% year over year for the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the full year. Online beauty sales patterns were mixed in 2023. Sales on Tmall decreased, while sales on Douyin increased year over year for both the fourth quarter and full year. We made solid progress this quarter amid a still soft retail environment, returning to a growth trajectory as we executed our strategy transformation plan. Perfect Diary's brand repositioning is also proceeding as intended. To pave the way for future growth, we remained focused on building strong brand equity through superior products and consumer satisfaction while continued investments in brand building and R&D. Our total net revenue for the fourth -- for the quarter beat our guidance, up 6.7% year over year. Net revenues from our skincare brands for the fourth quarter grew by 17.6% year over year. Our clinical and premium skincare brands, including Galenic, DR.WU, and Eve Lom, delivered another solid performance, recording a 23.4% year-over-year growth in combined net revenues and further elevating their contribution to total net revenues. Net revenues from color cosmetics brands declined slightly by 1.8% year over year for the fourth quarter. In terms of channel optimization, we continued to strategically close underperforming offline stores. As of the end of 2023, we operated 110 offline experience stores for the Perfect Diary brand, as compared with 158 stores a year ago. Our two other color cosmetics brands, Little Ondine and Pink Bear, continued to resonate with their customers and recorded year-over-year revenue growth. Our fourth quarter gross margin improved to 73.7% from 71.1% for the prior-year period, benefiting from higher gross margin products and more disciplined pricing and discount policies. Our net loss margin expanded to 46.1% for the fourth quarter, primarily attributable to an impairment of goodwill, as well as increased investments in our brands. The goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter represents the amount by which the carrying value of the Eve Lom reporting unit exceeded its fair value based on quantitative goodwill impairment test due to weaker operating results than expected at the time of acquisition. Despite challenges in the market environment and ongoing competition, we still see potential in the brand. For the full year 2023, our net loss margin was 22%, as compared with 22.2% in 2022. Our non-GAAP net loss margin narrowed to 8.7% from 12.2% for the prior-year period, a significant improvement that underscores our skills in balancing cost structure optimization with the need to grab market opportunities as we drive sustainable growth. Moving on to the brands and products. For our skincare brands, we maintained our focus on brand building and introduced efficient products to foster deeper connections with each brand's audience. Galenic recorded solid performance during the 11.11 Shopping Festival, ranking No. 1 in the premium brightening serum category in terms of retail sales value on both Tmall and Douyin with [Inaudible] VC serum. The brand is also making progress on its Couture line, winning the Essence of the Year award at the Bazaar Beauty Awards 2023 for its Couture Secret d'Excellence active serum. DR.WU's acne research firm announced its first batch of pioneering research projects at the 2023 National Congress of Cosmetics Dermatology in Shanghai, and DR.WU continued to push boundaries in clinical acne research and the application of mandelic acid, propelling the fields of long-term development. Also, Eve Lom opened its first offline store in southern China in January this year, bringing the brand's [Inaudible] experience to a broader customer base. While with that -- with respect to color cosmetics, Perfect Diary's brand repositioning continues to gain traction among its target customers. Biolip Essence Lipstick, the new hero product we launched in September 2023, has been gaining market share in the lipstick category on both Tmall and Douyin. During the quarter, the newly launched lipstick made Perfect Diary the No. 1 lipstick brand in terms of retail sales value on Douyin. Given this product line's potential, we expanded the series to include Biolip Essence Lip Stain in 2023 and the Biolip Essence Matte Lipstick in February 2024, enriching offerings for customers to experience its advanced formulation. Perfect Diary also recently launched its Multi-Peptide Essence Tone Up Cream, the brand's very first product integrating a wrinkle-reducing cream with a makeup primer and a natural foundation. Both Little Ondine and Pink Bear introduced new products during the quarter. Little Ondine's Little White eyeliner pens won the Eye Color Award in the color cosmetics category at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2023, while Pink Bear's Fairy Dream Eyeshadow brought home the C-Beauty Awards' Color Development Award. Moving now to the R&D. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues were 3.4% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year 2023. Over the past year, we have significantly enhanced our R&D capabilities under the leadership of our chief scientist -- scientific officer. Establishing a comprehensive R&D framework and a clear strategic direction, the R&D team has developed iconic products, including Perfect Diary's lipstick essence -- Biolip Essence Lipstick and Galenic's Vivifiant Invigorating Micro Mask. We also strengthened our R&D infrastructure by setting up our Shanghai R&D center. Along with these efforts, we promoted innovation through industry-academia collaborations, including leading initiatives such as the DR.WU's acne research firm and the Galenic dermatology research firm. Going forward, we remain committed to R&D investments to drive innovation and growth. So, before I conclude, a brief update on our 2023 ESG performance. Yatsen's dedication to environmental and social responsibility and employee welfare is integral to our brand and future development. We published our second ESG report in 2023, highlighting our alignment with prevailing green development initiatives. Furthermore, we were honored to be recognized at the China 2023 DEI Employer Awards for our deep commitment to inclusion and employee welfare. To summarize, we are pleased with our return to growth in the fourth quarter and will remain focused on pursuing sustainable growth, with innovation across our brands. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Donghao Yang, to discuss our financial performance.

Questions & Answers: OperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Maggie Huang with CICC. Please go ahead.Unknown speaker Well, thanks for taking my question. This is Maggie Huang from CICC. Firstly, congratulations on our revenue returning to growth and beating our guidance. And I have two questions. The first one is regarding Perfect Diary. We are glad to see the great performance of our new products like Essence Lipstick in Q4. So, for this year, do you have a target revenue contribution from the new product and how should we expect on the revenue growth and net margin of the brand Perfect Diary? That's my first question. And my second question is regarding Women's Day shopping festival. So, how is the performance of our brands so far, and is that in line with our expectation? That's my question. Thank you.Irene Lyu -- Vice President, Head of Strategic Investments and Capital Markets Thank you, Maggie. For your first question on the performance on Perfect Diary, since our launch of the Biolip Essence Lipstick, its performance has been trending up. So, for example, last year, December, the new lipstick is ranking No. 2 on both Tmall and Douyin. So, it's performing well. And in terms of new product's contribution to the brand, last quarter, the fourth quarter of 2023, it's a little below 40%. And we believe, this year, it will turn out to above 50%. So, that's for the new product. And you also asked about margin. So, basically, for this new product launch and also the Perfect Diary's brand upgrade, we are seeing some good feedbacks and results so far. First of all, the gross margin is much higher for this new product compared to the old product. And also, the brand's average selling price also increased a lot to around 140 to 150 on both Tmall and Douyin. And also, in terms of consumer profile, we're also -- attract more customers from higher -- with higher affordability and beauty spending, in general. So, that's for your question number one. And then for question number two, regarding to the Women's Day performance, so far, the Women's Day shopping festival already started. And looking at the overall market, the performance is relatively modest. So, as a result, for our brands, we're also seeing relatively steady growth. So, we are -- more putting more resources and efforts for the bigger shopping festival, for example, 618 and 11.11.Unknown speaker Got it. Definitely helpful. Thank you very much, and I have no more questions.Irene Lyu -- Vice President, Head of Strategic Investments and Capital Markets Thank you.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session.
