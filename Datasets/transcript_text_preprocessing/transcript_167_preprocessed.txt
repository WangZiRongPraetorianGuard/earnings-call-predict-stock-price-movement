gordon jpm jamesjames gordon jpmorgan chase company analyst hello james gordon jp morgan first question guidance strong revenue growth order grow revenue teen year look like need grow rest year term headwind mindful would drive percentage point deceleration heard comment maybe farxiga bbp imfinzi price japan anything else particular farxiga symbicort tagrisso strong quarter thing need watch look quite sustainable also guidance opex ratio little bit good say strong top line two deal revenue little slower yearand consolidate deal need careful ratio still keep pretty high margin could squeeze quick second question ecogen oral g believe expanded trial maybe taking dosing higher latest thinking term might see data see reference ada thinking competitive product might look term weight loss aspect versus recent readout competitorspascal soriot chief executive officer thank james sorry aradhana maybe take first one sharon would take second onearadhana sarin chief financial officer great thank james question obviously early year know generally update provide color guidance first quarter seen reported result underlying trend revenue product sale strong across board also mentioned uncertainty rue also mentioned well dave uncertainty remainder year however momentum continues way first quarter uncertainty vbp pricing etc favor think product revenue product sale alliance revenue could upper end range higher updating guidance point continue invest rd long term including acquired product continue invest sga drive top line momentum seen operating leverage continues focus u seen quarter well revenue growth sga growth try maintain stronger revenue growth expense growth coming quarter well maybe sharonsharon barr executive vice president biopharmaceuticals research development sure thank question azd oral glp receptor agonist really excited molecule potential treat interrelatedness cardiometabolic cardioredisease asked specifically phase study sure aware completed together ecogene highly controlled inpatient phase earlier year data hand look forward presenting upcoming medical conference later year also asked view competitive position molecule recognizing highly competitive field feel optimistic potential molecule standalone well combination think treating obesity metabolic health think honestly disservice referring obesity would like u think clearly treating interconnectedness disease end uniquely well positioned combine orally available molecule molecule portfolio help address interrelated disease example combining sglt inhibitor think imagine fixed dose may want one dose would compatible fixeddose combination another dose would compatible additional weight loss obesity indication keep mind continue design clinical development program moving forward publicly stated launching two phase b study later year one obesity one type diabetespascal soriot chief executive officer thank sharon james asked question door got remember everybody need lose amount weight target higher weight loss sharon talking obesity segment would expect go titration regimen get higher dose surprising would explore dos depending loss patient needing next question seamus fernandez guggenheim seamusseamus fernandez guggenheim partner analyst great thanks question guess pascal little bit preview upcoming analyst event hoping could provide u little bit color thinking potential updated guidance important factor meeting really giving helping u understand longterm visibility around revenue margin little bit second question think three product highlighted biopharma side business oral pcsk glp longacting amylin hoping could help u help provide context around excited perhaps might see data threepascal soriot chief executive officer thanks james first question investor day guess would like invite join u beautiful cambridge see detail going present answer question little bit essentially want show people looking call today tomorrow day today intend deliver term financial progression tomorrow product going launch drive growth strategy intend pipeline product believe growth driver day tomorrow really sort post period believe technology shape future medicine oncology beyond building platform help u shape participate shaping future medicine therapy area really want investor day also offer early riser physically site also give chance look around site experience little bit site second question let give couple comment maybe ruud sharon could add always excited product advanced data three product course exciting data pcsk exciting product also data oral group glp longacting amylin technically interesting need data certainly far look pretty good think actually sharon said combination glp rest pipeline pcsk also dapa also potentially boxplot make difference segment patient need lose weight also manage cardiovascular risk factor obese segment people need lose weight look combining overall glp longacting amylin mechanism sharon want maybe also add little bit see pipelinesharon barr executive vice president biopharmaceuticals research development sure jump people often ask molecule excited find difficult answer obviously invested first one asked oral pcsk inhibitor extremely excited potential molecule releasing phase data upcoming condom near future think safe say set high bar molecule asked able meet major unmet medical need know despite highintensity statin half patient cardiovascular disease hitting ldl target asked molecule able offer substantial lowering top statin encouraged data see actively moving forward molecule clinical development thrilled sharing data upcoming conference relatedly asked obesity portfolio think would really think optimal weight management portfolio exploring incretin nonincretin pathway multiple mechanism manage weight interrelated cardiometabolic cardiorenal disease positioned go beyond shortterm weight loss deliver longterm weight management healthy lean mass management addressing cardiometabolic risk also organ protection think able achieve driving forward multiple mechanism combination thinking incretin pathway discussed earlier nonincretin pathway example longacting amylin longacting amylin imagine different route administration think could offer additive benefit outside already seeing incretin pathway accelerating several asset phase spoke earlier azd longacting amylin acd dual receptor agonist added molecule progressing phase look forward sharing readypascal soriot chief executive officer thanks sharon ruud anything want addruud dobber executive vice president

question sachin jain bank america first one today truqap strong first quarter initial launch feedback going try go roche talked billion pik yesterday wonder could talk relative profile asset related whether would go big billion breast size prostate opportunity pascal specifically called second question susan avanzar due see data informs confidence timing trop biomarker data focus tlo asco think daiichi commented last quick question sharon statinnow plus still plan interim next yearpascal soriot chief executive officer dave want startdave fredrickson executive vice president oncology business sure thanks sachin question truqap really pleased launch following real positive reception presentation data seen uptake really moving quite nicely think uptake biomarker population really speaks need extend endocrinebased therapy see testing rate well established ng yous got previous standard care pik seeing rapidly get displaced still plenty opportunity continue grow within segment demand good start though think certainly much opportunity u continue grow late line bolus probably seeing within number well think underlying demand indication got strong specific question also around comparison anova data understanding think first take look inclusion criterion inclusion criterion certainly different study study inclusion criterion include patient progressed within month adjuvant et completion also limited pikca patient population take look within context really de novo nonearly relapsers second line post cdk plus ai setting addition fast progressors see like threequarters patient falling de novo nonearly relapser population enthusiastic opportunity breast cancer enthusiastic opportunity also prostate cancer think put two together got potential truqap multi blockbustersusan galbraith executive vice president oncology research development ok thanks dave avanzar yes said trial going well trop biomarker data expect would able share data congress within next month certainly far asco go one thing beyond lung cancer data would encourage take look ispy data neoadjuvant study breast cancer looking combination dapa imfinzi setting think continue happy profile seeing data plus io across firstline setting lung cancer safety looking reasonable got many patient enrolled firstline setting move combination earlier line like new adjuvant setting think safety efficacy profile look encouraging would point ascopascal soriot chief executive officer thanks susansharon barr executive vice president biopharmaceuticals research development last question believe plantersen cardio transform trial expected time line readout one mentioned earlier today remain extremely optimistic excited potential molecule showed early data came neurottransform study demonstrated benefit cardiac structure function give u additional confidence potential molecule walk cardiottransform study molecule potential bestinclass transform care patient amyloidosis end would like give trial best chance success able read full trial week time point mind continue scan competitive landscape make appropriate decision move forwardpascal soriot chief executive officer thank sharon touching part question never comment know interim analysis course either next question tim anderson wolfe tim youtim anderson wolfe research analyst hi thanks hopeful question data update thinking lung filing yous overall survival data continues directionally supportive fall little bit upperend threshold one enough get yous approval would mean exyous approval next survival look going incur second question emerging market china obviously slowed year ago lot company really stand result nonchina emerging market segment substantial continuing grow clear driver term geography product therefore future growth expectation nonchina market could add commentary would helpfulpascal soriot chief executive officer thank maybe susan could take first onesusan galbraith executive vice president oncology research development yes tropionlung study obviously announced filed obviously regulatory authority o lung cancer important component want look said timing o data cut around middle year know already saw overall trend favor o data arm itt also saw nonsquamous group positive trend upper end comp interval crossing one looking hoping see continue improve think important piece regulatory authority look thank youpascal soriot chief executive officer thank susan second one maybe leon online believe leon actually comment oneleon wang executive vice president international yes think actually across geographic astrazeneca emerging market growing rapidly almost exception course currency depreciation certain country overall still strong growth also line global new product
