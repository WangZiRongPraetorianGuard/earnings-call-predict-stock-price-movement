operatorthank operator instruction first question come steve fleishman wolfe research please go aheadsteve fleishman wolfe research analyst yeah hi thank first question press report potential another adcvd case filed related solar panel biden also talking getting rid protection bifacial panel tariff could talk little bit positioned deal case arise change arise thanksjohn ketchum chairman president chief executive officer nextera energy sure steve john go ahead take let take order let talk first speculation around adcvd filing may may occur bifacial exemption first adcvd bottom line takeaway folk expect trade action would occur time around manageable several reason going go like circumvention circumvention solar panel market different spot first point want make expect trade action occur result delivery stoppage event panel delivered well advance construction give u lot time opportunity able troubleshoot issue arise think stoppage going occur time around main reason yous expensive solar panel market world lot economic reason delivery continue occur second point want make given scale appropriate incentive contractual protection place agreement supplier ensure delivery occurs timely also put egg one basket diversified set supplier would expect ability pivot one supplier another issue occur feel like good spot third point want make one hit prepared remark yous global supply solar panel bigger ever growing let talk example yous market specifically yous domestic solar panel industry getting stronger stronger ever one point made also prepared remark end solar panel module capacity yous gigawatts expected gigawatts time get yous market much different spot already gigawatts new yous solar panel factory announcement made talk yous domestic solar panel manufacturer sold certainly trouble demand point want make let u speculate little bit filing made around antidumping let deal first find hard believe panel dumped yous market law would applied said yous expensive solar panel market world two three time higher market world panel dumped could case first point want make antidumping second point want make countervailing duty claim filed department commerce would first look see price solar module southeast asian country example subsidized really idea way knowing see get filed see argument able make better assessment countervailing duty historically look example countervailing duty applied past china supplier typically around even applied case quite manageable point want make different tariff situation would prospective retroactive reason even something move forward still way knowing well positioned manage like always inventory position contractual protection place expected give u strong coverage backlog time yous production come online expected trade issue fall away adcvd let turn quickly couple minor comment bifacial exemption bottom line bifacial exemption even removed really impact nextera contracted panel need february minimal exposure bifacial exemption removed bifacial exemption even removed would expire end february brought reinstated another eight year feel like good spot last point make yous production capacity come online actually available continue source yous supplier look put thing together feel like manageable feel like finesteve fleishman wolfe research analyst thorough helpful thank john guess one question data
