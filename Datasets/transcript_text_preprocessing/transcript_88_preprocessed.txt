jefferies please go aheadakash tewari jefferies analyst hey high level past know team tried position biontech earnings growth story mind best estimate biontech returning consistent profitability something occur covid flu enters market tied oncology pipeline separately would look work largecap partner launch adcs broader oncology pipeline would look build commercial sale force internally thanks muchryan richardson chief strategy officer yeah thanks akash question start maybe second part think strategic partnership one hallmark inaudible approach oncology early also covid think continue evaluate partnership asset asset see could help u accelerate certain asset broaden reach geographically even help u reach profitability sooner specific asset might partner brings infrastructure relevant generally speaking though strong balance sheet want retain economics general matter strategy think partnering decision going really made assetbyasset basis time commit actually build commercial presence oncology major market going priority next couple year let jens speak little bit profitability point say high level outset see alluded opportunity pipeline building advancing latestage study deliver longterm sustained growth driven successive product launch indicated significant time point plan really plan go beyond put target approval oncology highlighting think revenue growth come multiple indication approval multiple product priority get longterm growth trajectory course profitable important focus right really getting growth trajectoryjens holstein chief financial officer yeah thanks ryan think made important statement already mean look revenue development going forward course see potential upside covid flu combination reaching market big upside could clear yet given guidance ongoing year combination got see evolves term spend think shown control cost good sensible want create value investing oncology portfolio lift think ryan made statement already looking course partner regionally lift value going forward optimistic term growth front u companyryan richardson chief strategy officer yeah think hearing u akash short term think covid combination vaccine

year first validation databill maughan ubs analyst thanksoperatorthank go next question next question come line hartaj singh oppenheimer please go aheadhartaj singh oppenheimer company analyst great thank thank question want ask question slide got listed average quarterly patient enrollment last couple year seen actually real difficulty company oncology vast number trial going oncology io recruiting patient seen really nice acceleration first quarter put color behind meat bone exactly ability trial getting irb approved trial actually moving ahead late stage maybe spending patient recruiting trial site love hear change thinking potential readout mean nice see improvement enrollment translate readout could actually happen thank youyouğyou şahin cofounder chief executive officer yes let take first part question timeline course dealt early clinical trial typically recruiting lower number patient defining based escalation cohort safety assessment biomarker assessment reaching phase multiple trial phase first clinical trial phase naturally allow u enroll faster ensure get statistic also reason able move multiple clinical trial registration trial end year registrational trial provide timeline expect readout ryan alluded first readout first potential registration trial endometrial cancer next year second half mid next year opportunity get notarization end next year multiple interim readout presented asco esmo sitc year currently running cohortsozlem tureci cofounder chief medical officer may add pointed quite correctly patient recruitment becomes difficult fortunate situation richness different asset thereby design space choose asset combination trial give u several hit target become multiproduct oncology company clear u beginning also mean improve capability execute clinical trial invested bar chart show invested major effort mature clinical development operation organization also grow also invested model working partner partner company enroll
