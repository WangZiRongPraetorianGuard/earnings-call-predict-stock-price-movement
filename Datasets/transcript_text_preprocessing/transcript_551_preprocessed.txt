business change believe transition fully consumptionoriented business alongside category leadership put u excellent position capture billion data streaming platform opportunity front u would like spend minute reflect increasing recognition data streaming category potential growth one way thinking data technology break two group oriented handling data rest database storage system oriented handling data motion two area different evolutionary path last several decade data rest become highly concentrated around powerful infrastructure platform database billionplus category landscape datainmotion technology remain highly fragmented technology analyst recognizing disparate technology category including message queue application integration tool data integration tool event broker etl product ipaas reason largely technological product category defined technological limit whether latency scale complexity processing ease use potential data streaming collapse fragmentation datainmotion technology create new data platform supersedes limited precursor since confluent creation central thesis data streaming platform would data platform similar importance scale database

category become missioncritical component modern data stack forrester wave streaming data platform q recognizes streaming data pulse enterprise name confluent leader also named leader forrester wave cloud data pipeline q infoworlds technology year data management streaming technology category taken together recognition show u data streaming era confluent clear leader discussed data streaming platform kafka kafka data stream foundational layer start extract full value data motion organization need connect system process data real time govern flow data across enterprise capability connector stream processing governance path become sizable business one key aspect consumption transformation let u gotomarket directly drive consumption around additional product used consumption contract additional purchasing friction today would like spend minute covering happening world stream processing stream processing enables organization act data arrives rather waiting process batch end day airline could processing data stream flight time weather information customer information stream powerful stream processing stream combined enriched drive logistics pricing scheduling cascade information throughout system minimize travel disruption confluent represents significant growth opportunity today spend application around data stream significantly higher stream making application easier build bringing spend platform believe adoption platform well growth business accelerated would like spend next minute addressing question confluent uniquely positioned succeed stream processing flink offering three key reason address first flink emerging de facto standard second company stream get processing third rise data product let address turn first reason perhaps obvious believe flink simply best technology space attracted largest community developer working realtime apps technological superiority come fact flink designed full processing power database designed ground streaming addressing batch processing need special case stream processing affect every aspect design storage managed failover fault tolerance work latency result interface presented user dramatically better attempt bolt streaming feature existing database batchprocessing engine result ability offer complete platform ecosystem stream processing one support sql well native apps popular programming language unifies batch realtime processing platform attracted vibrant community development space developer spoken like kafka technology choose need realtime streaming nearly million unique downloads flink increase open job requisition flink developer unlike kafka proven one sophisticated user base including company like apple capital one netflix stripe uber perhaps impressive flink attracted broad adoption apex user without significant commercial backing gotomarket support truly best engineer taking best technology investment flink give u leadership position winning technology stream processing advantage limited technology developer community attractive stream processing stand alone always adopted along stream data need processing everyone agrees kafka standard stream leader kafka prime position capturing emerging stream processing market indeed pairing similar made database successful database brought together data storage data processing unified product driving vastly simpler experience confluent working toward unifying data streaming kafka stream processing via flink believe resulting data streaming platform exactly product customer want pairing skin deep either confluent make stream processing layer work together coherent product optimized single system performance security data discoverability transactional semantics think processing layer unified underlying stream going easiest fastest obvious choice developer make confluent flink offering kind default option come processing data kafka final trend support confluent position stream processing increasing role reusable data product modern data architecture classical data architecture data largely lived silo extracted single destination data warehouse processed clean make usable various reporting analytics use case modern data architecture data warehouse longer single destination data dozen even hundred system feed critical data stream repeating processing clean data use dozen hundred time completely infeasible result processing pulled upstream destination source produce highquality reusable data product rather dozen destination system try clean data instead source responsible publishing data processed readytouse format destination mean processing happening stream data enters system rather destination pulling workload batch processing destination stream processing source structurally expect bulk stream processing happen destination system like database data warehouse data lake think three reason powerful enough draw processing workload data streaming platform put together make dsp

would say two change first increasingly use case need system become part operational stack company use data driving action reporting think require thing much sync current state world think trend overall direction secondly cost real time cost streaming difficulty much coming line batch computing reason harder newer right take time mature yeah felt like hey without making lot really big assumption look kind portion workload average enterprise would streaming platform would say third maybe third live kind operational database world quick lookup serving interactive web apps maybe third kind analytics world kind backend dash inaudible really need move kind offline processing maybe third stream processing space think end state aiming look company little technologically advanced look

notice right payment model kind business model consumptionoriented since prior ipo might notice anything customer hopefully noticed field team helpful finding application critical success making sure get production quickly possible hopefully already consumption incentive kind directly drive behavior would something send notice something changing really internal operation change apparent second point think hear complexity around kafka around flink think actually important separate operational complexity trying build big inhouse data system selfmanage actually using one cloud service interface kafka simple kind read write data stream interface flink sql people used kind common language database common programming language similar construct developer interface complicated want stand build inhouse data platform run open source yes lot rocket science involved think affect sale model well part bringing right value cloud platform particular taking way depend service think call complexity new stuff lie always true like running database hard running data system kind hard stuff different thatshane xie right thanks kash take next question pinjalim bora jp morgan followed mizuhopinjalim bora jp morgan analyst thanks thanks guy thanks question congrats quarter want ask gotomarket change think heard already put kind initial change place maybe go little bit deeper rolled remaining sale enablement side seems like conversation sale rep also change bit looking use casedriven versus committed contract maybe talk rolled remainingjay kreps cofounder chief executive officer yeah yeah kind set thing need change high level compensation structure change track sale force change tracking individual application workload kind highlevel contract progressing intentional let u u really explicitly drive back yes bit different motion enablement around done rolled new system changed compensation kind managing driving run enablement obviously big focus sale kickoff mean

opensource thing yes given adoption stats flink smaller kafka similar growth trajectory think earnings call ago kind plotted relative adoption two project yes certainly doubledigit percentage customer base already us opensource playpinjalim bora jp morgan analyst thank youshane xie thanks pinjal take next question gregg moskowitz mizuho followed td cowen gregg gregg moskowitz mizuho security analyst great ok thank taking question net new logo lighter typical q selfservice activity really slow upcoming gotomarket transition consumption factor also sounded like nice bounce back net new logo january additional color would helpful welljay kreps cofounder chief executive officer yes would say one accurate observation would say one mostly mechanical one consumption change impact q one change made q incented kind booking cloud platform starting q starting january directly incenting land new logo expand kind consumption yes going close small new customer late december might want january get paid yes see bit shift good start noted script january think trajectory rest year think opportunity really drive higher velocity land customer part goal consumption transformation one area going watching try see like significant growth course yeargregg moskowitz mizuho security analyst helpful thanks jay rohan subscription gross margin continue impress fact total gross margin well prior current say longterm guidance anything sort one time nature contained within gross margin today unlocking efficiency maybe expected previously rohan sivaram chief financial officer gregg right

done incredible job making sure improving efficiency done delivering product customer one driver look ahead think opportunity u drive higher multitenant mix product obviously going tailwind gross margin looking forward expect would say zip code plus percent longterm target gross margin put take tailwind going efficiency coming multitenant headwind going cloud becomes bigger piece mix expect offset range see right nowgregg moskowitz mizuho security analyst teriffic thank youshane xie thanks gregg final question today come derrick wood td cowen derrick derrick wood td cowen analyst great thanks first jay think guy past talked confluent cloud cheaper selfmanaged open source know company using opensource kafka would think environment focus spend efficiency maybe could see kind rising interest cloud side guess move thing would flag help drive opensource conversionjay kreps cofounder chief executive officer yeah yeah good observation yeah two key thing think observation right like excellent tco two thing think critical get right raise volume conversion one consumption transformation one thing happened think lot organization tamped kind bottomup purchasing interplay productled growth sale team suddenly becomes important key aspect kind designed plan year designed consumption model confluent make sure right setup land customer product convert kind take way little bit help field team think actually incredibly important infrastructure space want able land volume customer first change second change side reducing kind friction adoption technological easy get like may saving also reducing team people actually make change make switch part everything make product drop replacement making easy switch making kind starting cost appealing possible matter lot make payoff payoff time really appealingderrick wood td cowen analyst great rohan biggest cloud revenue upside quarter delivered nearly two year parse put take see notable improvement consumption quarter overly conservative guide perhaps respect two large customer flagged last quarter term headwind doubleclick outperformance quarter telling around consumption trend heading rohan sivaram chief financial
