caller simon flannery morgan stanley may go ahead line open simon flannery morgan stanley analyst great thank much two could first one revenue guidance think analyst day talked revenue guidance macro condition causing lower end year talked past charles exploring opportunity u xscale hyperscale market update thought therecharles meyers president chief executive officer sure thanks question simon yeah look would say overall demand signal think remains strong reference script continue see characterizing crosscurrent business seen create varying level revenue headwind past quarter really three source would say first two really related macro mentioned last one bit equinix specific first think bit extension sale cycle q bit similar saw q saw deal slippage really seen q q thought served better spot lot lost deal number deal got pushed one quarter affected quarter exit rate second saw churn slightly elevated think toward high end range really reflects continuation optimization activity candidly others across infrastructure space highlighting throughout last one would say little specific u think continue grapple capacity constraint key market hit u gross booking since really accommodate larger footprint requirement market hit u churn side case work try free capacity using churn seen certainly market like singapore factor combined give u little lighter q therefore little bit lower exit run rate know recurring revenue business kind put behind power curve full revenue guide come little bit analyst day range saw lot thing think feel good given xscale strength think saw strong booking performance retail sweet spot healthy pipeline starting see sign emergence even bigger airelated pipeline continue upbeat longterm opportunity importantly think despite lower revenue guide think continuing see robust pricing really driving operating leverage business continues really translate attractive return capital growing dividend affo per share performance really top end

xscale yes absolutely working going continue aggressive market think opportunity know tune tune specifically changed bit last couple year think positioned really continue get significant economic strategic benefit advancing investment hard work nothing specific report think hear u near future thatsimon flannery morgan stanley analyst thanks lot helpfuloperatorand next caller aryeh klein bmo capital market may go ahead line open aryeh klein bmo capital market analyst ok thank maybe ai front clearly momentum accelerating curious think tam particularly relative billion outlined analyst day maybe nvidia dgx offering meaningful become something ultimately offer anywhere beyond market initially targeted charles meyers president chief executive officer yeah mean ai really interesting one think massive opportunity think similar people seeing see hugely promising moving quickly still pretty darn early overall cycle clearly major factor xscale leasing obviously record booking expect going continue see lot strength informing bit desire lean investment would say yet proving inflect retail booking said kind little shorter wanted seeing green shoot saw great early win retail side last quarter term network node support largescale training requirement service provider talked really good enterprise win looking really enterpriselevel training well inference really unlock full power ai ecosystem think nvidia dgx private cloud managed service really distinctive offering seeing big pipeline build nvidia front think broad range think offer around world continue expand time think hugely exciting opportunity asked tam mean said analyst day think tam huge think probably bigger set think look possible impact kind seeing term early return ai think going continue see lot investment flow think tam probably bigger outlined think key u really distinctively differentiated yes think going get piece xscale side think differentiated position u long term unlocking power ai ecosystem sort cloud adjacent set offering digital service side cloud adjacent storage fabric cloud router sort hitting sweet spot think customer really looking control enterprise data ability access ai tool hyperscalers innovating rapidly area stitch together make work way make sense fabric cloud router fabric cloud adjacent storage thing really play continue optimistic would say tempering expectation think going take little time really fully realize term booking flowaryeh klein bmo capital market analyst thanks coloroperatorour next caller jon atkin rbc may go ahead line open jon atkin rbc capital market analyst thanks much churn commentary anything call term region saw product mainly cabinet crossconnects othercharles meyers president chief executive officer yeah would say cabinet power crossconnect turn looking lot like last several quarter jon growth activity continues strong think seeing grooming particularly network service provider segment business bit challenged think really focused cost reduction seeing consolidation higher speed bit bit headwind think elevation bit cabinet power cabinet side really related primarily think people resizing footprint way aligns immediate need think think time people saying hey need going hang think case seen people lot pressured budget part think actually related guy asked u lot question ppi around would create elasticity seen would consider traditional elasticity demand sort heard coming sale team pressure say hey ate budget ppi grow expected want thing looking ai front got find room typically contracting footprint really dynamic seeing let give little color couple area one singledigit percentage churn full customer churn rest people moving around resizing footprint kind activity quite encouragingly said well let u look customer churning tell activity level across rest platform quite encouragingly part finding customer buying elsewhere tandem optimization work think really dynamic term would say seen little europe jon probably little large footprint population think seeing little heavier guide sort assumes going continue see first half year attenuation back half jon atkin rbc capital market analyst got secondly curious xscale initiative growth path america kind put take pursuing organically versus inorganicallycharles meyers president chief executive officer yeah mean think focused right organic would necessarily open inorganic think tougher thing term identifying asset think multiple thing trading pretty heady say least plenty competition asset think primarily focused organic circumstance condition change one balance sheet always ready think would open think focus probably organic sidejon atkin rbc capital market analyst thanks muchoperatorand next call michael rollins citi may go ahead michael rollins citi analyst thanks good afternoon first following point making customer optimization think past used analogy managing retail data center like tetri board fitting different piece deployment together optimization share opportunity resell space power capacity get back play dynamic secondly curious could unpack constantcurrency organic growth range xpower term stabilized growth would within stabilized think price arpu component relative volume component thanks charles meyers president chief executive officer yeah ok maybe keith jump second part tag team bit let catch first one first yes absolutely right many year talked business bit tetri game term figuring get optimal return capacity would tell think given increasing price environment given tendency churn bit biased toward large footprint side thing generally see churn value accretive time mean want sometimes need actually may sort work get happen said happens sometimes singapore market like inherently tradeoff growth rate return invested capital seeing even highdemand market vacancy drag mean time frame take really fully replace churn new revenue particularly true replacing single large foot implementation large number smaller deal seeing probably little longer vacancy drag maybe would thought think kind positive marktomarket opportunity exists improving business mix always central ability deliver increasing mrr per cab return investment sort stabilized asset performance importantly ffo per share sometimes revenue headwind u see churn think positive aspect well look look stabilized asset absent ppi range includes selling interconnection probably ton additional volume growth operating reasonably high level utilization think going see positive price marktomarket think going see continued interconnection sort probably traditional range rest growth going come broader footprint including nonstabilized asset probably growing slightly higher rate keith anything add thatkeith taylor chief financial officer yeah michael let add maybe quick point always said think stabilized asset grow sort constantcurrency normalized basis quarter range power price increase going feel seeing year couple thing neutralized currency neutralized intent purpose power price decrease going roughly basispoint impact mean power price impact sort growth rate little bit really focusing really timing ok somebody really focusing timing charles alluded little bit higher churn entered exited year little bit higher churn front end year look back end year actually get much attractive growth rate start year blend basically got growth rate overall sort look business extremely strong pipeline taking consideration think timing delay although reasonable booktobill interval still think speed thing converting pipeline billable event taking longer thing would say nonrecurring revenue intent purpose going roughly flat year year going move around quarter quarter talked q rich q still pretty darn good closed two large asset xscale space january get fee think important understanding richness pipeline timing year envision exit give u confidence continue drive value ffo per share number give growth charles meyers president chief executive officer well mike would say short story think way think stabilized asset balance going really need come broader portfolio probably going le marktomarket juice think come part juice marktomarket opportunity stabilized asset one going rolling probably little le nonstabilized portfolio newer contract probably le gap going continue drive volume gross booking sidemichael rollins citi analyst thanks detailschip newcom director investor relation thanks mikeoperatorour next caller david barden bank america may go ahead david barden bank america merrill lynch analyst hey guy thanks taking question two could real quick charles talking hybrid private public cloud infrastructure longest time brought new term heard private ai wondered could maybe elaborate little bit compare contrast understanding hybrid private public cloud private ai architecture look like far equinix concerned second keith last quarter talked lot cabinet eight cab per cab consumption evolving potential bring new number forefront would something like cabinet equivalent billing number could kind elaborate little bit looked like fourth quarter evolving disclosure thank youcharles meyers president chief executive officer thanks david yeah private ai think strong similarity difference think private cloud hybrid cloud think dynamic quite similar fact looking industry survey recently given showed based discussion respondent implementing genai respondent public cloud exclusively private cloud exclusively balance hybrid private cloud public cloud folk public many one public cloud dynamic think actually going take shape even maybe faster sort saw cloud large play last several year think end state going going much bigger number word much larger number people going sort prosecuting ai agenda public private infrastructure would say talk private ai happens lot really focused people want place data desire sometimes proprietary nature data controlling etc sometimes cost moving data public cloud factor including performance private ai seeing people saying look want maintain control enterprise data want place somewhere cloud adjacent hyperscalers innovating rapid rate want use model tool broader ecosystem outside hyperscalers also evolving people want connect cloud adjacent storage equinix fabric fabric cloud router incredible tool mix colo opportunity might need place gpu infrastructure kind thing really see essence private ai opportunity think seem taking shape way really positive u go ahead second piece know question david figured one might coming keith taylor chief financial officer yeah david relates new metric continuing review data set team clear exactly need presented comfortably put market consistent basis one thing thinking give sense ready primetime yet looking density threshold extent certain amount density required threshold modify cabinet know report cabinet equivalent basis thinking think cabinet probably best representation get sense utilizing asset said think continue quite transparent overall density cabinet sold see sort trend line spent energy thinking power price feel like right metric sharing given nature business model relative others know retail player different type metric sure valuable metric looking forward going continue work absolutely sort ready go think sometime first half year either adjusted metric different view going represent fill ratesdavid barden bank america merrill lynch analyst right guy thanks updateoperatorour next question michael elia td cowen may go aheadmichael elia td cowen analyst great thanks taking question two may one question get investor whether gpubased compute distance remediating cpubased compute legacy data center designed lower cabinet density able handle seeing customer swapping cpu gpus existing data center deployment mitigate essentially obsolescence existing facility first question second question along similar vein ai inference thought model need sit proximate data candidly life within facility although think also question whether cpubased gpubased look capture demand inference standard data center design guy evolving power density perspective cooling architecture standpoint color would helpful thank youcharles meyers president chief executive officer lot thanks question michael thing obviously topic discussion around equinix various place think look gpus sort something much special purpose dedicated compute go beyond traditional cpu realm mean think clear trend said think world thing compute thing ai necessarily done gpus think going range player think continue evolve compute side thing provide chip meet various purpose ai realm term seeing massive shift cpu gpu typically seeing people adopting gpus parallel think even thing currently gpucentric think time may actually well served either current future generation cpu seeing big obsolescence trend relates little bit second part question think inference training would say evolution data center design need respond thing would say acute nearterm evolution training side substantially power dense require think different thinking around power density cooling support think much higher average density design would probably put forward xscale buildout would acute representation nearterm change inference side think broadly retail side seeing power density rise slower rate think ability implement liquid cooling long access chilled water loop ability get liquid cooling facility support highdensity implementation quite high fact announced large number market around world think good position think face situation going meaningful obsolescence even significantly dated asset especially implement liquid cooling inside facility think thing continue track think going top mind u probably overall pace change design going increase next decade one prior suremichael elia td cowen analyst thanks color appreciate charlescharles meyers president chief executive officer bet michaeloperatorthe next caller matt niknam deutsche bank may go ahead matt niknam deutsche bank analyst hey guy thanks taking question keep brief two followup number one guide expectation churn guess improve slightly second half anything seeing term visibility anything guiding expectation improvement secondly term macro talked guess deal slippage dynamic resemble maybe q saw q update term guess halfway q deal closed still color guess see first six week year thanks charles meyers president chief executive officer yeah let take one first matt business closed closed quickly immediately quarter sort natural turn event commit q rolled q quarter forward little lost lost little really primarily push forward said q unfortunately look little like q would prefer look lot like q q dynamic think hard fully predict customer sentiment hear customer one yes tighter budget yes continuing optimize boy sure committed digital side thing yes want talk ai yes want figure place data think thing take little time translate firm booking trajectory feel comfort level around mitigation churn one good visibility pipeline fact large deal churn gotten good forecasting saw little bit midsized churn q contributed elevation think keep eye closely ton offer particular view think think realistic u based hearing term appetite customer would see abatement churn second half add one comment used would say think scarcity mindset relative data center capacity really changed pretty meaningfully macro condition changed sort desire tighten budget desire kind offset impact ppi think play hearing different appetite higher degree optimization would say think seeing front end though customer least talked u turning back capacity sort come back say yeah put back market yet sure want give capacity market first time think heard kind mindset typically larger service provider think going probably see starting see front end macro think would probably see improving interest rate course year think would see generally improved macro environment think sort informing guidancematt niknam deutsche bank analyst great thank operatorour next caller richard choe jp morgan may go aheadrichard choe jpmorgan chase company analyst hi wanted follow competitive environment seeing deal go competitor market tight pushed outcharles meyers president chief executive

solid value proposition think compete effectively certain market think starting see also people thinking want allocate workload overall share wallet continues question term people thinking spend going forwardrichard choe jpmorgan chase company analyst term pricing action year kind implied guidance expect price increase interconnection year charles meyers president chief executive officer yeah mean think overall seeing really robust pricing environment right probably many put forward number price increase think evaluating price increase interconnection u market overall think certainly one contributing factor ability continue drive growth business think firm pricing also really think informing really critical overall message degree confidence really attractive guide improving
