construction burnstone collapsed sincere condolence go family friend lost colleague think number fatal incident experienced deeply regrettable think took hard toll team since implementing fatal elimination strategy think many underlying trend show u progressing well along journey strategy heart really look eliminating high energy highrisk incident mitigate risk critical control behavior also management routine make sure enable safe work trend seen tell u right journey would instance serious injury frequency rate use measure since energy involved serious incident quite often similar could result fatal seen consistent yearonyear decline many serious injury frequency rate experienced last year industryleading certainly record tell u right trend also think last year first time saw frontline stoppage safety stoppage frontline employee exceeded number safety stoppage saw management safety officer important really tell u two thing firstly frontline employee able identify risk within working area importantly developing culture frontline supervisor stopping safety incident rather continuing work embraced really seen part overall commitment working unsafe environment also seen real reduction risk historically top incident resulted fatality fall ground gone month without seeing fall ground incident showing u control implemented able eliminate fatality remain absolutely confident continue implement strategy drive throughout organization show deeplevel mining possible without fatal incident moving social think charl highlight formation sibanyestillwater foundation last year think key achievement toward delivering ultimate vision shared stakeholder value specific foundation allocated first fund south african region last year disimbursed first set fund two esteemed partner gift giver breadline africa specific foundation really aimed uplifting community around operation also many employee originate focus infrastructure gift giver working u uplifting

total unit cost last year increased zar per e ounce significantly inflation mining ppi experienced across industry course given u benefit continuing move industry cost curve increasing resilience overall pgm environment facing present cost performance largely come back two thing first one tight stringent cost control also increased focus delivering additional byproduct benefit notably chrome
