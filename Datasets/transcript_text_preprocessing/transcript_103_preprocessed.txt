probably best get number point simply program still would say much flux go toward back half year working way john said changing lot activity hardly activity going callon acreage later year changing callon plan imagine four week still bit flux maybe share bit clarity thing like second quarter earnings call august think would better bit solidify remaining plan year general statement believe good capital efficiency general carrying lot ducs value ducs basic need logistics matching frac schedule drilling schedule believe capital efficiency tremendous amount duc inventoryjohn christmann president chief executive officer thing would add obviously believe capital productivity improve callon portion especially go modification workflow back half year combined company going improve seeing productivity apache side right get callon asset toward back half yeardavid deckelbaum td cowen analyst appreciate could make first two question guess one ask another one curious share target might mind proceeds timing noncore asset salessteve riney executive vice president chief financial officer specific target mind recognize even progress made debt apache corp knew needed make progress make

next year quite frankly egypt continues compete permian play wellbetty jiang barclays analyst great thank thatoperatorthank please stand next question next question come line leo mariani roth mkm line openleo mariani roth mkm analyst wanted follow little bit egypt wanted kind get sense folk situation receivables country saw egypt recently got imf loan little bit ago sure kind improved state financial wellbeing maybe could kind speak also could speak little bit kind expectation gross egyptian oil volume know talked lot sort net look like growth come last quarter expect growth trajectory gross volume trade next couple quarterssteve riney executive vice president chief financial officer ok yes sorry steve yes receivables always said worked closely egyptian government thing like received two payment first quarter year despite receivables especially oil price receivables increased slightly first quarter kind made good progress bringing quarter increased slightly first quarter

pointing mean going easy ride going quick ride thing certainly improving liquidity improving big positive step right direction going help go forward indication egyptian government get large payment second quarter year actually egypt visiting around time receivables changed whole lot first quarter certainly sign thing going egypt pointing improving term gross volume declined two quarter row actually look back gross oil volume pretty flat rose declining fourth quarter first quarter lot around completion timing actually completed new well third quarter last year fourth quarter completed first quarter year necessarily surprise volume oil volume might declining bit quarter see go going forward continuing reduce drilling rig count going effect number well available completion see go quarter quarter year gross oil volume approach yearend john said prior question got work issue balancing workover rig workover capacity drilling capacity efficient use capital drilling new well workover much capital productive drilling new well nothing wrong drilling new well workover cheap normally return quite bit production volume line got make sure capacity stay top workover program got lot idea work ultimately longer term possibility could bring workover rig country lot thing try work get got lot get thing balanced properly functioning properly drilling new well working working way backlog roll give better view egypt goingleo mariani roth mkm analyst right helpful good explanation guess maybe turning suriname quickly wanted kind get better sense kind thing stand know still working toward fid kind confidence level partner achieving later year sound like still drilling happening apache anticipate drilling john christmann president chief executive officer yes would say confident feed still underway would anticipate fid yearend moving forward going dictate timing term drilling got till start exploration program nothing pressing side could back drilling leo mariani roth mkm analyst ok thank youjohn christmann president chief executive officer bet thank leooperatorthank question please standby last question last question come line neil mehta goldman sachs line openneil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning team john wanted spend little bit time talking callon cost synergy specifically operational side talking highgrading service provider stuff around casing surface economics spend time getting u ground giving u little bit granularity around cost synergy operational sidejohn christmann president chief executive officer yes jump let steve add little bit color general changing program going see fewer well per section fewer landing zone larger fracs general thing look well count term complete well callon putting third new well esp gas lift running outside alpine high esp gas lift place term equipping well flowing well producing well obviously power needed drive sub pump another big factor also say turnkey lot stuff mean turnkeyed lot frac operation going selfsource lot stuff lot lowhanging fruit operation side bigticket item already seen lot seen u increase lot operational sidesteve riney executive vice president chief financial officer yes neil would add went back permian slide deck published february specifically pointed three area felt like callon significantly kind mark term would want loe per boe workover cost per boe downtime percent callon history much higher well failure rate including new well higher rate esp failure many around feel around equipping choice already making change proactive basis even well already drilled completed equipped lot inefficiency around compression use compression fleet making across larger set operation make economy scale around compression optimization even rate negotiation compression cost john pointed tendency use lot esp purchase power expensive big contributor loe per boe use lot contract labor lot supply chain aspect using apa rate around service around product using volume discount get across larger operation reducing overall usage high water handling disposal cost believe much better high rate rental rental esp rental compression think better well capital side use technology drill use decrease average drilling day well get better rig rate better job rig move moving rig across basin delaware midland basin use spudder rig generally lot well drill practice normally frac rate get better proppant cost supply chain type stuff facility typically built facility spec typically try modularize typically go multiphase flowing single line like use test separator meter three product three different line think whole bunch stuff going looking reduce loe per boe downtime work costsneil mehta goldman sachs analyst thorough helpful explanation thank team
