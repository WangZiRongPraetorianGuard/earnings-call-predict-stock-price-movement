looking fare previous comp month april looked like could support incremental growth capacity pilot really lowcost incremental flying yeah mean think market could support kind growth fare pressure beyond expected adding seat along side oas minneapolis pretty minneapoliscentric airline first quarter particular sort bright spot u network move summer mean cutting june july month look really good august probably mostly like planned real change longterm opportunity minneapolis think long term reset aircraft utilization producing nine block hour per aircraft per day kind set fleet age focus reliability probably need around eight hour day per aircraft steadystate environment based operational restriction based offpeak performance think probably lower thing change pretty rapidly talking
