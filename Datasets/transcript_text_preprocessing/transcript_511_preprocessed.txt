research may go ahead sirdean rosales wolfe research analyst hi dean rosales justin question medicare risk business wondering seeing term trend specifically special need product many member exactly much revenue product could speak seen term cost year date specifically q thank muchjavier rodriguez chief executive officer thanks dean would highlight risk side medicare advantage think important realize esrd population different broader population trend might seeing payer certainly watch carefully necessarily apply population would highlight three thing first need patient medical cost bear different population given high acuity patient one second would also note reimbursement population run differently separate reimbursement rate come preliminary final rule third coding change apply broader population apply esrd population think early u really full view said feeling pretty good net saving came snp side medicare advantage population within valuebased care term cleanup member snp product term revenue somewhere north milliondean rosales wolfe research analyst thank youoperatorthank next caller pito chickering deutsche may go ahead sirpito chickering deutsche bank analyst yeah good afternoon guy looking guidance assuming loss million ikc refresh u script think talked growth revenue ikc reduction pmpm would noted shifted loss gain metric sort help bridge think shifting cash

revenue accounting historically record revenue comfortable could reasonably estimate share shared saving would true population medicare feeforservice population ckcc program snp product always accounted use word accrual method change talking change timing get comfortable estimate asked really three thing one made change contractual language give u earlier clarity attributed life one second getting data earlier obviously help u calculation earlier third experience got better actuarial model putting three thing together comfortable reasonably predict share shared saving revenue ultimately turn revenue plan year change estimate term asked guiding loss million nongaap number loss million thing realize million includes revenue valuebased care product plan year result estimate change mentioned well revenue product line think way think make little bit applestoapples would back somewhere around million million maybe million make bit applestoapples question pmpm question therepito chickering deutsche bank analyst yeah taking loss million back million million think guided script sort growth ikc reduction pmpm would assume growth reduction would resulted higher operating conversion operating loss kind sort take growth metric cost reduction metric still get million lossjavier rodriguez chief executive officer yeah thing first clarify change referred true medicare advantage business ckcc business still new enough comfortable estimating saving plan year part changed term question cost saving referring related model care ga would call mlr health plan business equivalent u second significant amount positive period development particular snp business forecasting recur would another adjustment think would help bridge question getting profitability next year

optimistic le optimistic impact businessjavier rodriguez chief executive officer thanks question aj know last quarter sort dissertation glp gotten lot conversation end day course wanted make sure shareholder others really well versed think could unusual surprise never want say chance zero highly highly improbable capture range likely play end day expect net neutral impact dialysis volume next decade lot probabilistic adjustment weighted many people would participate normal math discussed want change position bitaj rice ubs analyst ok great maybe could pivot ask assumption around labor going know underlying banking wage benefit permanent worker believe still tailwind contract labor least annualizing ending year whole issue california minimum wage lowwage healthcare worker know said would spending election spending wonder factoring anticipate start impactjavier rodriguez chief executive officer yeah aj thanks labor year called patient care cost growth per treatment would break roughly half labor half stuff labor side thinking something around year california would baked called month ago something around million million net impact fully rolled number rolling little bit quicker anticipated would expect number probably somewhere range baked number reason comfortable patient care cost given half labor growing got saving annualization mircera ship mircera well clinic footprint action took also got fixed cost leverage add volume without adding center lot cost fixed cost grow volume longterm contract feel like despite wage pressure get aj rice ubs analyst ok great thanks lotoperatorthank next caller gary taylor td cowen may go ahead sirryan langston td cowen analyst hi ryan langston gary think dean touched earlier maybe go back higher sort medicare advantage

endstage renal disease choice said continue mindful course work kidney community disability group sort dangerous risk want make sure taken advantage analogy say town hall someone asks much passion like saying door house lock broken said yes one broken little say well still want fix perspective something supreme court said needed clarified champion congress others believe clarified got work process also think discussed verification process admission helped example employer group actually apply found employee actually network change benefit basically reverted back network benefit think sometimes people explore idea without really understanding full ramification case worked well continue put lot energy second question around ballot course liked spending money making sure patient teammate suffer call dangerous ballot process take lot money educate broader state think extremely happy end day instead spending money teammate get benefit relates election cycle talked two election cycle would good time hopefully iron revisit relationship laborlisa clive alliancebernstein analyst great thanks clarificationjavier rodriguez chief executive officer thank lisaoperatorand next caller

center therepito chickering deutsche bank analyst curiosity multiyear period get back kind worth like bps ga leverage kind size would wonderfuljavier rodriguez chief executive officer yeah leverage would see would patient care cost ga fixed cost associated clinic patient care cost would see think best help math would think patient care cost per treatment number right running roughly twothirds
