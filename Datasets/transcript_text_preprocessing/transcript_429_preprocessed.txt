next year ability deliver mission increase significantly meaningful team operator happy take question question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come michael yee jefferies line openmike yee jefferies analyst hey guy good morning thanks question focusing rsv know made number nice comment comparing data maybe could talk two three point one perhaps work commercial market yous contracting contracting season contract work two different competitor secondly would work pharmacy level either patient doctor making selection given fact pfizer gsk similar sale different profile maybe talk two different thing expect play yearstéphane bancel chief executive officer great thank michael stephane term contracting obviously start contracting product approved medical team quite engaged across board medical conference talking healthcare professional sharing great data published december know phase new england journal medicine active discussion quite high excitement possibility product approved get prefilled syringe product discussed remark know labor shortage big issue pharmacy u gone pharmacy fall could see busy sometimes bit hectic leadership big retail pharmacy engaged think covid versus rsv simplify workflow reduce medical error medical discussion far give significant hope product meaningful tool customersoperatorthank next question come gena wang barclays line opengena wang barclays analyst thank two quick question first one regarding rsv vaccine portion participant completed two season regarding february acip meeting additional data presenting quickly guidance better understanding covid rsv market size season could upside downside revenue guidance billionstephen hoge president great thanks gena take first part actually know top head proportion southern northern hemisphere participant enrolled study counting two rsv season depend upon sizable proportion said maximum followup additional analysis month median nine month definition half said participant enroll pretty continuously month exactly evenly pretty close want give inaccurate number would suspect pretty sizable proportion steady pretty consistent enrollment course month exactly equal trended direction far additional data acip meeting obviously continue provide update additional analysis durability obviously immunogenicity data well data across different subpopulation fortunate enough opportunity present acip course listen committee anything would like see well performance mrna vaccine performance vaccine general term durability guide decisionmaking around repeat dosing boosting schedule public healthstéphane bancel chief executive officer thanks stephen gena stephane upside downside sale year think upside obviously covid europe mentioned could participate market last fall new tender opportunity u participate quite number doctor hospital public health leader actually complained moderna vaccine given higher efficacy reported reduction hospitalization available especially elderly immunocompromised people interesting upside course vaccination rate yous reported vaccination rate current ending season lower last year said remark need better protect people team actively already working crossfunctional matter address vcr increase vaccination rate upside could rsv market growth well share quickly get share current two solution available downside course vaccination rate could downside one course timing rsv launch given rely regulator approval product public health recommendation like cdc different different country could course delay launch course impacting salesoperatorthank next question come ellie merle ubs line openellie merle ubs analyst hey guy thanks much taking question turning cmv phase talk little bit would view clinically meaningful commercially relevant vaccine efficacy successful also thinking use seronegative versus seropositive patient thanksstephen hoge president sure thank question cmv obviously currently vaccine prevent infection cmv source devastating birth defect anything provides statistically significant reduction rate infection therefore vertical transmission would think terrific minimum bar powering study support vaccine efficacy approximately shared previously anything would obviously beat expectation incredibly exciting field phase study enrolling seropositive seronegative participant part reason currently broadly used diagnostic want demonstrate benefit safety population believe likely use vaccine could given regardless sero status seronegatives seropositives potential benefit seropositives could include control shedding viremia longterm sequela cmv would prove something exploring explicitly current phase study practical matter labeling perspective launch perspective goal try launch product seropositives seronegative diagnostic needed broadly used across population try prevent devastating effect cmv vertical transmission newborn babiesoperatorthank next question come hartaj singh oppenheimer line openhartaj singh oppenheimer company analyst great thank indicated going complete enrollment cmv year maybe readout walk u step would look like maybe give u idea powering tactical assumptionsstephen hoge president yes course thanks hartaj currently fully enrolled accruing case study think shared actually made substantial progress number case casedriven endpoint need see approximately case first interim analysis efficacy case specific interim analysis track look lot like vaccine efficacy study dsmb evaluate data meet statistical threshold early efficacy meaning better minimum vaccine efficacy moment tell u unblind share result course share broadly world whatever reason quite statistical power first interim analysis actually study powered continue continue recruit case toward final analysis efficacy given rate final analysis case given rate case accrual currently seeing study expect enough case year therefore pretty confident going seeing readout interim analysis possibly even final analysis efficacy since case event driven buy time ultimately depend upon dsmb tell u whether met statistical thresholdoperatorthank next question come luca issi rbc capitalluca issi rbc capital market analyst great thanks much taking question maybe stephen int maybe remind u latest thinking term potential accelerated approval melanoma maybe additional tumor type guy merck thinking maybe talk tumor type contemplating whether tumor type going adjuvant setting metastatic setting maybe rsv quickly maybe expand durability context competitor scenario acip recommends gsk vaccine every year versus vaccine every year color much appreciate thanks muchstephen hoge president ok cool quite question try get apologize forget anyone first question int accelerated approval adjuvant melanoma setting said continue really excited data excited start looking talk regulator three thing tried say true u believe appropriate even ask accelerated approval first see durability clearly data saw december two month ago show durability really clear statistically significant result comparator arm control arm look really like label data incredibly encouraged durability criterion one second third still really important second substantially enroll confirmatory phase study accelerated approval space believe show really already done diligence allow confirmatory data come three four year readout would confirm anything would happen accelerated approval context third perhaps increasingly important criterion establish commercial manufacturing facility announced building facility marlborough massachusetts purposebuilt personalized individualized neoantigen therapy facility ultimately licensed create product world whether accelerated context future whole approval facility coming online look forward hosting many others tour bring online without facility really product talk three essential making progress three think exciting thing alluding durability benefit seeing really cause u lean completing working hard complete enrollment confirmatory study criterion finish buildout marlborough facility third criterion point indication going defer partner merck specific together right time opening additional phase confirmed study expect open multiple year include additional adjuvant indication also include potential metastatic indication looking monotherapy indication either place pd keytruda may indicated even earlier line therapy consideration soon start study begin enrolling course make announcement partner merck lastly question rsv continue really enthusiastic data product think durability shown second large season quite encouraging sharing data acip well first get regulatory process approval country stephane mentioned pdufa date may opportunity sharing data acip includes case booster data immunogenicity ongoing work actually already previously presented publicly meeting like competitor shared data second dose look like term boosting neutralizing antibody titer back one year also going looking two year data well booster similar booster data competitor product likely brought together inform acips recommendation think rsv vaccine readministered booster might necessary really fall committee make determination u question whether expect difference distinction term treat vaccine point given immunogenicity data booster data shared across three product remarkably consistent well consistent picture term efficacy including leading efficacy product second year would suspect continue view product similar therefore continue consistent recommendation really committee make determination least perspective certainly think science would support thatoperatorthank next question come salveen richter goldman sachs line openelizabeth webster goldman sachs analyst hey good morning thank taking question elizabeth salveen two question u first remind u stand evaluating rsv vaccine pediatric population phase cmv vaccine walk u seen durability date thinking durability vaccine particularly relates potential commercial opportunity younger adult womenadolescent population thank youstéphane bancel chief executive officer yes take question rsv pediatrics started study yet course considering taking phase clinic phase waiting data able move right time pediatric setting term cmv data yet durability like done program share data share data including durability important know benefit young woman strong immune system shown int program cell work well term vaccination technology moderna really expect good durability time wait data make determinationoperatorthank next question come geoff meacham bank america line openalex hammond bank america merrill lynch analyst hi alex hammond geoff meacham thank taking question great way equalize vaccine efficacy result use correlative protection rsv think could line sight type metric important could competitive dynamic thank youstéphane bancel chief executive officer good morning stephane stephen hoge president sorry small technical stuff back believe caught end question think correlative protection inform dynamic product boosting correct manufacturer sharing publicly work correlative protection believe identified strong candidate neutralizing antibody surprisingly clinical study sharing data regulator sharing preliminary analysis public health official including advisory group like cib publishing data ultimately submitting regulatory correlate balance year think competitor successful establishing neutralizing antibody rsv correlative protection rsv really probably primary way public health official make determination revaccination boosting ultimately maintain durable protection rsv highrisk population like older adult competitive dynamic perspective product established correlate correlate relate think probably going commonality correlative protection make sense end day still talking virus vaccination three productsoperatorthank next question come terence flynn morgan stanley line openterence flynn morgan stanley analyst great thanks taking question wondering could provide update discussion fda seasonal flu vaccine gating filing herestephen hoge president thanks speaking fda regulator around world would would like see submission perspective first generation influenza program mrna program referenced specific update right conversation speak really want get ahead kind thing talking total submission data package duration followup study additional study data might supportive application conversation ongoing provide update nothing add right nowoperatorthank next question come jessica fye jp morgan line openjessica fye jpmorgan chase company analyst hey guy good morning thanks taking question int talk driving confidence go metastatic setting enrollment going phase melanoma trial know touched manufacturing important status manufacturing scaleup work facility going ready go livestephen hoge president great question take first part first metastatic formally decided announced going metastatic indication data phase study initial phase study metastatic patient including nonsmall cell lung cancer yet made determination going metastatic indication think behind question view would agree extent int going provide really substantial benefit think probably earlier line therapy adjuvant perhaps even stage disease stage disease depending indication safety tolerability profile think incredibly favorable benefit seeing pretty remarkable immune perspective said still really high unmet need metastatic space even immunotherapy like pd like keytruda provide substantial benefit right time may well choose start metastatic indication said metastatic indication setting said yet formally decided today really focused adjuvant earlier monotherapy principally manufacturing process enrollment substantially scaled ability enroll patient phase study assure partner merck would open second phase study talking third confidence ability rapidly meet demand substantial demand clinical research site int manufacturing specifically put number suffice say rapidly enrolling study would expect make substantial progress year even perhaps getting close completing enrollment least one study continues trajectory excited progress made scaling manufacturing clinical supply excited progress making right enrolling patient demand seeing clinical site believe solved lot clinical research clinical development manufacturing requirement question becomes commercial alluded minute ago marlborough site would really become purposebuilt commercial site mean able deliver highquality product high volume also valuable price cost point work ongoing made great progress building site goal establish site least clinical supply year provided guidance fully operational potential commercial use ultimately depends upon discussion regulator welllavina talukdar head investor relation kevin take last
