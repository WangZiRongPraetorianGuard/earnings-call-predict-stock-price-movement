moment next question next question come line timothy arcuri ubs question pleasetimothy arcuri ubs analyst thanks clarification question clarification brice wfe baseline would agree something like billion billion clarify baseline say gain share question china wfe use number implies wfe china roughly billion maybe little bit le know customer stockpiling tool per se know smic public company revenue support spend seems like half amount guess question would disagree idea maybe half coming china company kind getting ground trying displace imported yous europe guess gary real crux question china stuff really free lunch sort duplicative spending happening elsewhere handicap plan business going forward thanksbrice hill chief financial officer ok tim thank wfe careful engage discussion shared view applieds performance view market u strong year talked icaps strength talked dram strength packaging strength etc wait see third party say size market u saw strong market china wfe agree see stockpiling number new customer know exactly partition described term leading public company versus think large number project underinvestment see next four year added wafer start capacity planned wafer start capacity market strong market u across planning horizon think mix got real demand look macro compare amount capacity put place local china consumption think still behind amount local china consumption think investment rational actually utilization look ok lower rest world generally speaking improving expect yield improving also time know gary asking gary free lunch think right perspective capacity planning tool sell whether china whether governmentincentivized project none thing think increase amount equipment installed sort abnormally going used going serve end market believe china demand endline free launch believe government incentive free lunch perspective affecting location needed equipmenttimothy arcuri ubs analyst thanks lotoperatorthank one moment next question next question come line joseph moore morgan stanley question pleasejoseph moore morgan stanley analyst yeah wonder could give u clarity million hbmrelated revenue forecasting actually relatively small portion overall dram run rate least guess would thought would even bigger talk hbm come advanced packaging ai dram people stack type memory hbm kind encompassing advanced packaging opportunity beyond thatbrice hill chief financial officer ok thanks joe dram think going back q first quarter saw elevated dram china demand approximation used impact right going exactly describe every single quarter think good estimate incremental seeing end three straight quarter incremental dram shipping customer china allowed technology gary gary dickerson president chief executive officer
