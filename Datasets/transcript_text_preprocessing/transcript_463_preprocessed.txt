seen term utilization scaled early procedure volume look like top accountsisaac zacharias chief commercial officer sure think even top account germany penetration still relatively low happens germany sufficient payment cover cost product tight linkage hospital administration physician behavior germany tighter think anywhere else except japan happens physician use product administration tell stop stop would get cyclical account using product would turn september would use product administration come back next year say hey used get year product utilization get curtailed smaller account would essentially zero enough money within hospital system cover extra cost administration would clamp really lot headroom germany gaining adoption smaller account kind zero base account really driving appropriate use adoption larger account curtailed administration answer questionmike kratky leerink partner analyst yeah perfect mean one separate followup look like cosiraii ctgov giving primary

executive officer ok make little challenging biggest reason historically economic concern premium device priced level thought reflected value would ultimately lead strong reimbursement position would beneficial hospital thankfully work rob team successful successful securing drgs shocking coronary side cpt code think ultimately also yield sort landing highest apc level coronary initial reaction price oh highpriced device lot anxiety tpt little unusual term reimbursement mechanism always perception among physician really reimbursed even though always reluctance many physician hand mind like use shockwave absolutely expensive device first two three building block eliminating economic anxiety drgs cpt code place think year first year lot economic anxiety ameliorated second another reason reluctant historically got long diffuse lesion going going pull two catheter treat maybe use atherectomy instead shockwave c address long diffuse reluctance also help diffuse sort misperception shockwave le effective eccentric nodular calcium give power treat eccentric lesion one catheter really two big headwind faced biggest economics ultimately think last one sort next hurdle knock device deliverable deliverable physician would like time choose pull bulkier regular angioplasty balloon use something else fix arrow got year knocking remaining remaining pressure point capped utilization
