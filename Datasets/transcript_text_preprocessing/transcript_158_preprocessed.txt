one hand seems like could align current print hand seems like merck gone toward specialty market away kind primary care maybe would love thought dean think building outdean li president merck research lab well thank much yes excited buildout cardiovascular metabolic pointed program visibility right let assure program visibility coming year relationship question glp obesity think two way look look glp angle look obesity angle look glp angle really important work showing impact diabetes weight loss recently cardiovascular outcome recently sleep apnea right interested relationship mash think also important outcome also think distinct population whether call obese whether call mash within glp space distinct relation important give benefit molecule really take care primary concern play example mash think tolerable drug significant reduction liver fat also give weight loss look think different outcome may need different molecule generally talking obesity think work going right think could another wave people start thinking oral tolerable accessibility combination maintain preserve muscle also additional outcome may molecule best molecule win every one subpopulation would wonder fractionation patient population say word example generally obesity wonder opportunity therepeter dannenbaum senior vice president investor relation great thank terence next question please

recommendation v v wonder could talk stack believe phase customized pediatric patientsrob davis chairman chief executive officer yes maybe start daina dean add obviously would start saying pleased overall tone tenor discussion coming acip meeting look v continue believe look strength data behind talked dean mentioned clinical readout come recall cover serotypescausing disease adult higher pcv significant specifically designed targeting serotypes prevalent adult disease result continue believe value proposition v compelling look cost effectiveness going costeffective vaccine result think started see acip ask question age cohort well plus want get ahead acip recommendation would say belief conviction value data value vaccine bring patient pneumococcal space significant would expect overall going see broad coverage coming acipdean li president merck research lab yes would add want respectful acip fda point something think something clearly took notice rob talk versus specific question asked would remind everyone dropping age universal vaccination considered previously vaccine could come situation thought would good idea based cost effectiveness increasing believe changed calculus made renewed interest lowering age based broader coverage given vrob davis chairman chief executive officer think second question daina v maybe give general answer obviously look strategy v strategy v develop investigational pcv vaccine targeted specifically serotypes disease child peds without hopefully causing untoward effect model follows given detail additional serotypes thinking
