seasonality q much higher sequential uptick versus q typically opposite q seems like little bit downtake versus q typically opposite anything onetime q repeat q see kind slightly lower consumption rate versus last quarter maybe seems like got correctly monthly seems like variability little bit drag maybe color would helpful kind think sustainability growth total cloudjanesh moorjani chief financial officer hey pinjalim yeah let unpack know first step back actually pleased overall performance quarter including cloud coming yearoveryear growth broadly speaking would say played expected would think piece first nothing unusual onetime q recur q take table think performance q look performance across segment really well commercial enterprise know salesled motion drive consumption secured commitment smb side predominantly selfserve motion piece remained soft soft little bit time even played expected would basically consistent given relative growth monthly cloud versus rest cloud revenue drove monthly cloud revenue versus prior quarter yearago period would say broadly speaking sale motion actually working quite well term securing initial commitment course working customer ramp consumption think seasonality different element called fact way reflective nature consumption said fluctuate time time think consumption pattern across quarter though would say q generally stable across board mentioned earlier overall look back moving part actually quite pleased cloud performance look forward delivering strong qpinjalim bora jpmorgan chase company analyst understood one followup little bit technical question ash think future rag context expanding context window token llm thinking latter kind eat use case rag cost going basically primary driver people

pattern going continue pattern looking establish predominant pattern going forward primary reason like said two factor one cost continues grow send token context window people building realworld enterprise application definitely something worry rag help control price second think training even refinement model work point stop training put production internal data proprietary data trying build response constantly changing changing millisecond able provide response actually contextual accurate need rag matter reason rag really becoming primary way people build enterprise application feel

think early stage right seen really strong performance business far pleased execution still middle planning process early concrete view revenue outlook focused delivering strong q talk next calltyler radke citi analyst thank followup ash customer example displacing vector database customer reference drawn blank name coding repository company talk maybe decision mean vector pretty early term nascent industry common displacement main factor drove evaluate alternative choose elasticash kulkarni chief executive officer yes thanks tyler customer getting educated everything go building generative ai application seeing core differentiator thing talked past really beginning shine become obvious customer talk customer think customer example gave last quarter whether docusign past cisco time stack overflow consensus standing customer would say roughly four thing first vector database implementation built top siem incredibly good implementation like customer really see u perform well especially term scalability talked kind new innovation driven area around scaler quantization making system perform even better scale even better le intensive term memory requirement vector performance one thing first thing second thing powerful capability enterprise capability delivered product thing like ability document level permission security capability ability use facet search like personalization geolocation really become important building enterprise application third thing becoming popular hybrid search hybrid search mechanism use combination vector search semantic search lexical search use rebanking come relevant answer like customer becoming sophisticated area recognizing incredibly important get right relevance use kind hybrid technique last thing incumbency customer like think elasticsearch broadly spread ecosystem ten thousand customer many familiar using elasticsearch like fact data already platform data platform mean becomes much easier take data quickly create vector embeddings use generative ai application four thing becoming stronger stronger way u differentiate fully expect whole area continues mature strength going become bigger factor u continue winner spacetyler radke citi analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come matt hedberg rbc capital market please go aheadmatt hedberg rbc capital market analyst great thanks taking

overall value investment something enabling u win displace incumbent consolidation motion leaning leaning several quarter seeing benefit itmatt hedberg rbc capital market analyst really really good hear maybe obviously lot talk vector genai usage feel like lot within like enterprise search know app site surge curious extent think vector technology make way sort broad observability security search siemash kulkarni chief executive officer great question although strongly believe generative ai vector search going materially increase overall addressable market size search long term also seeing ability differentiate compete better area observability security give sense play typically term security gone several elastic event thing consistently get everybody super excited audience talking security customer security ai assistant fact see realtime alert really interrogate system ask question deal alert ai assistant able help guide incredibly powerful reduces bar security analyst

best chance reducing hallucination something customer still making sure grow second pattern still lot internal facing staff eventually change right term driving taking customer look mentioned last three quarter every quarter adding several hundred customer incrementally using u using vector search use case storing dense vector vector similarity search talked adoption elser sparse encoding model excited traction seeing term customer adoption way driving effectively sale organization marketing event gone six elastic event fiscal year got six fourth quarter genai front center boot camp genai workshop box customer widely successful excited early momentum like said going take time build still early inning long haul believe going material increase tam usbrent thill jefferies analyst thank youoperatorthe next question come andrew sherman td cowen please go aheadandrew sherman td cowen analyst great thanks hey guy janesh annual cloud number seemed pretty strong stable mids growth really

legacy incumbent wanted make sure thinking properly help think using esql way start bringing maybe newly generated data drive new use case actually porting entire workload data estate previously locked legacy incumbent siem offeringsjanesh moorjani chief financial officer maybe start first question keep brief interest time term higher tier upsell generally seen pretty steady increase adoption higher tier time particularly enterprise seen several quarter expect continue drive growth elastic cloud looking ahead particular inflection expecting modeling consistent seeing quite time already routinely add additional feature higher subscription tier sale team demonstrate value customer part regular upsell motionash kulkarni chief executive officer let quickly touch upon esql esql bringing data incumbent always easy u incumbent query language allowed people interactive development using piped query semantics meant user switching elastic platform bit hurdle used thing certain way able
