ask please limit one question one followup question take moment compile roster first question come line arun jayaram jp morgan security please go ahead arun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst good morning doug wanted see could provide detail northern endurance think drove success project maybe detail scope perhaps technology fti providing term cc nature projectdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer thank good morning look stated prepared remark major milestone company also industry first application allelectric production system extremely extremely proud selected rigorous technical qualification required able considered receive award pleased came top qualification think everything shore seafloor call integrated carbon transportation system specific co tree part family developed configuration order co injection tree look simplified compared traditional oil gas tree actually technical particularly come sealing surface number cycle number time opening close would called cycle cycling valve co injection tree far far greater would typical oil gas development higher technical standard extremely pleased selected entire scope really interesting distance traversed kilometer nothing floating top water word taken subsea much like cc project brazil hisep project major major milestone really driving cc market enabling seafloor key component project arun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst great doug wanted see could maybe comment prepared remark talked new technology using unlock opportunity mature basin wondering maybe expand upon maybe comment see mature basin know one peer talked anticipating maybe improvement west africa starting next year maybe could elaborate doug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer sure would call traditional project likely driven forward mature basin given project economics integrated integrated approach call iepci along family help unlock economic value project specifically referring mature basin really two opportunity find different producing horizon case paleogene deeper horizon gulf mexico could step host facility technology key enablers get paleogene k full k production system fully qualified supported regulator well client major achievement noted third project first integrated k project awarded alluded script expect come future look stepouts mature basin enabled allelectric primary application traditional energy oil gas environment come allelectric production system enabling much greater distance three four time via using hydraulic control reach back existing host facility two key technology enablers case k allelectric case hisep talked first quarter advanced co separation subsea separation technology separating reinjecting seafloorarun jayaram jpmorgan chase company analyst great thanks lot dougoperatorour next question come line james west evercore isi please go aheadjames west evercore isi analyst hey good morning guysdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer good morning james youjames west evercore isi analyst right doug youdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer good thank youjames west evercore isi analyst actually saw result know well wanted start little bit bigger picture something talked bit past backlog epci contract coming feeling capacity starting really lever joint venture partnership add capacity make sure deliver back doug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer james timely question would expect see u utilize support within ecosystem able continue grow expand iepci market familiar terminology ecosystem made decision year ago would restructure way subsea industry operated integrated project also way would drive higher asset utilization drive cycle return standard higher past sustainable way would work well others personality company big monster work well people deep relationship trustbased put lot time effort allowed u go vessel operator introduce iepci concept iepci market continues grow become significant portion total project awarded today giving providing access partner work alongside u project deliver integrated project allows u expand beyond theoretical capacity installation portion project also manufacturing side project significant benefit think one fully understood see showing financial result ability able get leverage using subsea configure order run plant approximately double cadence onehalf time traditional rest industry building today get additional capacity either consolidation expanding capital budget building plant whereas invested technology technology system going engineering order configure order allows u additional cadence plant allowing u expand far beyond traditional theoretical capacity look monitor situation closely open share client longterm discussion well beyond time period would traditionally discussion confidence discussion u new operating model see understand thing allow u capacity continue expand deliver support projectsjames west evercore isi analyst ok got helpful doug thought firsttime award particularly carbon capture side fascinating could maybe expand use c cc contemplated initially targeted project additional offshore project targeting technology using kind existing technology new novel technology doug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer great question look working quite time james know kind look challenge sea floor think might company really take approach company quite frankly developer kind think onshore go offshore want sort fixed bottom like mono power something touching sea floor go offshore want sort floating structure fundamentally believe right way eliminate greenhouse footprint associated structure put everything seafloor take advanced technology material science automation control quite frankly place industry beyond industry academia etc really exists today proud operate putting thing one two mile deep water sea floor designed last year life advanced automation robotics control quite frankly challenge anything done industry beyond industry today look challenge like cc sure involved terrestrial project happy involved project fundamentally believe safest best place store co say line abandon depleted reservoir far offshore exist well known transport shore way injection field subsea without sort floating infrastructure demonstrated northern endurance partnership project described technology point view important note people believe reverse flow use existing oil gas infrastructure true much technical challenge would make one believe talked little bit tree tree design valve tree explained also come control automation also monitoring required project developed entire call integrated carbon transportation system allows u take basically host facility injection point would see definitely see trend cc also form energy new energy really reach fullest potential achieve scale required see going offshore certainly trend one helping enable proud sojames west evercore isi analyst got thanks dougoperatorour next question come line luke lemoine piper sandler please go aheadluke lemoine piper sandler analyst hey good morning doug recapped metric allelectric subsea already first announcement northern endurance ccsdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer luke dropped luke mind repeating question dropped lukeluke lemoine piper sandler analyst yes sure talking first allelectric system northern endurance cc kind look oil gas start seeing uptake allelectric speaking customer pinch point chatting themdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer sure thank luke look oil gas happening parallel cc opportunity see oil gas opportunity using electric full field development stress full field keep mind using electric actuation many year electric actuator installed subsea equipment around world part novel go fully electric system would include electric subsurface safety valve would unique partnership u working together halliburton enable allelectric subsea field development commercial activity going parallel see area also would stress though area oil gas see bigger opportunity tieback look allelectric tree expensive electrohydraulically operated tree right reason look tieback point view economics dissipate quickly longdistance tieback umbilical cost umbilical across long distance able use hydraulic actuation would either limiting would possible would costly look unit cost versus unit cost allelectric tree expensive therefore greenfield development think opportunity big market stress significant market area brownfield talked look around world floating production asset today fpsos fpsus producing nameplate capacity electric brownfield tieback allow able bring back near nameplate capacity without significant capital cost gotten cycle time brownfield project level slightly one year make economics compellingoperatorour next question come line guillaume delaby bernstein please go aheadguillaume delaby alliancebernstein analyst yes good morning doug maybe quick question regarding new capital allocation policy sure call way essentially resulting would say better financial outlook also kind underlying would say strategic thinking behind maybe elaborate little bit associated question maybe know time capital discipline still considering consider small targeted acquisition coming quarter thank youdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer let start second part guillaume thank question look continue small targeted acquisition case taking small investment early startup often cost capital using financial capital using human capital greatest currency company today subsea engineering unique company far significant experienced talented workforce often trade subsea engineering hour company trying tackle challenge go terrestrial developer offshore developer thing change quite bit knowledge particularly come dynamic design get detail major component also obviously putting thing onto sea floor going weigh first part comment want comment guillaume two major message alf delivered earlier one upgraded sp two targeting net zero term net debt two major milestone pas alf alf melin chief financial officer yes doug thank maybe build today gross debt billion net debt million previously stated operate company million cash doug said belief net debt neutral position u would imply would reduce debt little million reduced little bit million current billion level call intermediateterm target necessarily need immediately certainly debt going mature next two year take u naturally also emphasize given business outlook strong cash generation see ahead continue believe share repurchase remains one best us fund demonstrated distributing majority measurement solution proceeds first quarter also remain committed achieving investment grade doug said achieved upgrade investment grade sp march overall think longer term strategically maybe asking expected growth ebitda debt keep coming current level clearly expect onetime gross debttoebitda leverage ratio go forwardguillaume delaby alliancebernstein analyst ok useful hand thank alfoperatorour next question come line marc bianchi td cowen please go aheadmarc bianchi td cowen analyst hi thank wanted ask sort scope opportunity large project looking whiptail award yau earlier think expected billion inbound ended million billion suspect might going scope anticipated get materialize competitor could maybe address talk direct award sort scope getting right versus maybe opportunity could timedoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer thanks marc appreciate look important question mind need clarify appreciate giving u opportunity clarify subsea opportunity list publish every quarter published industry perspective think rig count trying demonstrate give people opportunity able see opportunity set exists within subsea industry therefore put expect anticipate tender project tendered client full scope reflected value award place value use purple blue red chart hopefully clarifies company happens tendering may may targeting full scope project many case important also understand subset opportunity list technipfmc full opportunity set competition technipfmc integrated company iepci integrated feed study ability enter exclusive proprietary integrated feed study upon completion assuming achieve economical hurdle rate project project receives fid project directly awarded company subsea opportunity list occasionally one might show wellknown project need put direct award proprietary u opportunity list second opportunity list look every day really drive performance company quite frankly performance inbound number often surprise upside give little bit idea really two list looking one world looking may tendering project way subsea opportunity list may think project contribute greatest value meaning integrated subsea whatever may may concerned something project may may tender well far scope think know comprehensive entire subsea project bring third party thirdparty key component talked ability able entire sps entire surf product installation capability make u position u uniquelymarc bianchi td cowen analyst ok thanks doug turn backoperatorour next question come line kurt hallead benchmark please go aheadkurt hallead benchmark company analyst hey good morning doug good morning everybody maybe quick followup respect mark question right recent past guy given outlook regarding would anticipate subsea order book look like course next couple year explicitly referenced call however given dynamic play talk quality quantity talk new technology unlocking new business opportunity wondering might able give u update order outlook changed changed alldoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer kurt much like marc thank clarifying best communicate effectively learn well fact mention target billion order three year remain confident achieving guidance approaching billion order u saying thought strong message confident let clear remain confident term feed activity term tendering activity term would say mature meaning latestage prefid conversation client today complaining marc busyoperatorour next question come line scott gruber citigroup please go aheadscott gruber citi analyst good morning one alf profitability business improving tax rate trend toward normalized level time guidance year think evolution tax rate could fall year aheadalf melin chief financial officer thanks question tax first maybe point look effective tax rate quarter little bit timing effect little bit lower normal quarter first stand behind guidance million million consider growth ebitda etc projecting would say implying roughly effective tax rate year current earnings mix planned talked little bit targeting normalized tax rate would continue build model looking year largely come combination earnings mix utilization tax opportunity could take advantage past overall remain confident drive toward normalized tax ratescott gruber citi analyst long think would take get something possible alf melin chief financial officer right ballpark somewhere two year yesscott gruber citi analyst ok thank youoperatorour next question come line doug becker capital one please go aheaddoug becker capital one security analyste thank doug previously mentioned allelectric subsea production system could result incremental tieback opportunity billion hoping could frame maybe realistic risk opportunity see today ftidoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer yes thanks doug yes number probably little stale actually point would say upside number term put think clearly allelectric adoption qualification allelectric pretty much covered entire client base take time obviously developing technology qualifying getting customer aligned hardset year year kind see developing yet might still little bit early obviously getting first award key cc environment brownfield tieback environment said thing bid parallel today cc traditional energy come look doug remain confident one honest one little bit nobrainer sitting existing host facility aging every day get additional hydrocarbon flow obviously improve financial result leverage cost capital investment may made many year ago make sense kind unique position lot infrastructure know world infrastructure sea floor unique position really try help kind marry somebody would called stranded asset simply meaning far away host facility able economically produced could support host facility capex required able marry somebody production asset certainly today conversation havingdoug becker capital one security analyste certainly sound encouraging reasonable expect allelectric award oil gas side year awarddoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer would like think thing month time frame little bit conservative could see something shorter end allelectric oil gas award project fid think could see customer fid think commercial discussion maturity discussion meant parallel meaning would far doug becker capital one security analyste got quick one alf free cash flow loss narrower least expected consensus expected context subsea toward upper half guidance range free cash flow trending toward upper half midpoint still best place anchoralf melin chief financial officer first free cash flow right strong first quarter u least net outflow represents really really represents solid start year u typically seasonally weak quarter also point million payment toward legal settlement affected quarter overall feel really good expect obviously build year typically trend year see majority cash flow generation second half year clearly grow ebitda particular subsea expect see little bit additional conversion free cash flow ebitda typically use ratio operationally sit today want use approximation ready officially take free cash flow always working capital dynamic thing lead end year look business profile fourth quarter still big quarter determine overall cash flow

development technology short answer yes yes squeeze followup time surface business saudi arabia aramco msc announcement mean given incremental spending going onshore unconventional gas offshore market compete mean seems like incremental positive particular mix middle eastdaniel thomson exane bnp paribas analyst confirm sort readiness respond incremental onshore demand surface equipment opportunity saudi compared expectation demand announcement aramco thanksdoug pferdehirt chairman chief executive officer sure daniel maybe clarify everyone saudi arabia business fall surface technology business think wellhead tree get wet ie go water surface fall surface business business saudi arabia primarily onshore business actually good reduction jackup market reduction offshore activity affect u typically produced production platform dry tree number well versus capex dollar spent versus number well drilled amount capex land latter obviously far greater perspective answering perspective selfishly shift land capex offshore capex favorable company think simple sell product allows well safely environmentally appropriately produced get paid wellbore matter addition gas important u revenue per unit sold higher gas oil shift gas favorable unconventional gas able provide additional product around fracturing stimulation side well expands let u say revenue per well market work u importantly following company decided make strategic investment kingdom bring manufacturing capacity asia kingdom continue ramp new facility gone successfully yet reached fullest potential anticipate
