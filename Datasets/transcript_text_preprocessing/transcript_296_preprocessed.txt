operator question answer operatoroperator instruction please stand compile qa roster first question come jonathan chang leerink partner line openjonathan chang leerink partner analyst hi guy thanks taking question first question help set expectation preliminary tamarack data coming asco second question discus rationale behind expanding tamarack study include patient nonsmall cell lung cancer small cell melanoma head neck anal cancer informing decision thank youscott koenig president chief executive officer thank much jonathan heard previously taken evaluation data published recently daiichi molecule esmo past fall data regard activity prostate cancer noted changed range seeing recall saw half patient mgkg q weekly dosing vobra duo expanded approximately patient cohort half patient reducing psa baseline given dosing right mgkg q mgkg q expectation safety improved expect actually delivering much mgkg q compared historical treatment mgkg q result expect psa similar range somewhere psa reduction regard overall response rate previously presented approximately quarter patient achieved confirmed unconfirmed response similar reported daiichi expectation greater regard rpfs primary endpoint study important one term obviously prolonging life quality life patient daiichi reported month rpfs said expect least six greater term rpfs going forward regard specific tumor type selected study expansion taking advantage experience treatment patient subset tumor well histology expression bh tumor type think promising tumor pursue also point expanding five different tumor also considering additional tumor future conduct studiesjonathan chang leerink partner analyst understood maybe clarifying question decision time expanding study include tumor type based internal data data seeing competitive landscape bothscott koenig president chief executive officer would say obviously given experience small cell instance daiichi hansoh seen nice activity small cell cancer opportunity test patient small cell cancer became obvious one include among five would say others based experience well preclinical work done target even limiting five also considering others would good opportunity looking value vobra duooperatorthank one moment next question next question come kelsey goodwin guggenheim line openkelsey goodwin guggenheim partner analyst hey guy thanks taking question first regarding asco abstract expect included safety preliminary efficacy data also abstract secondly could remind u patient enrollment tracked throughout think followup patient full asco presentation thank youscott koenig president chief executive officer thank much kelsey timing discus enrollment second became quite obvious pointed cutoff date january data submission early february asco result primarily relied safety data included abstract also noting plan present obviously clinical efficacy data able accumulate additional data closer time asco give sense decision made term presentation amendment original tamarack study began enroll patient end second quarter turn twothirds patient patient enrolled second half third quarter first half fourth quarter sufficient time allowed accumulate data regarding efficacy decision made primarily include safety data abstractkelsey goodwin guggenheim partner analyst perfect thank muchoperatorthank one moment next question next question come stephen willey stifel line openstephen willey stifel financial corp analyst yeah good afternoon thanks taking question maybe followup enrollment kinetics referenced scott guess speak characterize whether bolus patient came second half q first half q primarily across newly opened site across site treating investigator sufficient experience drugscott koenig president chief executive officer thanks question steve spoken initial site new amendment opened yous number site yous small greatest number site europe approval amendment european site later year created opportunity initiating enrollment large number site discussed rapidity enrollment far beyond expected fact ended probably hold exact number approximately third size intended enroll open never opened fast enrollment later year newly opened site yous site continue enroll proportion europe compared asia yous majority got enrolled europe bolus second half yearstephen willey stifel financial corp analyst ok clarify new site came online europe site already enrolled sufficient scott koenig president chief executive officer well remember regulatory timing getting amendment yous occurred yous started enroll patient majority came europe sheer number site therestephen willey stifel financial corp analyst ok understood guess kind baking mgkg mgkg qw dos mean know referenced mgkg safe say guy settled goforward dose point would need evaluate dosing regimen expand additional tumor typesscott koenig president chief executive officer think early final answer clearly want continue follow safety well ultimate activity alluded earlier remark expectation instance rpfs occur midyear think see totality data definitive one go forward pointed comment earlier data safety monitoring committee january looking safety time activity time available january concluded dos continue think decision arrive midyearstephen willey stifel financial corp analyst ok last question maturity rpfs statistic rate limiting ability initiate additional dose expansion cohortsscott koenig president chief executive officer slow working regulatory advantage operationalizing get going midyearoperatorthank one moment next question next question come etzer darout bmo capital market line openetzer darout bmo capital market analyst great thanks taking question couple thinking novel therapy vobra duo study maybe start describing thought around sort pivotal path development term novel therapy combination based observing tamarack far whether sort recent data set come prostate sort maybe change dynamic thinking pivotal development vobra duo thanksscott koenig president chief executive officer right thanks etzer comment activity tamarack study come asco obviously looking landscape necessary get high confidence regulatory approval think fortunate position patient dosed commented earlier sizable number patient chemotherapy experienced well chemotherapynaive study entered study idea phase study would likely done postchemo experience population changed view clearly chemonaive population efficacy safety warranted seems suitable population earlier line population pursue also pursue late line well still everything open point mature data make decisionetzer darout bmo capital market analyst great thank youoperatorthank one moment next question next question come yigal nochomovitz citigroup line openyigal nochomovitz citi analyst yeah hi scott thank clarify asco abstract seems like going focused safety presentation conference expect see initial radiographic pfs data notscott koenig president chief executive officer thank much yigal clearly show much efficacy data possible cutoff time likely going month month half submission ready presentation know meeting end may would presume require u material prepared midmay expectation would would cutoff date sort late march early april clearly lot data available patient dosed many month would include obviously psa reduction would look overall response rate full data set obviously full data set safety regard rpfs see many patient dosed long see least preliminary cut rpfs may require u wait next meeting early fall update certainly provide much data canyigal nochomovitz citi analyst ok thanks moment ago referenced rpfs least six month would expectation wondering comp familiar cartrial visiontrial cabazitaxel vobra duo respectively know slightly higher around eight eight half month reasonable expectation one expect tamarackscott koenig president chief executive officer yeah depend whether go chemonaive population chemo experience late line would study little broad look control study described obviously depend controlled drug typical one instance chemonaive population docetaxel around eight month similarly activity cart study eight month yes think population ultimately look would require six month would eight month higher certainly want limit drug could potentially achieve know answer yet pointing base minimum particularly later line population would least six monthsoperatorthank one moment next question next question come jon miller evercore line openjon miller evercore isi analyst hi guy thanks taking question would love ask additional indication moving vobra duo tamarack study additional data indication phase expansion seen point obviously seen lot interest indication bh broadly previously said prioritizing prostate bandwidth reason sort competitively white space talk u little bit changed decision chase indication coming secondly would love could go little bit deeper differentiation new mgc bh adc topo payload adc target developmentscott koenig president chief executive officer thanks much jon yes well know focusing prostate cancer bandwidth correct may recall two year ago intending expansion expansion melanoma cut back cash time clearly population strong interest also seen expansion study good activity indication thing like nonsmall cell lung cancer became great opportunity u activity head neck cancer well experience anal cancer vobra duo small cell obvious alluded based others experience initial reasoning behind going believe improved potential safety profile new dosing regimen patient cancer able stay drug longer potentially good outcome looking expand indication regard mgc pointed great opportunity u really take important answer important question great opportunity treating wide range cancer well aware different chemotherapy work different tumor combination chemotherapy well combination modality typical standard treatment cancer given wonderful experience variable domain vobra duo activity believe potentially superior topo inhibitor payload based synaffix profile pointed various vantage point including increased activity potency le susceptibility efflux multidrug resistance better sell permeability standard effect fact daiichi pointed many interstitial lung disease complication ascribing binding blm macrophage fact synaffix platform eliminates binding fc receptor well mannose receptor one potentially ability reduce ild effect topo inhibitor vantage point thing described earlier looking ability treat vobra duo looking potential combination mgc line looking treatment different tumor think provides u great opportunityjon miller evercore isi analyst thanks scott seen data various indication looking phase put holdscott koenig president chief executive officer yeah future date put data together publication yes future time data yet presentedoperatorthank one moment next question next question come kaveri pohlman btig line openkaveri pohlman btig analyst yeah good evening thanks taking question upcoming readout vobra duo data docetaxel naive experienced patient since going mature rpfs data second half thinking making decision go term phase trialscott koenig president chief executive officer well good question kaveri clearly metric looking beyond rpfs certain number patient advanced certainly would like full data set make final decision think midyear know quite well track moving forward phase point obviously want wait till last minute operationally lot least engagement regulatory agency describe plan get feedback would want aggressive possible least large body data available u midyearkaveri pohlman btig analyst right helpful second question regarding mgd color expect complete phase trial much time gilead make decision opt provide datascott koenig president chief executive officer regard mgd commenting middle dose escalation know tcell redirected killing mechanism bispecifics regulatory agency strict rate one dose escalation really limiting factor tell end many cohort group continuing quickly possible gilead short period time present full phase data opt program clearly still time clearly dose escalation decide want opt right sooperatorthank one moment next question next question come tara bancroft td cowen line opentara bancroft td cowen analyst hi good afternoon understand rationale potentially enabling broad development vobra duo inclusion pretaxane patient curious detail give u presentation baseline characteristic particular include time progression initial therapy depending answer followup thatscott koenig president chief executive officer clearly try provide detailed possible population know many patient data database term time progression go back look update future date know top head many patient datatara bancroft td cowen analyst ok thanks excluding rapid progressors right would expect affect rpfs like month versus month expectation come patientsscott koenig president chief executive officer think hit nail head trying give little bit broad brush stroke understanding patient rapid progressors allowed opened instance study original design study required least month treatment arac qualified enrollment study remove requirement clearly patient short course progressed quickly well newly diagnosed patient got initial treatment presented metastatic disease type patient could much aggressive course shorter course treatment gotten actually also feedback kols baseline six month unreasonable type patienttara bancroft td cowen analyst ok thank muchoperatorthank one moment next question next question come courtney kowalsky barclays line openpeter lawson barclays analyst hi peter lawson barclays couple question firstly abstract see safety broken discontinuation rate andor side effect hand infusion got followupscott koenig president chief executive officer peter discontinuation rate cut january data regard abstract recall specifically deep term breakdown aes get back thatpeter lawson barclays analyst thank tamarack study patient exposed radiopharmaceutical perjeta would able break eventuallyscott koenig president chief executive officer yeah unfortunately allowed study given timing study pointed majority patient came europe actual availability perjeta timing work get perjeta progressors experienced patient expect yous small number therepeter lawson barclays analyst ok quick question jim put take around around cash guidance expansion bh clinical trial kind guess negative cash put take kind thinking maintain cash guidancejim karrels senior vice president chief financial officer yeah thanks peter thanks question guidance cash runway reflects additional cohort tamarack umbrella additional vobra duo cohort everything talking study currently running talking running included part guidancepeter lawson barclays analyst gotcha additional inflow cash thinking kind counterbalance always cash guidancejim karrels senior vice president chief financial officer peter sorry could repeat question pleasepeter lawson barclays analyst additional cash inflow thinking cohort always cash guidancejim karrels senior vice president chief financial officer cohort new guidance saving always possibility additional business development activity course billion milestone hanging related tzield zynyz handicapped significantly would anticipate recognition next couple yearsscott koenig president chief executive officer additional revenue coming anticipated originally part guidancepeter lawson barclays analyst great ok thank much thanks clarityoperatorthank one moment next question next question come silvan tuerkcan citizen jmp line opensilvan tuerkcan jmp security analyst yeah thank thanks taking question congrats progress maybe piggybacking little bit previous question bar safety profile abstract also asco presentation versus safety profile seen older dos asking particular maybe grade higher issue seen foot map signal perhaps neutropenia comment trying improve bar make confident future followupscott koenig president chief executive officer sure silvan want correct concern grade hand foot obviously want avoid though incidence quite low issue patient would either grade experiencing pain would electing come treatment despite fact antitumor effect number one important decrease incidence totally reduced incident converting preventing going grade grade would goal regard neutropenia clearly something likely due free toxin getting bone marrow situation largely laboratory value result increased infection federal neutropenia mostly handled holding drug stopping drug reduce term incident grade think better concerning treating physician managing patientssilvan tuerkcan jmp security analyst great thank maybe lorikeet study get data study year maybe relates latestage monotherapy plan get data combo vobra duo lorigerlimabscott koenig president chief executive officer regard timing provide said earlier update study ultimately depend speed enroll patient clearly next two month exceed plan take longer meaning later year get full enrollment study latter likely fulsome update early able give little bit guidance later year based enrollment rate regard success trial clearly testing chemonaive population combination docetaxel think trial successful great problem vobra duo pan also line therapy also say eliminating possibility going look lorikeet lorigerlimab laterline prostate cancer certainly possibility consider said also going look lorigerlimab outside prostate cancer going forward early make decision registration study datasilvan tuerkcan jmp security analyst great thank youoperatorthank operator instruction next question come yigal nochomovitz citigroup line openyigal nochomovitz citi analyst hi thank much taking followup scott quick followup tamarack unusual see trial enrolled relative target enrolled quickly could comment factor resulted heavy overenrollment well speed overenrolled thanksscott koenig president chief executive officer yeah yigal regard decision letting many patient study felt ethical u allow patient study already screening passed screening requirement felt patient made investigator made great effort find patient study commenting earlier surge enrollment goahead amended protocol europe tremendous enthusiasm join study sure lot different reason pointing amendment included fact require month treatment arac patient progressing quickly able join study probably much term alternative also turn large number patient varying reason whether qualified go docetaxel chemotherapeutic
