fattolean muscle loss ratio whereas semas step trial showed ratio albeit slightly different assessment thank youjoe fletcher senior vice president investor relation thanks david ask dan fill thatdan skovronsky chief scientific officer president lilly immunology yeah thanks question maybe starting take lean versus fat mass think ratio lean fat mass important thing think body composition body weight matter patient example risk type diabetes cardiovascular disease body ratio seems important good news patient tirzepatide ratio appears improve pointed lose far fat mass lean mass every trial done end trial measure body composition better higher ratio lean fat beginning trial see changing body composition benefit potential benefit tirzepatide explored course also benefit want extend seen u try improve total amount body weight loss also trying improve improve say change body mass composition saw u acquire versanis experiment drug like bimagrumab number quote tirzepatide semaglutide study seem right course headtohead study raise question whether potential benefit gip gip agonism addition glp agonism probably way would interpret datajoe fletcher senior vice president investor relation

positive would best u conclude tirzepatide nash thank youjoe fletcher senior vice president investor relation thank stevedan skovronsky chief scientific officer president lilly immunology yeah thanks steve clever analysis first say literally got phase data give u chance determine next step plan probably would debunk least one hypothesis nothing bad data would stop u going phase term better molecule probably retatrutide course kind phase data retatrutide based liver fat reduction incredible phase trial still though think positive phase trial really meaningful data nash obligates u think next step said going fda talk would say term planning phase drug nash really important priority u move away much liver biopsy replace noninvasive testing think others field made lot progress see analogy disease area hope future possible conduct phase nash trial without relying biopsy would really profound effect feasibility running trial quickly also clinical application nash drug noninvasive

thanks taking question ask thought gip agonism versus antagonism given data yesterday competitor suggesting limited effect thing like blood pressure lipid modification differentiated think agonism approach versus antagonism think agonism way forward thank youjoe fletcher senior vice president investor relation dandan skovronsky chief scientific officer president lilly immunology yeah well first fair comparison much data benefit gip agonism ten thousand participant randomized clinical trial tirzepatide extremely confident benefit gip agonism adding data experimented pure gip agonist glp reported benefit phase study contrasting small phase study recently published drug glp agonism gip antagonism noted publication gip antagonism much lower affinity probably start antagonize gip high dos probably question company noted high dos actually increase free fatty acid complete attenuation decrease triglyceride clinical trial effect attribute gip surprised antagonism gip starting negative effect kick also see gip agonism positive benefit tolerability reducing potentially nausea vomiting think maybe higher dos could probably see hint opposite effect antagonism pretty glad decision took
