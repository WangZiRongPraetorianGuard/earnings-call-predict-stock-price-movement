first question come line anita soni cibc world market line openanita soni cibc world market analyst hi good morning patrick team thanks taking question last week hosted comprehensive threeyear outlook thank lot question think would asked call answered guess looking report q cost came would calibrate cost going forward really look largely line expectation new afton cost came q trying understand going come course next three yearsi know lot moving part mining different zone could give u sort know directional qualitative well quantitative indication production sorry mining processing cost new aftonyohann bouchard executive vice president chief operating officer anita yohann thanks question want say mean basically unit cost per tonne basis pretty much nothing changed mostly relative grade tonne pushed mill q go would say well go well since based mining extraction sequence going see kind lower grade going offset higher throughput year would say think put comment aspect overall would say way would calibrate model lower grade higher throughput think well written presentation answer question going forward longerterm cost know going commission crusher conveyor circuit end year based going see drastic decrease operating cost expecting basically cash cost operating cost go significantly overall assume going ramp tonne tonne process impact going massive hopefully answered questionanita soni cibc world market analyst yes guess would get processing side back half ramp throughput perhaps processing cost come dramatic decrease commission crusher conveyor inaudibleyohann bouchard executive vice president chief operating officer correct anitapat godin president chief executive officerc also anita still softening capital construction draw bell draw point construction completed end mostly extraction going forward deplete mainly opexanita soni cibc world market analyst ok another question guess one grade drilling little bit copper grade seems little like grade guided seems little low like throw tonnage recovery grade provided would low end copper guidance range something sort holding back little bit term grade like positive grade reconciliation potential better recovery rate little conservative side fair sayyohann bouchard executive vice president chief operating officer think anita way think block cave mining sequence really dictated basically shape cave mean change grade feel model need adjusted low grade see shorter period time really due extraction sequence expect experience additional dilution moment get model would say compare would say
