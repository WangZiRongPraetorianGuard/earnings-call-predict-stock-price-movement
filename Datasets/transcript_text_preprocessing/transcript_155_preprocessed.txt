offset amount also approximately million million result occupancy new campus site including depreciation main driver cost increase opex increase operatorour next question come joshua buchalter td cowen company please proceed questionjoshua buchalter td cowen analyst hey guy thank taking question first one detail provide advanced engagement particular incremental three added quarter whether geographic mix drivetrain perhaps importantly update timeline conversion advanced engagement thank youamnon shashua founder chief executive officer take general making steady progress activity mentioned increase come mix geography european american also asia progress making three front commercial front technical front also legal firm order make sure aspect related agreement addressed continue expect make get convergence within second half year want maybe refer volkswagen partnership took u year year half conclude see shorter time frame existing engagement still think second half year good point time start see conversion therejoshua buchalter td cowen analyst thank followup wanted ask eyeql obviously good initial design win metric maybe spend minute two talking feature customer use l also able guess extract incremental asp part assume mentioned asp change much guess bit surprised given moving nanometer nanometer chip allow good amount performance uplift would curious hear detail engagement core ada eyeql begin meaningful part mix time thank youamnon shashua founder chief executive officer ok asp driven functional bundle process node chip bundle increasing due regulatory expansion also incorporating expansion many program also program win also include cloud enhanced right program q similar asp existing generation see drive toward higher bundle would increase asp big asp jump come advanced product portfolio supervision chauffeur drive asp increase base really incremental one followup operatorour next question go aheadamnon shashua founder chief executive officer sorry make one followup reinforce kind historically generation goal really provide incremental feature allow oems meet regulatory cap requirement without changing price really kind strategy time obviously higher performance give potential increased bundle drive higher asp general trying kind keep pricing keep cost successive generation provide incremental featuresoperatorour next question come shreyas patil wolfe research please proceed questionshreyas patil wolfe research analyst hey thanks much taking question maybe firstly think supervision profitability think indicating low gross margin second quarter believe longterm target closer think progression toward longterm target next quarter even beyondamnon shashua founder chief executive officer track increasing gross margin secondgeneration domain controller production road month completely replace generation one domain controller increase gross margin considerably future product iq also designed gross margin approaching target convergingshreyas patil wolfe research analyst ok maybe bit longerterm question curious think trend see market like china example automaker seemingly willing invest deploy quite expensive system kind data trying develop software inhouse know talked challenge automaker term scaling outside china see guess curious see risk inside china automaker willing pursue approach albeit expensive cost supervision deliver see potentially automaker region working internal system well similar way thanksamnon shashua founder chief executive officer view also historically competition good creates demand highend solution inhouse development china exists work handinhand oems car model inhouse development car model mobilized equipped automotive see eyeson system eyeson system win end day cost versus performance one pay higher cost performance mobileyes supervision system cost competing system system three ada supervision without ada necessarily ada supervision system look sympotically eyeson system cost need move performance first performance cost great advantage another advantage china rapid expansion rem allows enable handsfree driving also urban setting going launch think next month next six week first urban drive shanghai going deployed vehicle currently road going really industryleading experience expand throughout china quite quickly something outsourced technology difficult scale high definition map across urban area come next generation eyeoff none competitor concrete plan get eye system mobileye company supplier eyesoff production program one multiple production program especially leading company like audi also generates volume credibility think putting everything together kind competition see china risk see advantage put pressure oems also outside china deploy kind advanced system inhouse development outside china see declining considerably many oems made announcement inhouse development taken step back starting serious adopting supervision forthdan galves chief communication officer may follow think important u dynamic china evidence oems seek differentiation autonomy kind important aspect invest ensure competitive product oems lean toward inhouse development expensive system investing significant capital still say believe autonomy key differentiator future recently supported also statement tesla made earnings call earlier week going kind next big thing oems seek kind escape price challenge today kind ruling world china see important development solidifies longterm perspective oems expect lead toward competitive product short time market competitive cost bestinclass performance need compete within next couple year believe product best suit need point time stand behind increase amount engagement last quartershreyas patil wolfe research analyst thanksoperatorour next question come tom narayan rbc please proceed questiontom narayan rbc capital market analyst yes thanks taking question first one kind high level mentioned tesla announcement week recent week seems pivot toward robotaxi front certainly fsd big driver vision guess question seems like talking reluctance engage level plus reason movement toward potentially level proof concept consumer see level believe see robotaxis road maybe halo effect autonomy general guess question think agree maybe robotaxi level side thing far distant thing maybe pulled forward little bit proof concept could potentially catalyst level plus view two thing completely separate animalsamnon shashua founder chief executive officer well fsd level plus call fsd supervised level plus tesla accelerating robotaxi plant also robotaxi production volkswagen id buzz coming uplift demand robotaxi also uplift u whether could introduce robotaxi using camera kind skeptical know going introduce say robotaxi additional active sensor camera believe eyesoff system rather calling robotaxi let u call eyesoff system eye mean drive autonomously selected type road necessarily every type road still great value eyesoff system show product line great value proposition also believe time even overtake level plus term volume see something next decade term volume ramp supervision decade eyesoff would term scaling overtaking level plus see something next decade happy proven wrong acceleratedtom narayan rbc capital market analyst ok quick followup oems talking obviously five already three new one obviously supervision regular supervision obviously kind light version supervision curious oems talking outside one already majority regular kind supervision different kind variety kind supervision light product think distributionamnon shashua founder chief executive officer well first answer mix supervision safer supervision light kind balanced mix would say see oems trying build vehicle line vehicle line full supervision also maybe bulk volume instead front camera supervision light type system five camera five radar six camera five radar still offer advanced function compared base data today improve competitiveness lowcost car offer new supervision consumer controllable cost kind life like parallel supervision chauffeur car light see engagement oems u really kind change way looking base ada future actually think potentially diverge two stream one continue lowend frontcamera meet lowest cost possible regulation addition see growing demand supervision light next generation base data segment let u say kind extension life coexists next supervision looking yeah clarify engagement vast majority engagement including discussion around multiple product right like volkswagen group definetom narayan rbc capital market analyst got thanksoperatorour next question come dan levy barclays please proceed questiondan levy barclays analyst hi good morning thank taking question wanted start question volkswagen publicly known maybe could give u little parameter program software versus hardware component homicide actually using domain controller extent functionality going enabled regional split release think commentary point vw would eventually use inhouse solution maybe could comment guess stickiness agreement maybe bridge solution thatamnon shashua founder chief executive officer term parameter deal volkswagen group mobileye position tier supplier responsible end end hardware tier supplier working u example parking system full tier supplier expect u full tier supplier many additional program program full tier supplier responsible progress end end includes perception term software perception driving policy control dxp component finetune customize driving experience brand term comment point moving inhouse development think table many many year software division called cariad software division still operation full force point maybe able deliver kind system deliver believe stickiness system strong validation required reach high level performance supervision enormous stabilization required eyesoff beyond anything industry experienced far believe stickiness strong nimrod nehushtan executive vice president strategy business development yes may add little bit color first partnership announced includes supervision chauffeur drive amnon mentioned going deployed overall car model includes brand volkswagen group premium brand audi porsche bentley lamborghini maybe sharpen stickiness aspect partnership address existing architecture nextgeneration architecture volkswagen plan launch onwards kind plan deploy specific car model allocated today product many year come started production inhouse activity still exists today future architecture maybe point time mature includes many thing working replace product case mature live different architecture different car part future case materialize term stickiness reach production many many car deployed many year year productiondan levy barclays analyst great thank followup wanted go china commentary think time ago noted zeekr offering free month trial highway supervision know could provide feedback way get sense take rate going future functionality something confidence could fairly high take rate maybe standard fit throughout zeekr lineup vehiclesamnon shashua founder chief executive officer discussion zeekr make really standard fit rather takerate type functionality rising competition china believe convergence standard fitdan levy barclays analyst thank youoperatorour next question come samik chatterjee jp morgan please proceed questionjoe cardoso jpmorgan chase company analyst hi thanks question joe cardoso samik maybe followup oem engagement guy shown good progress moving three oems production covering versus year ago curious think headroom left go like would characterize view relative let u call ceiling change relative six nine month ago even year ago given development ecosystem approaching production least kind engagement already peripheral thank younimrod nehushtan executive vice president strategy business development yes think flywheel effect seeing engagement oems announced partnership oems build credibility advanced product line also prepared today let u say term business development activity supporting engagement parallel capacity support capacity support even happened last year multiple factor amnon laid beginning number one competition china also outside china moving toward handsoff next differentiator car number two build credibility announcement kind help u reinforce position leader front think know today need done order secure engagement yearlong negotiation one biggest car company world think stand behind increase also kind adoption curve today interesting dan mentioned working kind early majority middle pack back oem innovator market today engagement kind show u time frame handoff product become available term amount oems launch themjoe cardoso jpmorgan chase company analyst maybe quick followup one second question rather wanted touch destocking situation sound like made great progress talk maybe change process put place improve visibility around inventory customer tracking working today thanks questionmoran shemesh chief financial officer yes think actually discussed last call situation experienced put process place year say q actually based global production actual production ada fitment rate production per oem actually analyzed gap actually shipped q would expect ship inventory issue give u kind comfort also looked course yearoveryear growth see make sense exercise full year full year taking expected lower volume look pretty good increasing top customer looking q q outcome get compared customer order indication q q get approximately similar number encouraging aspect stepdown analysis versus indication term receiving data visibility customer get verification indication something full visibility process place top verify data received actually comparison two make sure aligned escalationoperatorour next question come ananda baruah loop capital market please proceed questionananda baruah loop capital market analyst hey guy thanks taking question two quick clarification could first guy commented expecting mix normalize second half year guess clarification back midsingledigit supervision look something different sort given supervision ramp quick clarification followup well thanksamnon shashua founder chief executive officer think issue inventory related supervision related eyeq supervision track quarter volume shipped expectation believe number first half year would follow guidance full guidance year remaining second half according guidance gave beginning yearananda baruah loop capital market analyst second clarification around asp heard may hearing said hearing completely heard one hand asp thought also heard another comment asp year year moran shemesh chief financial officer yes versus take account mix supervision eyeq supervision course higher asp also – vendor hardware asp significantly higher overall asp mainly driven mix supervision revenue percentage total revenue much higher segment eyeq asp comment eyeq asp – yes eyeq asp lower q specifically believe asp represents normal asp year q shipped million chip mix obviously changed example lowcost program china became higher percentage million chip asp lower volatile quarter deliver million chip expect increase q q asp eyeq € € total year yes expect eyeq asp go approximately year year continuing normalization mix compared rich level modest impact expect similar impact full yearananda baruah loop capital market

skeptical whether oem customer would softwaredefined internal combustion vehicle guess question would actually well theoretically practically possible would expect based visibility today see supervision fitment production internal combustion architecture vehicleamnon shashua founder chief executive officer target group win model nine combustion engine model model going combustion engine softwaredefined vehicle system like ada system really encapsulated ecu softwaredefined vehicle air update done ecu everything selfcontainedmoran shemesh chief financial officer may follow think maybe year ago oems said future plan term future architecture softwaredefined vehicle based ev assumption ev become leading powertrain car toward back half decade changed oems last year plan today maybe little bit moderate term ev percentage versus combustion engine hybrid still mean kind aligning architecture powertrain balanced way opposed going allin ev future technologiesdan galves chief
