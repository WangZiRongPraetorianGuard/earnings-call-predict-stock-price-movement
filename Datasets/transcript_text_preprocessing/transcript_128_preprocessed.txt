start year slide sort minimum capital think line look like billion hiking kind stay capex go would mean capacity potential longer term caseneal sheorey chief financial officer yes think commented earlier would look billion kind maintenance capital u around maintain asset continue operate could price stay could get kind run rate end number speak would little bit higher get run rate would impact longterm growth went level current planning project executing moment get u kind growth rate cut back level would impact materially beyond thatmike sison well fargo security analyst followup ebitda margin storage pretty good know think need need higher pricing industry mean price think lithium need support growth expected end decade maybe thought think others around world margin pretty good good used think still pretty good margineric norris president lithium right going comment people margin stay operate ish type margin rate get noise pl kind transition big price spodumene cost run rate could get around still grow business u think good margin talking stronger margin would stronger price move issue price really return new investment project existing business pl margin deliver price need move order develop new project get growth industry need support ev transition going comment different every project every geography price need need believe year order get return project go fid say number one probably would say different geography region technology resource look like quite different way pick one particular numberoperatorour next question joshua spector ubs line open please go aheadchris perrella ubs analyst hi good morning everyone chris perrella josh wanted follow neal q energy storage ebitda margin guided given put take higher cost spodumene inventory maybe million drag second quarter also oneoff talison bridge together get q margin step absence talison oneoff second half yearneal sheorey chief financial officer yes think let u talk second quarter first basically way think think number probably right kind range math based first quarter said prepared remark expect point bump energy storage ebitda margin second quarter probably get range million bump ebitda q versus q really driven primarily expectation partner taking allotment talison plus additional ton getting offtake second quarter well basically serf basis percentage point bump term going forward sort onetime bump expect third fourth quarter come back pretty healthy margin healthy second quarter expect plant continue ramp continue absorb fixed cost continue get margin expansion versus first quarter sure third fourth quarter exit yearchris perrella ubs analyst perfect quick followup sequentially second quarter expect volume trying bridge seasonality get kt full yearneal sheorey chief financial officer yes volume least sequentially asking yes higher volume get q versus q remember peak energy storage demand usually third quarter building peak highest quarter year yes would

need tangible way go balance year next yearneal sheorey chief financial officer yes start eric fill gap think mean biggest thing u moment primary product around hydroxide carbonate balancing lfp become prevalent got stronger demand carbonate stronger larger percentage portfolio carbonate historically building hydroxide balancing two understanding chemistry go long term going solid state shift much carbonated hydroxide lithium metal longerterm scenario carbonate hydroxide playing asset building noweric norris president lithium yes colin little would color around would say still see market hydroxide high nickel favored outside china versus carbonate supporting lfp big part china market innovation coming largely china lfp chemistry higher energy density efficiency well cost profile
