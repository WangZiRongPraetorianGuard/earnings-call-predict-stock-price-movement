year year end car represents total ifp expect roughly maintain share begin expand significantly beyond put differently car going losing share really carrying weight maintaining share growing share thereafter term aggressively plan expand let say following first right course loss ratio car come target range seeing opportunity invest much aggressively growing book process begun step really hit stride say begun fact car actually grew significantly place profitability attractive true largest market like california new jersey outside state book relatively small grew growth rate opportunity present grow pretty aggressively foray growing car given u data experience confidence time adjust rate place increasing growth investment expecting car account newly written premium year still breakout expect car deliver due course engine finally tuned revved definitely gearing toward year several exciting technology advancement help crossselling even refinement telemetry data science behind released really enable u accelerate growth car growth given case currently project share newly written car premium next year probably double year hope address question next one come darren darren asks asked two question kind related going bundle together firstly say q lemonade mentioned generative ai meaningfully improving cost structure expected course month month month financial benefit realized evidence generative ai help also asked could elaborate much ifp customer current headcount could support particularly billion billion ifp much larger would employee base need darren really great question exactly kind thing preoccupy u focus let start giving kind rearview mirror achieved far delivered significant operating leverage recent year last year headcount grown compounded annual growth ifp grown cagr time see dramatic divergence headcount expense payroll expense top line think speaks volume financial benefit realized continue realize fact payroll expense year year even though business grew think strong indicator looking giving little bit context color think scalability employee base tend think split roughly half employee think variable cost customerfacing team customer support claim would typically expect grow le line customer growth twice many customer usually mean twice many customer support query twice many claim would naturally else equal grow le linear fashion everything else engineering finance legal etc would expectation really outstanding historical operating leverage mentioned really delivered everimproving pretty dramatic improvement automation rate placing significant downward pressure growth variable headcount plus lot smart expense management targeted automation initiative keep rest organization le stable size marketing team using generative ai coding team using generative ai etc two month ago referenced fact brandnew generative ai tool handling incoming customer service email clear distinct roughly third inapp interaction maya handle unaided email much harder usually come without context necessarily know customer talking policy unlike app context already harder nut crack rate happy report one quarter later pretty much tripled roughly seeing notable acceleration see trajectory think done far really early inning tip iceberg whatever metaphor want see reason ultimately automate overwhelming majority customer interaction deliver today least level customer satisfaction generate human interaction seeing similar level net promoter score csat indicator shifting look forward kind far go well term fixed team like referring engineering financing marketing others think massively scalable think got strong team wellstaffed conceptually could double triple perhaps even x business without seeing significant growth team choose launch new market new product may introduce bit headcount think even said broadly true pretty much staffed level see needing department foreseeable future term variable expect grow team grow given massive automation drive generative ai tool think divergence continue top line grow significantly faster growth team fraction book growth rate really scalability financial result come summary kind anecdote said statistic historical success indicator operating leverage much focus continue sustained scalability team key driver focusing business ultimately deliver ebitda breakeven point speaking continue grow denominator holding numerator close steady possible really key think exactly ok next question come darren paper bag pretty much question asked thing going chewy talking result detail something comfortable far cautious disclosing partner result made number public also going circumspect say thrilled nationwide launch collaboration company much expanded reach remain bullish ability continue leverage platform also say result far broadly aligned modeling partner chewy done without getting specific pretty much line broad stroke planned beyond quantity also share quality book good really par book term premium term retention loss rate bundle rate etc reinforces aspiration partnership going forward finally paper bag got duopoly questioner today paper bag asks following q noncar sale crosssells upsells illinois car reached current crosssell upsell rate car without also investor day yous customer multiline current percentage ok great focused question let try address happy report metric referenced since number gave question improved course past year noncar sale cross sale product combined quarter sale came existing customer include car get closer nationwide basis even though car available many state nationwide basis told today customer one product fifth number quoted investor day important note illinois continued see good progress talk illinois first state product available great kind indicator might go nationwide basis rate illinois customer customer u couple year two year almost one product twice average elsewhere take time u grow multiline customer across entire book might indicator might go course next couple year place product need allow book mature need continue expand product availability nationwide give indication near term year focus growth pet renter car homeowner mentioned car percentage earlier question excuse see customer growth come mainly pet renter rather product huge boon number asking term multiline customer car get profitability different state lean indicated probably later year next year would expect also pretty significant effect multiline customer number beyond hand call back operator take
