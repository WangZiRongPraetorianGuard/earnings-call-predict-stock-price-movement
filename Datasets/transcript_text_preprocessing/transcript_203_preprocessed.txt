expectation nearterm spread set volatility yearpeter federico director president chief executive officer sure chris tried address extent prepared remark think chris referenced fact quarter looked lot different previous quarter similar move really critical point perspective occurred first quarter generally stable market condition significant repricing timing magnitude shortterm rate move fed importantly shift yet become shift paradigm respect monetary policy said another way fed really clear number communication policy rate likely peak next move likely going ease first quarter simply plateauing cpi data came show improvement fed looking two three day following cpi report year treasury moved basis point stance taking one started year market probably incorrectly may optimistic expected fed ease five six time sit today market repriced one half move year importantly aggregate fed fund future tell u six move total meaning fed fund rate according market projection going settle around materially higher fed longrun target still occur significant repricing path shortterm interest rate paradigm shift inflation continues evolve reaccelerate could shift monetary policy believe going happen get important inflation data end week pce report believe think fed still belief inflation show sign improvement move toward fed longrun target way fed estimate pc end year going materially number come end week projection fed expected remove think year call seems like pretty healthy place year context fed fund target ultimately going move think inflation report ultimately come favor direction fed one think repricing simply healthy movement shortterm rate cut going occur magnitude paradigm shift spread moved lot geopolitical risk volatility following inflation report get two three inflation report better expected sort significant repricing opposite direction think fed looking two three month row better data sufficient confidence get data everybody pricing eas direction monetary policy clear right little uncertain think repricing largely respect spread asked look current coupon spread near middle range seems like good place perspective current coupon five year treasury basis point seems like healthy place swap seems like healthy place negative seasonal right next april may kind worst seasonal month mortgage term origination market sort think good place right repricing taken placeterry barclays analyst got thank helpful color hedge ratio duration gap guy took hedge ratio running slightly positive duration gap maybe little bit color move talk comfortable running book environmentpeter federico director president chief executive officer sure talked make sense u gradually move hedge ratio fed monetary policy outlook change obviously wanted run high hedge ratio shortterm debt essentially termed order protect funding cost rising shortterm rate environment inflection point time would expect come get confidence magnitude fed cut ultimately probably operate even lower hedge ratio point monetary policy easing process would want operate sense percent shortterm debt unhedged bigger part funding mix time chris mentioned let speak mentioned gradual movement toward swap hedge mix think sort positive outlook chris want talk little bit thatchris kuehl executive vice president chief investment officer yeah funding obviously sulfur based logically want generally significant portion hedge sulfurbased swap also better carry last couple year bid mortgage highly correlated treasury given dominant investor base index fund opposed bank made sense sizable component hedge book treasury based hedge yous treasury issuance also extraordinarily high time bank position grow security holding effect cheapening treasury versus swap bank deposit stabilizing qt likely drawing end gradually moving hedge book higher concentration swapbased hedge gradual shift want maintain diversification within hedge portfolio composition asset sideterry

leverage little higher today actually around given backup net asset value portfolio activity date anything particular today marketchris kuehl executive vice president chief investment officer yes respect material change size portfolio quarter date respect relative value within agency space mentioned earlier higher coupon significantly outperformed lower coupon quarter part given concern around bank sale lower coupon related balance sheet restructuring announcement made also response favorable prepayment report showed considerably flatter refi response higher coupon compared saw last refi wave covid similar incentive refinance coupon benefited well despite higher coupon outperforming would say relative value still generally upward sloping across coupon stackmerrill ross compass point research trading analyst ok one unrelated question mindpeter federico director president chief executive officer suremerrill ross compass point research trading analyst series c callable would use liquidity mean maybe margin really material curiouspeter federico director president chief executive officer appreciate question constantly evaluating capital structure right series callable mentioned

thank youpeter federico director president chief executive officer sure appreciate questionoperatorand last question come line eric hagen btig please go aheadjake katsikas btig analyst good morning actually jake katsikas eric appreciate guy taking question first one could flesh little bit outlook prepayment speed including much room might see forecast change mortgage rate kind coming recently think faster speed would benefit maybe headwind earnings possible economic return thankspeter federico director president chief executive officer sure chris want talk prepaymentchris kuehl executive vice president chief investment officer given coupon composition slower speed prepay report last two month interesting report last couple year spending december sort december midfebruary timeframe sort local low mortgage rate rate around spending second quarter third quarter last year originating pool note rate got lot insight refi response going look like sizable population loan call basis point basis point incentive refinance learned speed quite bit slower many feared slower observed covid loan similar incentive refinance mentioned provided tailwind higher coupon interesting think number factor likely contributed slower response saw last refi wave slower speed favorable position respect lowest coupon small percentage holding even would say turnover speed last year little better little faster many feared hopefully give insight outlook speedsjake katsikas btig analyst yes appreciate finally going back leverage historical range leverage think range might change mortgage spread remain historically widepeter federico director president chief executive officer yes mean look look back long history put number leverage ranged probably low point maybe around thereabouts highest
