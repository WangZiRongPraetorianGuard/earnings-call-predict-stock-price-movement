chief financial officer yeah hi one main driver relatively lower guidance year assumption spread gas transportation contract last year captured several gas transportation capacity optimization opportunity example cold weather event occurred west coast first quarter obviously predict event guidance assumes compressed gas transportation spread market present wellpositioned capture opportunity one main factor one al hosn assumed lower sulfur pricing compared last year sulfur price nearterm low around per ton primarily due weak asian fertilizer demand also sale builtup sulfur inventory major regional producer based market trend think see potential improvement price second half demand pickup also unwinding sulfur inventory last thing would say think sort low point term midstream income assumed narrow spread gas transportation year starting next year also going start getting benefit two transportation contract expiring like mentioned prepared remark looking forward next three year four year see significant uplift midstream incomejohn royall jpmorgan chase company analyst great thanks color sunil maybe hoping little bit detail million boe addition reserve pretty big number

essentially revision productivity improvement area bulk permian eor think richard look reserve replacement ratio onshore pretty significantrichard jackson president operation yous onshore resource carbon management yeah mean add mean obviously focus nearterm highlight putting primary bench developing driving outperformance production highlight trying put call secondary bench becoming prevalent program look highlight second bone spring bone spring line look delaware chart got cumu production highlighting yearonyear performance delaware secondary bench outperforming average delineate develop really driving reserve unconventional eor continues well talk detail interest project going increase capacity gas processing facility like seminole think highlighted also giving u nearterm call operability really reliability production incremental investment year driving say couple thousand barrel day improved base production also providing capacity develop low development cost barrel vicki noted able bring co future sort thinking reserve story play nearterm outperformance longterm picking reserve wellvicki hollub president chief executive officer would add place add significant reserve

build get co atmosphere going sustainable barrel world going resource world need get leave oil conventional reservoir oil reservoir acceptable united state continue energy independence eor going part equation ultimately getting way ahead game sure ready believe climate transition would affordable world without eor able produce net zero carbon barrel oil huge part strategy important shareholder love value yous ultimately part world nearer term forecast richard data thatrichard jackson president operation yous onshore resource carbon management yeah perfect tie mean one attribute really like around eor production talk lot lower decline came last several year especially downturn lower commodity price able flat flatter decline le able help u maintain lot free cash flow really started restoration development last year year go forward well bring online add barrel day new well production benefit eor talk midcycle double next year triple third year really hit peak production around barrel day based investment today three year thing mentioned shortly provide little color seminole gas plant expansion million day add term capacity million year expect couple thousand barrel day add base production think kind cash investment intensity capital intensity competitive got portfolio vickis point able bring co anthropogenic co future good return project competitive portfolio especially given lower decline look seminole look another barrel day barrel day type opportunity minimal capital within sort range capital spending year eor building sort wedge great opportunity bring co

gas segment trying trying balance margin base decline capital flexibility start cash margin start yous unconventional high margin high return based everything heard far getting better year gulf mexico one highest cash margin portfolio look incremental basis even higher large part operating cost fixed international asset mostly production scheduling conflict get higher share production lower price help mitigate commodity price risk protect overall cash margin margin point view think base decline today production approximately production unconventional crownrock going get around trying balance shortcycle highend decline conventional midcycle shallower decline conventional investment permian eor like richard said one lowest base decline portfolio look typical permian eor project get peak production third year peak production almost three time first year production shallow decline help manage overall corporate decline help sustaining capital ultimately help breakeven third part capital flexibility look capex even year around upstream capex yous onshore flexibility change activity depending macro condition like look back yous onshore around rig planned operate year able wrap quickly efficiently macro demand three attribute look look oil gas capital allocation summarize would say diverse portfolio conventional unconventional asset help manage base decline also maximizing return
