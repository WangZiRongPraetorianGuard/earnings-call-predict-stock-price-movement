tough decision time manage thing within control company management team action announced today designed preserve flexibility capitalize future recovery market expect market recover remain confident cyclical also operate industry significant longterm tailwind decarbonization effort driving transition steel electric arc furnace continue increase share total steel production eaf method steelmaking account nearly half global steel production outside china increase market share growth nearly every region trend eaf share growth expected continue fact continue see example government providing incentive company help fund investment new eaf capacity ongoing transition toward eaf steelmaking expected drive demand growth graphite electrode longer term overall considering planned eaf capacity addition based steel producer announcement along production increase existing eaf plant estimate would translate global graphite electrode demand outside china growing cagr next five year seen change competitive dynamic late jeremy indicated entirely unexpected point cycle view largely transitory well positioned benefit longterm demand growth graphite electrode note reason first prior cycle demonstrated anticipated recovery graphite electrode demand coming year help ease current competitive pricing pressure historical reference point last year selling price nonlta volume averaged approximately per metric ton adjusted inflation significantly current market price second anticipated demand growth petroleum needle coke raw material use produce graphite electrode also present pricing tailwind expand point needle coke demand expected accelerate driven use produce synthetic graphite anode portion lithium ion battery used electric vehicle market growing demand needle coke result elevated needle coke pricing given high historical correlation petroleum needle coke pricing graphite electrode pricing inflationadjusted spread averaged approximately per metric ton last year trend translate higher market pricing electrode third specific competition chinese graphite electrode producer continue view opportunity competitive inroad key market limited longer term imposition custom duty tariff protection key eaf steelmaking region including yous eu served limit level import china import china region quality gap still exists chinese electrode tier producer become increasingly evident new eafs demanding application come online coming year relates china domestic graphite electrode demand country produce approximately billion metric ton steel annual basis approximately still produced using traditional method steelmaking even relatively small percentage shift output environmentally friendly eaf model would absorb significant level domestic graphite

squeezing question kind want maybe touch regional difference seeing kind outlook side primarily yous europe like guess seeing term competition difference two area maybe relates seeing graphite electrode pricing kind maybe sense capacity utilization region thankstim flanagan interim chief executive officer yes thanks abe term outlook region really follows macro story broadly right yous remained fairly healthy market u steel utilization rate continue mids europe market certainly challenged economic standpoint think capacity utilization europe ended year range thereby kind deduce kind overall quality intensity market term competition tariff protection yous europe yous tariff place chinese import europe indian chinese import yes market kind capacity utilization look network certainly continue going forward global manufacturing footprint provide kind capacity utilization plant think really relevant term look businessabe landa bank america merrill lynch analyst nontier competition kind different europe versus yous intensity impact pricing notice difference reallytim flanagan interim chief executive officer mean see much presence europe either chinese indian right tier player one part incumbent market see small indian presence yous know would say intensity different rightabe landa bank america merrill lynch analyst got kind cost rationalization footprint plan kind mentioned third point operating reduced level think kind mentioned taking ton walk u thinking implementing expect trend kind yeartim flanagan interim chief executive officer yes really three thing one idling st mary right taking production activity st mary location also looked asset across entire footprint asset said one efficient best optimize utilization asset another subset asset plant continuing run stop running otherwise consider part productive capacity combination two thing remaining footprint inform million sorry metric ton capacity measure utilization going forward respect commentary around matching production operating footprint relative commercial demand ton part capacity scale production demand right need conscious working capital going efficiently possible continue operate much like done scaled back operation various point time ensure alignment overall demandabe landa bank america merrill lynch analyst seems like potentially room maybe idle certain asset longer kind better match reason market take downturn right way maybe look ittim flanagan interim chief executive officer yeah mean would say idled asset think best position u navigate view market exists
