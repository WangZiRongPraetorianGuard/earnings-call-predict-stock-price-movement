first quarter qa webcast name martin viecha vp investor relation joined today elon musk vaibhav taneja number executive q result announced pm central time update deck published link webcast call discus business outlook make forwardlooking statement comment based prediction expectation today actual event result could differ materially due number risk uncertainty including mentioned recent filing sec questionandanswer portion today call please limit one question one followupplease use raise hand button join question queue jump qa elon opening remark elon elon musk chief executive officer product architect thanks martin recap q navigated several unforeseen challenge well ramp updated model fremont seen ev adoption rate globally pressure lot order manufacturer pulling back ev pursuing plugin hybrid instead believe right strategy electric vehicle ultimately dominate market despite challenge tesla team great job executing tough environment energy storage deployment megapack particular reached alltime high q leading record profitability energy business look likely continue increase quarter year ahead increase actually know significantly faster car business expected also continue expand ai training capacity q doubling training compute sequentially term new product road map lot talk upcoming vehicle line next past several week updated future vehicle lineup accelerate launch new model ahead previously mentioned start production second half expect like early late year new vehicle including affordable model use aspect nextgeneration platform well aspect current platform able produce manufacturing line current vehicle lineup contingent upon new factory massive new production line made current production line much efficiently think allow u get million vehicle capacity realized full extent regarding fsd version pure aibased selfdriving experienced strongly urge try profound rate improvement rapid turned car camera inference computer everything hardware north america pushed think around million vehicle seeing half people use far percentage increasing passing week billion mile driven fsd v since launch full selfdriving supervised full selfdriving become clear visionbased approach endtoend neural network right solution scalable autonomy really human drive entire road network designed biological neural net eye naturally camera digital neural net solution current road system make accessible reduced subscription price month easy try announced showcasing purposebuilt robotaxi cybercab august yeah regarding ai compute past month actively working expanding tesla core ai infrastructure training constrained progress point longer trainingconstrained making rapid progress installed commissioned meaning actually working h computer gpus gpu wrong word need new word always feel like wince say gpu gpu stand g stand graphic graphic know roughly h active expect probably thereabouts end year training training making sure efficient possible training number h efficiently used conclusion super excited autonomy road map think obvious anyone driving version matter time exceed reliability human much time really headed electric vehicle autonomous future go back something said several year ago future gasoline car autonomous like riding horse using flip phone become obvious hindsight continue make necessary investment drive growth profit tesla future wanted thank tesla team incredible execution period look forward everything planned ahead nextmartin viecha thank much vaibhav comment wellvaibhav taneja chief financial officer important acknowledge elon said auto business perspective see decline revenue quarter quarter primarily seasonality uncertain macroeconomic environment reason elon mentioned earlier auto margin declined excluding impact cybertruck impact pricing action largely offset reduction perunit cost recognition revenue autopilot feature certain vehicle yous previously functionality additionally experience higher cost due ramp model fremont disruption berlin cost largely offset costreduction initiative fact exclude cybertruck fremont model ramp cost revenue auto margin improved slightly currently normalized model cost per vehicle austin berlin already close fremont ability reduce cost without sacrificing quality due amazing effort team executing tesla relentless pursuit efficiency across business also witnessed oems pulling back investment ev increasing appetite credit mean steady stream revenue u obviously seeing others pull back ev future want would prefer whole industry went demand front undertaken variety initiative including lowering price purchase subscription option launching extremely attractive leasing special model yous month offering attractive financing option certain market believe awareness activity paired attractive financing go long way expanding reach driving demand product energy business continues make meaningful progress margin reaching record expect energy storage deployment grow least higher accordingly business begin contributing significantly overall profitability note bit lumpiness storage deployment due variety factor outside control deployment may fluctuate quarter quarter operating expense front saw sequential increase ai initiative continued investment future project marketing activity negative free cash flow billion first quarter primary driver increase inventory mismatch build delivery discussed elevated spend capex across various initiative including ai compute expect inventory build reverse second quarter free cash flow return positive prepare company next phase growth make hard necessary decision reduce head count saving generated expected well excess billion annual run rate basis also getting hyperfocused capex efficiency utilizing installed capacity efficient manner saving initiative including cost reduction help improve overall profitability ultimately enable u increase scale investment ai conclusion future extremely bright journey get challenging extremely rewarding would like thank whole tesla team delivering great result open qamartin viecha ok let u start investor qa first question status current output larslars moravy vice president vehicle engineering sure production increased q reaching greater inaudible cybertruck gigawatt hour per year posted x expect stay ahead cybertruck ramp cell production throughout q ramp third four line phase maintaining multiple week cell inventory make sure ahead ramp ramping cog continues drop rapidly week week driven yield improvement throughout line production volume increase goal expect beat supplier cost nickelbased cell end yearmartin viecha thank second question optimus current status optimus currently performing factory task expect start mass productionelon musk chief executive officer product architect able simple factory task least say factory task lab think optimus limited production natural factory useful task end year think may able sell externally end next year guess said think optimus valuable everything else combined got sentient humanoid robot able navigate reality task request meaningful limit size economy going happen think tesla best positioned humanoid robot maker able reach volume production efficient inference robot mean perhaps point worth emphasizing tesla ai inference efficiency vastly better company company even close inference efficiency tesla constrained inference hardware car choice pay dividend many waysmartin viecha third question current assessment pathway toward regulatory approval unsupervised fsd yous think appropriate safety threshold compared human driverslars moravy vice president vehicle engineering start handful state already adopted autonomous vehicle law state paving way operation data operation guide broader adoption driverless vehicle think ashok talk little bit safety methodology expect state work ongoing well data providing pave way broadbased regulatory approval yous least country wellelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah actually pretty helpful autonomous car company cutting path regulatory jungle actually quite helpful obviously operating san francisco think got approval city vale approval happening rapidly think got scale statistically significant amount data show conclusively autonomous car let u say half accident rate humandriven car think difficult ignore point stopping autonomy mean killing people actually think significant regulatory barrier provided conclusive data autonomous car safer humandriven car view much like elevator elevator used operated guy relay switch sometimes guy would get tired drunk make mistake send somebody half floor get elevator press button think fact kind weird somebody standing relay switch car work summon car using phone get take destination get outvaibhav taneja chief financial officer even think itelon musk chief executive officer product architect even think like elevator take floor think elevator working anything like something clarify tesla operating fleet think like tesla think combination airbnb uber meaning number car tesla owns operates fleet number car bunch car owned end user end user add subtract car fleet whenever want decide want let car used friend family buy fivestar user anyone time could car come back exclusively like airbnb could rent guest room time want fleet grows million car going million car going eventually ten million car worldwide constant feedback loop every time something go wrong get added training data get training flywheel happening way google search sort flywheel difficult compete google people constantly search clicking google getting feedback loop tesla scale maybe difficult comprehend ultimately ten million think also potential aws element road got powerful inference got hardware car car made hardware hardware pretty much designed car hopefully toward end next year potential run car moving actually run distributed inference kind like aws distributed inference like take lot computer train ai model many order magnitude le compute run imagine future perhaps fleet million tesla average got like maybe kilowatt inference compute gigawatts inference compute distributed around world pretty hard put together gigawatts ai compute even autonomous future car perhaps used instead used hour week used hour week still leaf hour week car inference computer could something else seems like waste use itmartin viecha ashok want chime process safetyashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah multiple year validating safety given week train hundred neural network produce different trajectory drive car replay million clip already collected user qa like critical event like someone jumping front like critical event gathered database many many year replay make sure net improving safety simulation system also try create test close fashion validated give qa network hundred different city san francisco los angeles austin new york lot different location also driving collecting realworld mile estimate critical event net improvement compared previousweek build confidence build net improvement start shipping early user like employee initially would like build give feedback like improvement noting new issue capture qa process validated go external customer even go external like live dashboard monitoring every critical event happening fleet sorted criticality constant pulse build quality safety improvement along way failure like elon alluded get data back add training improves model next cycle like constant feedback loop issue fix evaluation rinse repeat especially new v architecture automatically improving without requiring much engineering intervention sense engineer creative like code algorithm mostly learning based data see ok every failure like person chooses drive intersection something like get data back add neural network learns trained data automatically instead engineer saying oh must rotate steering wheel much something like hard inference condition everything neural network pretty soft probabilistic adopt probabilistic distribution based new data gettingelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah insight good thing like let u say three four month advanced model far capable car issue need fix step change improvement capability car quirk need addressed order release ashok saying careful release fleet customer general look say really could arguably even version version pretty close total retrain neural net case substantially different good insight model well car perform say three four monthsashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah term scaling loss people community generally talk model scaling loss increase model size lot corresponding gain performance also figured scaling loss access addition model side scaling making also data scaling increase amount data use train neural network also give similar gain also scale training compute train much longer one gpus dojo node also give better performance also architecture scaling count better architecture amount compute produce better result combination model size scaling data scaling training compute scaling architecture scaling basically extrapolate ok continue scaling based ratio perfect big future performance obviously take time experiment take week train take week collect ten million video clip process estimate going future progress based trend seen past generally held true based past datamartin viecha ok thank much go next question get official announcement time line vehiclelars moravy vice president vehicle engineering think elon mentioned opening remark mentioned updating future vehicle lineup accelerate launch lowcost vehicle capexefficient way mission get affordable car customer fast possible new vehicle built existing line open capacity major shift utilize capacity marginal capex go spend high capexelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah talk august really way think tesla almost entirely term solving autonomy able turn autonomy gigantic fleet think might biggest asset value appreciation history day happens unsupervised full selfdrivinglars moravy vice president vehicle engineering five million carselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah million car year million eventually talking ten million car eventually like end year yeah decade several ten million car thinkmartin viecha thank next question progress cybertruck ramplars moravy vice president vehicle engineering take one cybertruck k week couple week ago happened first four five month since sop late last year course volume production matter drive cost cost dropping ramp still face like lot challenge many new technology supplier limitation etc continue ramp year focusing cost efficiency qualitymartin viecha ok thank next question legacy automaker contacted tesla possibly licensing fsd futureelon musk chief executive officer product architect conversation one major automaker regarding licensing fsdmartin viecha thank next question robotaxi elon already talked wait till august following question nextgeneration vehicle already talked let u go semi time line scaling semilars moravy vice president vehicle engineering finalizing engineering semi enable like super costeffective highvolume production learning fleet pilot fleet pepsi fleet expanding year marginally parallel showed shareholder deck started construction factory reno first vehicle planned late external customer starting martin viecha ok couple question favorite make fsd transfer permanent fsd fully delivered level autonomylars moravy vice president vehicle engineering yesmartin viecha ok next question getting production ramp lathrop see megapack run rate end year mikeunknown speaker yeah lathrop ramping planned second ga line allowing u increase exit rate gigawatt hour per year start year gigawatt hour per year end year line commissioned really nothing limiting ramp given longer sale cycle large project typically order visibility month prior ship date able plan build plan several quarter advance allows u ramp factory align business order growth lastly would like thank customer globally trust tesla partner incredible projectsmartin viecha let u go analyst question first question come tony sacconaghi bernstein tony please go ahead unmutetony sacconaghi alliancebernstein analyst thank taking question wondering elaborate little bit kind new vehicle talked today like tweak existing model given going running line like new model think context like model highland update model like relative given quick time frame model highland required lot work lot retooling maybe help put context followup pleaseelon musk chief executive officer product architect think said front followuptony sacconaghi alliancebernstein analyst personal one elon leading many important company right maybe talk heart term interest expect lessen involvement tesla point next three yearselon musk chief executive officer product architect well constitutes majority work time work pretty much every day week rare take sunday afternoon going make sure tesla quite prosperous like prosperous much futuremartin viecha ok thank let u go adam jonas morgan stanley adam please go ahead go ahead unmuteadam jonas morgan stanley analyst ok great hey elon team volume expect growth rate notably lower achieved team degree confidence growth word statement leave room potentially lower sale year yearelon musk chief executive officer product architect think higher sale year last yearadam jonas morgan stanley analyst ok followup elon future product nailed execution assuming nail execution nextgen cheaper vehicle aggressive giga casting want say one piece getting closer say onepiece structural pack unboxed mile range price point putting aside robotaxi feature unique long would take best chinese competitor copy cheaper better vehicle could offer couple year long would take best chinese competitor copy thankselon musk chief executive officer product architect mean know competitor except done relatively better look drop competitor china sale versus drop sale drop le well think cathie wood said best like really thought ai robotics company value tesla like auto company fundamentally wrong framework ask wrong question right answer impossible mean somebody believe tesla going solve autonomy think investor company like car go hour use week like hour half day probably cost samevaibhav taneja chief financial officer think key thing remember right especially look fsd supervised believe autonomy give review coming actually getting better day dayelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah tried fsd like said going significantly better even better visibility thing really understand going possiblevaibhav taneja chief financial officer yeah look car company car company would car car company car autonomous like said happeningashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah addition testa ai community like increasing improving rapidlyelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah mean putting actual auto automobile sort go like well sort like tell u future horse carriage making like well actually need horse whole point really whole pointmartin viecha ok thank next question come alex potter piper sandler alex please go ahead unmutealex potter piper sandler analyst great thanks yes could agree thesis hinge completely ai future ai full selfdriving neural net training thing context elon spoken desire obtain voting control company understand completely would necessarily asking asking come mechanism ensure obtain level voting control core part thesis could potentially risk additional commentary might topicelon musk chief executive officer product architect well think matter tesla even get kidnapped alien tomorrow tesla solve autonomy maybe little slower would solve autonomy vehicle least know would win respect optimus respect future product would enough momentum tesla solve autonomy even disappeared vehicle yes whole range thing future beyond reticent respect optimus supersentient humanoid robot follow indoors escape talking terminatorlevel risk yes would uncomfortable meaningful level influence deployed shareholder opportunity ratify reratify sort competition say fact opportunity yes see company generates lot positive cash flow could obviously buy back sharesalex potter piper sandler analyst right actually helpful context thank maybe one final question pas opex reduction thank quantifying impact would interested also potentially qualitative discussion implication headcount reduction type activity presumably sacrificing result parting way folk thanks muchvaibhav taneja chief financial officer know like said done headcount reduction across board company grow time certain redundancy duplication effort happens certain area need go back look pocket get rid basically going exercise wherein like hey set company right next phase growth way think tree grows need pruning pruning exercise went end much stronger much resilient deal future future really bright like said opening remark get period get thereelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah giving anything significant aware long period prosperity company sort organizationally wrong per year accumulates inefficiency made correction along way time reorganize company next phase growth really need reorganize like human start one cell kind zygote kind blastocyst start growing arm leg briefly tailalex potter piper sandler analyst would tailelon musk chief executive officer product architect would tail hopefully baby basically organism company kind like creature growing reorganize different phase growth fail organizational structure cell versus versus million versus billion versus trillion human around trillion cell feel like feel like one person basically walking cell colony roughly trillion depending body mass three time number bacteria anyway got reorganize company new phase growth fail achieve growthmartin viecha thank let u go mark delaney goldman sachs mark please go ahead unmutemark delaney goldman sachs analyst yes good afternoon thanks much taking question company previously characterized potential fsd licensing discussion early phase oems really believing elaborate much licensing business opportunity mentioned today progressed anything tesla need achieve technology term product milestone order successful reaching licensing agreement viewelon musk chief executive officer product architect well think need need obvious approach right approach think think car drive around obvious solution relatively lowcost inference computer standard camera achieve selfdriving lidar radar ultrasonic nothingvaibhav taneja chief financial officer heavy integration work vehicle manufacturerselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah really case use camera inference computer licensing software becomes obvious car nobody want car smart car still remember fact nokia king hill yeah cellphone crushing saw come smartphone basically brick limited functionality iphone android people still understand phone going way going flip phone niche product home phone yeah even exactly last time saw whole book like idea yeahvaibhav taneja chief financial officer hotel sometimes hotelselon musk chief executive officer product architect yes hotel people understand car need smart car sell car nobody would buy becomes obvious think licensing becomes optionallars moravy vice president vehicle engineering becomes method survivalelon musk chief executive officer product architect yes absolutely license nobody buy carvaibhav taneja chief financial officer mean one thing add conversation oems want also point take lot time product life cycle talking year put product might licensing deal earlier take big difference u iselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah mean really deal signed would result car probably three yearsvaibhav taneja chief financial officer would earlyelon musk chief executive officer product architect like lightning basicallyvaibhav taneja chief financial officer eager oemelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah would surprised sign deal think good chance sign deal year maybe one yes would probably three year integrated car even though need camera inference computer talking massive design changevaibhav taneja chief financial officer yes clarify work work take time right markmark delaney goldman sachs analyst yeah helpful followup better understand tesla approach pricing going forward previously company said price reduction driving incremental demand affordable car become especially vehicle access ira credit leasing offer tesla place still see meaningful incremental price reduction making sense existing product company meaningfully lower price also stay free cash flow positive annual basis current product setelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah think free cash flow positive meaningfullylars moravy vice president vehicle engineering think vaibhav said opening remark like costdown effort basically offsetting price cut like trying give back customerselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah mean end day like given company sell great product great price great product great price sale excellent true area time need keep making sure great product great price moreover price accessible people solve value money fundamental affordability question fundamental affordability question sometimes overlooked somebody earning several hundred thousand dollar year think car fundamental affordability standpoint vast majority people living paycheck paycheck actually make difference cost per month lease refinancing one way important keep improving affordability keep making price lars moravy vice president vehicle engineering accessibleelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah exactly make price accessible value money better keep improving timelars moravy vice president vehicle engineering also kick as people want buyelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah going great product great price standard constitutes great product great price keep increasing like static keep making car better improving price improving cost production doingvaibhav taneja chief financial officer yeah fact like said opening remark also like revised updated model fantastic car think people fully even understand amount engineering effort gone lars team actually put video explaining much car different mean look feel different look feel different added much value lease like low monthlars moravy vice president vehicle engineering without gasvaibhav taneja chief financial officer yeahmartin viecha right next question come george canaccord george please go ahead unmutegeorge gianarikas canaccord genuity analyst hi thank taking question first could please help u understand timing launching fsd additional geography including maybe clarifying recent comment china thank youelon musk chief executive officer product architect mean like new market yeah bunch market currently sell car selling car see acceleration thatgeorge gianarikas canaccord genuity analyst fsd new marketselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah think endtoend neural netbased autonomy like human actually work pretty well without modification almost market plan approval regulator releasing supervised autonomy system market get regulatory approval think includes china yes like human go rent car foreign country drive pretty well obviously live country drive better make car drive better country countryspecific training drive quite well almost everywherevaibhav taneja chief financial officer basic driving basically everywhere like car car traffic light road roadelon musk chief executive officer product architect understands hit thing matter road rule arevaibhav taneja chief financial officer exactly road rule need follow china cross solid line lane change yous recommendation think china get fined heavily action mostly smaller adoption like entire change stack something like thatmartin viecha hey george followupgeorge gianarikas canaccord genuity analyst yeah followup first quarter delivery curious whether feel supply constraint mentioned throughout release impacted result maybe help u quantify confidence unit growth vaibhav taneja chief financial officer yeah think cover little bit opening remark q lot different thing happening seasonality big one continued pressure macroeconomic environment attack factory red sea attack ramping model ramping cybertruck thing happening mean almost feel like culmination activity constrained period give u confidence hey expect thing recurelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah think q lot better yeahlars moravy vice president vehicle engineering one thing another crazyelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah exactly got car sitting ship obviously delivered people got excess demand model model one market quite extremely complex logistics situation would say also overcomplicate sale process past week greatly simplified became far complex buy tesla whereas buy car minute getting back buy tesla minute interface quite complexmartin viecha ok thank let u go colin rusch oppenheimer colin unmute please colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy given pursuit tesla really leader ai physical world comment around distributed inference talk approach unlocking beyond happening vehicle right nowelon musk chief executive officer product architect ashok want say somethingashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah like elon mentioned like car even full robotaxi probably going used hour weekelon musk chief executive officer product architect guess like third hour weekashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah could le certainly going hour left charging cleaning maintenance world lot workload even right seeing example llm company batch workload send bunch document run pretty large neural network take lot compute chunk workload already paid compute car might wise use let like buying lot expensive machinery leaving idle want want use computer much possible close like basically time make full use itelon musk chief executive officer product architect think analogous amazon web service people expect aws would valuable part amazon started bookstore nobody radar found excess compute compute need would spike extreme level brief period year idle compute rest year pull excess compute rest year kind yeah monetize seems like kind nobrainer say ok got million ten million vehicle computer idle time might well something useful mean get like million vehicle level think point get got kilowatt useable compute maybe hardware time really think could order gigawatts useful compute might anyone company probably company ashok elluswamy director autopilot software yeah probably take lot intelligence drive car anyway driving car put intelligence us solving scientific problem like human answering dumb question someone elseelon musk chief executive officer product architect already learned deploying workload compute nodesashok elluswamy director autopilot software unlike laptop cellphone totally tesla control easier distribute workload across different node opposed opposed asking user permission cellphone would tediouselon musk chief executive officer product architect well draining battery phone like technically suppose like apple would amount distributed compute use get run phone full power drain battery car even kilowattlevel inference computer crazy power compared phone got kilowatthour pack still big deal whether plugged could plugged like could run hour use kilowatt hour kilowatt compute powerlars moravy vice president vehicle engineering got builtin like liquidcooled thermal management yes exactly data center already carelon musk chief executive officer product architect exactly distributed power generation distributed access power distributed cooling already paid forashok elluswamy director autopilot software yes mean distributed power cooling people underestimate cost lot moneyvaibhav taneja chief financial officer yes capex shared entire world sort everyone owns small chunk get small profit maybeelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeahcolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy followup little bit mundane looking ramp talk close target yield might start accelerate incremental capacity expansion technologyelon musk chief executive officer product architect know making good progress think super important least near term lars said think exceed competitiveness supplier end year continue improvelars moravy vice president vehicle engineering yes mean think important note also like ramp right relevant cybertruck ramp like going randomly build unless place put going make sure prudent also lot investment cell supplier vendor great partner done great development work u lot advancement technology chemistry also putting cellselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah mean big part tesla internal cell hedge would happen supplier difficult every big carmaker put massive battery order price per kilowatt hour lithiumion battery went crazy number crazy levelsvaibhav taneja chief financial officer bonkerselon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah bonkers like ok got hedge deal cost per kilowatt hour number double anticipated internal cell production hedge demand shock much demand really way think like want take whole bunch problem hell cell program order address crazy increase cost per kilowatt hour supplier due gigantic order placed every carmaker earthmartin viecha ok thank last question come ben kallo baird ben go ahead unmute ben still mutedelon musk chief executive officer product architect well want say would like strongly recommend anyone guess thinking tesla stock really drive really impossible understand company martin viecha right since ben unmuting let u try shreyas patil wolfe research final questionshreyas patil wolfe research analyst hey thanks much elon investor day last year mentioned auto cog per unit nextgen vehicle would decline versus current think implying something around cog third coming onbox manufacturing process curious see opportunity driver around powertrain cost reduction material cost saving would largely transferable new product talking introducinglars moravy vice president vehicle engineering yeah sure mean short yes mean like onbox manufacturing method certainly great revolutionary come risk new production line subsystem developed whether powertrains drive unit battery improvement manufacturing automation thermal system seating integration interior component reduction lv controller transferable trying get product fast possible yes engineering work trying throw away put cough going take utilize utilize best advantage car make futureshreyas patil wolfe research analyst ok great topic cell know mentioned really thought like hedge rising battery cost oems seems even today seems like would cost advantage automaker wondering given rationalizing vehicle manufacturing plan talking opportunity maybe convert cell maybe sell automaker really generate additional revenue stream curious thought thatelon musk chief executive officer product architect great seems happening net missing something order battery automaker declined dramatically seeing much competitive price sale supplier dramatically competitive past clear lot supplier excess capacityunknown speaker yeah addition elon said coming way addition elon said u supply chain perspective help u understand supply chain upstream cell supplier lot deal struck also supply material partner reducing overall cost back tesla basically inserting upstream supply chain also beneficial reducing overall pricing addition excess capacity supplier haveelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah mean going wax wane obviously going boom bust battery cell production production exceeds supply supply exceeds production back forth kind like know dram something like true today true future going somewhat boomandbust cycle additional complication government incentive like inflation reduction act ira always found like funny name comical name yeah like irish republican army internet research agency russiavaibhav taneja chief financial officer independent retirement accountelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah exactly roth ira like spiderman situation ira win complicate incentive structure stronger demand cell produced yous outside yous long ira last knowunknown speaker important inaudible hedge thismartin viecha ok thank much time today time would like make short announcement wanted let investment community know month ago met elon vaibhav announced moving world investor relation hanging around another couple month feel free reach time sevenyear sprint going taking break spending good quality time family wanted say seven year greatest privilege professional life never forget memory started literally beginning production hell watching company inside see become today especially super thankful people room dozen people outside room worked year think team strength teamwork tesla unlike anything else seen career elon thank much opportunity got back thank seeking investor feedback regularly debating meelon musk chief executive officer product architect yeah well mean reason reached thought analysis tesla best seen yes thank helping tesla get today seven year pleasure working youmartin viecha thank much yeah thank thousand shareholder met year walked around factory loved interaction even tough one yeah looking forward call next three month side
