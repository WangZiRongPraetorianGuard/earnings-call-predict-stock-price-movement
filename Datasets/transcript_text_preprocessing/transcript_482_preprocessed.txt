regard given specific volume growth number across specific quarter mentioned expect growth year really growth trajectory year dependent quickly ramp existing asset startup momentstephen richardson evercore isi analyst thanks maybe follow specific asset k look like filed suggests looking number atacama flat year year could give u update salar expansion status chile right term incremental volumeskent master chairman president chief executive officer yeah start eric fill little bit salar operating capacity done expansion la negra need brine feed expansion complete need brine salar feed commissioning salar yield project project provide additional brine work way brine system end feeding la negra project think probably eric sixmonth lag roughly solar perspectiveeric norris president lithium yeah mean virgin brine pump think rule sum like month salar yield six month commissioned middle last year enabling steve growth see range big chunk coming carbonate chile la negra plant enabled salar yieldstephen richardson evercore isi analyst perfect thanks muchoperatoryour next question come line colin rusch oppenheimer line opencolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy talk little bit looking trigger either slowing reaccelerating capex investment balance yearkent master chairman president chief executive officer yes mean blunt think going pricing level see trend see see demand volume growth industry start seeing project come operating project well project book like one described u kind reaccelerate need get better view pricing longterm view well think price today unsustainable operating cash level asset currently operating definitely reinvestment level said particularly west particular price kick necessarily range project individual depending resource located cost position conversion asset located one number look look project project going spot price hit number going necessarily turn u back investment mode need view longterm number would rely life assetcolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much talked inventory level industry past wanted get updated view think normalized inventory level channel keep thing healthy moving seeing right term inventory hand channeleric norris president lithium hey colin hi eric spent lot time looking inventory drawdown effect throughout last year year top supply chain upstream looking lithium salt even nextlevel cathode production feel inventory normalized drawdown seeing harder predict understand le visible u battery cell battery module ev level lot report vary highly quantitative highly known number think probably couple month excess exited last year drawn year going affect apparent demand demand forecast difference look remember slide lithium supply slide toward back deck lithium demand growth ev growth drawdown effect happening battery ev levelstephen richardson evercore isi analyst super helpful thanks much guysoperatoryour next question come line steve byrne bank america line opensteve byrne bank america merrill lynch analyst yeah maybe continuing discussion see glut inventory driving spot price spodumene inventory converter really glut material iseric norris president lithium hey steve repeat said upstream seeing large inventory level actually seeing project spodumene project going care maintenance several canada excuse australia one canada others questionable watching closely conversion level track well well direct consumer u cathode company high visibility one point fairly high year ago since come inventory seeing downstream saying earlier battery ev level supply chain affecting apparent demand lithium industry albeit ev growing quite healthily see year going forwardsteve byrne bank america merrill lynch analyst would say driving spot price hydroxide meaningfully lower carbonate china make sense cut operating rate tighten market drive inflectioneric norris president lithium look answer price question maybe kent would like comment broader supply question price question think seeing china particular let u remember china almost threequarters twothirds three quarter lithium supply consumed china much market thing set trend strongly toward past year toward carbonate lfp production trend opposite part world developing like europe north america although seeing lfp interest two product starting balance looking closer mix although watch move time technology scale economy develop causing near term putting thing upside historically hydroxide higher carbonate near term seeing flip would expect revert time industry grows want comment supply broader kentkent master chairman president chief executive officer yeah mean anything much add mean think know supply hydroxide carbonate tend supply carbonate chile capacity growing talked little bit earlier supply lfp market trying balanced hydroxide carbonate catch growing trend little bit skewed toward carbonate moment think hydroxide catch question lower rate kind bring back balance still ramping still seeing growth market know year u year market little bit stronger think demand catch without u adjust operating rate still trying commission plant catch thatsteve byrne bank america merrill lynch analyst thank youoperatoryour next question come line josh spector ubs line openjosh spector ubs analyst hi good morning couple question around pricing scenario talk kilogram asia market implied scenario term albemarle realized pricing really getting toward kind impact floor meaningful anythings changed regardseric norris president lithium yes josh bit complicated picture may know varied price index china outside china inside china tend lower structural difference vat aspect drive event look average price across two going higher index generally couple reason particularly price go low one floor price little sticky even though link index mix tend biased outside china said price go trend asp average selling price followsjosh spector ubs analyst ebitda kind range versus versus change ebitda range floor high teen low would increment bigger stepup guess would missing mathneal sheorey chief financial officer josh might need look math actually transition different scenario little bit different actually averaging math scenario see little bit different jump three different scenariosjosh spector ubs analyst ok follow offline thanksoperatoryour next question come line jeff zekauskas jpmorgan line openjeff zekauskas jpmorgan chase company analyst thanks much question specialty forecast next year midpoint assume ebitda revenue flat last year first quarter think specialty ebitda something like maybe finished year know something close get flat ebitda base casenetha johnson president bromine specialty yeah hi jeff netha think look way projecting way pricing play throughout year right first quarter little bit challenging yearoveryear comparison standpoint still saw number saw growth q last year decline really really steep driven pricing play annual basis u think get back last year maybe upside downside based range provided pricing expect see going forward neal stated really secondhalf ramp market volume market pricing see coming really driven look forward indicator semiconductor u good proxy electronics already first quarter alonejeff zekauskas jpmorgan chase company analyst ok followup talk cash flow expectation year free cash flow expectation neal sheorey chief financial officer yeah hi sorry jeffjeff zekauskas jpmorgan chase company analyst sureneal sheorey chief financial officer sorry neal jeff good morning yes obviously several thing motion right regard cash flow want put finer point working regard operating cash flow obviously already mentioned working hard aligning opex current pricing market also working several operational thing working capital perspective expect deflationary environment continue release cash working capital additionally looking lever pull reduce inventory network example investor well aware long time mine customer natural supply chain looking way reduce harvest cash course free cash flow standpoint reducing capex kent mentioned earlier addition also call nonoperational cash flow item working thing looking working capital balance generating financing said realize people may want rule thumb think think thing cash conversion standpoint obviously depend lithium scenario cash conversion look last three four year company averaged conversion plus minus one example use think model operating cash flowjeff zekauskas jpmorgan chase company analyst great thank muchoperatoryour next question come line vincent andrew morgan stanley line openvincent andrew morgan stanley analyst thank much good morning maybe following looking balance sheet yearend know receivables year year inventory year year payable flat know obviously lithium price ended year much lower end end bridge caused working capital build despite lower pricesneal sheorey chief financial officer yeah good morning vincent thing think one important one regard inventory remember several asset startup natural build inventory continue see extent build inventory work commissioning startup new facility around world remember timing aspect well timing shipment flow working capital look endofyear punctual period necessarily see impact timing shipment take snapshot end year might accurately reflect sort lag supply chain know link question vincent also jeff asked know think whatever lithium price scenario think working capital cash release know depending scenario pick use scenario put deck looking sale decline somewhere billion billion depending scenario historically use rule thumb company working capital around sale expect release cash tune million billion depending course scenario evolve vincent andrew morgan stanley analyst helpful thank ask refresh u return invested capital looking put capex work energy storage business know want define differently geography sort rough hurdle rate evolved last year given price movementkent master chairman president chief executive officer yeah kind benchmark use say trough pricing want get cost capital double kind midcycle pricing know number moved around u kind still aim project look believe trough pricing would generate cost capital kind twice midcycle pricing average pricingvincent andrew morgan stanley analyst thanks much guysoperatoryour next question come line dave begleiter deutsche bank line opendave begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank good morning neal welcome aboard kent eric energy storage ebitda guidance market guidance current price assuming change price rest year much lower would ebitda guidance energy storageneal sheorey chief financial officer yeah hi david good morning look think provided number people interpolate would like different lithium price scenario interpolation based think market price moment caution would give think lowerprice scenario think question getting see scenario get level unreasonable think bumping floor contract varying price level see math scenario would necessarily take interpolation one one going scenario givendave begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood eric lepidolite production china much think shut much expect shut shut till lepidolite production chinaeric norris president lithium well thanks question david couple thing would say look shutin capacity capacity exited market general big chunk lepidolite also nonintegrated spodumene spodumene come offline come offline high cost current spodumene cost even price rather well cost current spodumene price ton total come lepidolite probably close maybe third half somewhere range nonintegrated lepidolite production come integrated lepidolite production weaker grade well price well cash cost hard u know know economics necessarily understand still operating otherwise know know math tell u coming offline quite understand going still quite bit still capacity market well like said current price cost well pricesdave begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank youoperatoryour next question come line joe jackson bmo capital market line openjoel jackson bmo capital market analyst hi guy sure joe jackson want ask question sale guidance energy storage take guide ton volume ton energy storage last year would imply sale bit billion maybe billion energy storage year going think billion something like million million difference sale accounting thing spodumene explain pleaseneal sheorey chief financial officer hi joel accounting thing wondering volume using range set scenario based range volume put slide deck adjusted range based definitely accounting noise revenue number additionally say maybe explains remember energy storage total product energy storage necessarily move one one lithium market price maybe another piece math well yeahjoel jackson bmo capital market analyst ok fair enough wanted also ask know yous strategy know industry really looking regional supply chain really going go king mountain yous megaflex put plan hold still permitting course king mountain know take sometimes get mine permitted state important yous strategy going something maybe reassess doe dod different funding option help revive like seemed like little bit damper objective political industrykent master chairman president chief executive officer yeah think big impact building say west called europe north america focus bit focused north america access great resource king mountain price today economics project continue progress said permitting kind real long lead time item real capital intensive anticipation price coming back would able investment support another way maybe could pushed mean richburg know canceled project delayed still long lead time permitting construction stopped engineering work king mountain progressing permitting long lead time hope work solution requires better pricing order execute project kind two best opportunity start supply chain need lot support would first project would bring market north america probably others well particularly around resourcesoperatorour next question come line mike sison well fargo line openmike sison well fargo security analyst hey good morning could remind u given new capex plan know capacity end could give u update think unfold know think capacity offer market next several yearseric norris president lithium depending land mike eric depending land range talking something could close going get close ton ton top end driven specific production chile discussed earlier realizing efficiency solar yield project bottlenecking capacity downstream la negra drive growth also driven increased spodumene production australia ramp kemerton qinzhou well meishan item time plan ramping nicely period time brings think future kemerton continue ramp go meishan start ramp interesting thing nearterm volume picture going looking sort plus volume growth year come based upon investment made already thing idled paused investment standpoint kent earlier referenced longer term sort really second half decade term going deliver impact slowing price stay low return investing project felt latter part decade also remind point time see industry supply already getting tight relative demand real challenge see demand slowing certainly see weakness certain part smallest market north america whole see strong growth challenging environment supply able meet long term good growth would say coming year sure multiple several year ahead uskent master chairman president chief executive officer yeah lead time getting investment book executing number year get project pulling back eric said impact back half decademike sison well fargo security analyst got quick followup figured guy better knowing potential lithium price know want get specific forecast think need happen get pricing back know greenfield economicskent master chairman president chief executive officer well mean price stay going see production come project come book eventually bring price balance happen hope hoping cycle lower high higher low start prevail anticipating cycle know still higher last low maybe quite mature anticipated need get lower high higher low consistency industry people see investment case new projectseric norris president lithium yeah understatement say mike price stay well marginal cash cost said thought would le volatile going see believe going see enough project ultimately come inflection point start get short supply move forward latter part decade middle part decade say excessively low price aggravate excessively high price potentially road challenge certainly customer would love see much moderated cycle market recover look try find way reduce volatility mix certainly would hope industry broadly well mike sison well fargo security analyst got thank youoperatoryour next question come line john robert mizuho line openjohn robert mizuho security analyst thank lower end volume growth include sequentially flat march quarter sequentially march quarter volumeneal sheorey chief financial officer sequentially fourth quarter question john robert mizuho security analyst correct year year neal sheorey chief financial officer yes yeah start year without growth sequentially eric norris president lithium yeah mean think going difference production sale think look happens seasonally ev year rapid rise december drop seasonally january production standpoint sequentially demand standpoint seasonal demand play role whole industry including usjohn robert mizuho security analyst ok slide industry ev growth lithium growth battery size getting smaller near term look like flip assumption full ev start end decade full electric start growing hybrid againeric norris president lithium yeah well hard generalize john mean think go region would tell china nice growth plugin hybrid last year reckoning estimate estimate beginning year anticipate plugin hybrid growth came expense internal combustion engine expense battery electric vehicle china largest market market europe past year seen opposite trend battery electric vehicle growing faster plugin hybrid yous smallest market pivot point see direction go lot discussion certain automotive producer struggling demand cost play think looking plugin hybrid alternative margin smallest market think least effect lithium demand large going back original question battery size grows may grow varying rate year year year grows time go forwardoperatorand final question come line kevin mccarthy vertical research partner line openkevin mccarthy vertical research partner analyst yes thank good morning would comment expected quarterly cadence phasing adjusted ebitda energy storage per kilogram scenario thought heard comment prepared remark would expect margin end year perhaps kind walk margin escalation expectationneal sheorey chief financial officer yeah couple thing kevin good morning neal couple thing think think quarterly ramp first mentioned prepared remark energy storage expect volume growth least twothirds volume growth occur back half year plant ramp remember still ramping facility first half year start see volume kick get back half year point number one point number two move particularly first quarter still working spodumene inventory higher priced mentioned prepared remark expect weigh margin first quarter nature inventory lag everyone familiar process spodumene margin start improve go year exit year sort stronger margin mentioned prepared remark thing normalize spodumene cost running pl indicative lithium salt price start see come margin strength energy storage business even lower priced environment would expect sitting best resource world would counsel think margin rising go year one part volume also another part work inventory lag get back half yearkevin mccarthy vertical research partner analyst make sense thank followup zoom lens look segment margin last cyclical trough lithium around old definition adjusted ebitda question would price persist per kilogram scenario think new trough margin could moving forward let u say plus mid level still representative indicative think would materially higher lower thateric norris president lithium mean jump mean think let tell variable answer going fairly similar believe factor one spodumene price indicative lithium price last year early part year accounting talked lag talked within talison dealing margin one benefit get u back talk last cyclical trough price even well lower earning ebitda margin difference spodumene smaller percentage sale mix much larger percentage slightly higher cost chilean brine one thing note price nearly many plant commissioning stage plant take couple year ramp fixed cost associated drag ramping plant upside benefit without capital investment going continue grow next couple year said mike earlier downside drag brings margin factor would lead u price said trough prior trough amid sort ebitda marginkevin mccarthy vertical research partner
