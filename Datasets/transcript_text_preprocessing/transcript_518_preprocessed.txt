implicationschristopher viehbacher president chief executive officer know marc know mean main benefit subcutaneous going convenience patient know talked earlier time looking ahead study could potentially one day get indication much earlierstage patient looking maintenance patient continue get approved prevent recurrence plaque know time drug expected expand study subcutaneous formulation stage disease could quite beneficial term actual competitiveness donanemab think going number point know know physician highly sensitive aria safety significantly better safety profile leqembi donanemab know interesting thing donanemab study know study actually followed patient decrease plaque clarity looked endpoint everybody time point month variable endpoint term time donanemab stopping criterion quite clear know think need see need pet scan instance know could quite onerous know whether going case think going number variable compete donanemab subcutaneous point helpful obviously know think lillys guidance look like donanemab case going market subcutaneous formulation going focused nonsubcutaneous factor competition know see label lilly see label subcu develop commercial

medicare time frame secondly update patient access neurologist thank youchristopher viehbacher president chief executive officer yeah get back heard anything medicare advantage different medicare ever asked question go check far know know bottleneck know still think data patient registry accurate direct access know suggests got almost twice many people registry treatment say addition bottleneck getting neurologist know get registry got know clear intent prescribe registry least cm describe actually validated diagnosis triaged patient done either pet scan csf marker looking reimbursement hearing little bit know challenge scheduling first mri initiate infusion first mri within first two week people want initiate infusion got mri scheduled know mri mri capacity constraint per se know looking specific date back infusion think people get hang getting coordination think seems one bottleneck ischuck triano head investor relation great thank chris let u move next question pleaseoperatorwell go next umer raffat evercore isiumer raffat evercore isi analyst hi guy thanks taking question thought would ask something little different today cd phase lupus question two thing

much taking question chris maybe walk rationale adding biogen resource leqembi launch maybe kind changed evolved partnership eisai think needed add biogen resource united state thank youchristopher viehbacher president chief executive officer yeah thanks evan mean clear adding biogen well eisai know year ago ceo eisai talked know launch leqembi yous discussed complexity launch necessarily bore everybody complexity felt wanted really make sure understood gotomarket model know addition neurology account specialist know got msls got patient care navigator got people looking kmes region probably every na another two three people actually field awful lot coordination needed even role na quite complex got go got work office around helping understand safety help understand care pathway help understand reimbursement leqembi know reimbursement pet scan mri care finally know people field principal objective leqembi wanted make sure understood honest whenever copromotions require awful lot coordination company felt would simpler one company went start sure knew exactly role na going work relation accompanying role field also needed get certain number core idns ready signed lot point increasing number people field unless got enough site activated ready know six month launch think feel comfortable role na work understand long take know going visit neurologist idn long going take activated say put awful lot resource able pull drug efficient process confident model obviously need reach site looking geographic expansion also think know even within certain geography perhaps reducing territory size know na go spend quite long time specialist always agreement two ceo scale biogen would come know objective make joint venture efficient possible felt efficiency start would maximized one company field obviously learned also give u confidence put two company field immediately japan example difference market number dynamic would pretty much market increase eisai increasing

highlighted importance exyous market could discus expected cadence trajectory skyclarys launch outside yous europe particular available major territory would expect uptake major territory fast united state thankschristopher viehbacher president chief executive officer two aspect guess launch one early access program formal launch example able launch germany approval formal launch still early access program patient convert commercial patient remembering actually patient early access program europe expected revenuegenerating part another program running france negotiating establishment early access program two european country early access program discussion country outside eu early access program important know europe getting pricing reimbursement take time little hard predict know understand cadence early access program would expect going quite fast yous said know suggestion patient warehousing effect could well europe said general matter time get reimbursement country fact going able early access program country slower uptake yous said also probably patient actually per caput remember disease related european descent incidence friedreichs ataxia slightly higher europe technical difficulty next big market opportunity would latin america submitting brazil perhaps priya give u update regulatory timeline therepriya singhal executive vice president head development yes comment fact really trying expedite regulatory filing latin america brazil argentina yet communicated timeline team working expeditiously meeting regulator really define pathway could provide earliest

return growth happening market right plan get back growth product thank youchristopher viehbacher president chief executive officer sure know oral therapy gene therapy spinraza intrathecal short term know think one data point important demonstrating efficacy spinraza following zolgensma feeling zolgensma wane time getting call switchbacks oral therapy sometimes appeared efficacy limited certain body weight actually go adult population believe patient sma actually treated clearly pediatric patient screened readily identified number adult patient disease manifest sometimes difficult diagnose back rare disease job hunting patient think actually appropriate patient appropriate treatment patient population one source growth longer term know highdose spinraza program development could successful lead one intrathecal injection per year would make enormous difference patient term patient convenience make spinraza even competitive compared others still going take number year expect still come market patent spinraza occursmike mcdonnell chief financial officer yeah quickly add mohit know mentioned prepared remark tends lumpiness quarter quarter particularly outside yous shipment overall look full year actually saw modest growth yous modest decline ous overall know moving back toward know modest growth trajectory hoping pleased franchise stabilized timechristopher viehbacher
