also maintain effort address regulatory requirement represent opportunity clear path adoption closing want emphasize facing challenge situation related equity capital market core business healthy reducing expense difficult important step addressing financing overhang continue mission transform way world see genome operator ready take question question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come sung ji nam scotiabank line opensung ji nam scotiabank analyst hi thanks taking question clarification start million revenue discontinued nextstep firststep fragile x coming service revenue segment would able kind comment kind growth rate business yearserik holmlin chief executive officer yes coming would service growing little bit expectation looking ahead making decision discontinue would mostly flatsung ji nam scotiabank analyst got ok erik great hear kind focus heme malignancy year could give u kind update term clinical study underway preclinical sorry prenatal postnatal team also solid tumor status kind next step themerik holmlin chief executive officer yeah sure know really made tremendous progress across area perhaps exception solid tumor although study irb approved really waiting know actually really bandwidth spend time particular study prenatal postnatal landmark publication came course year really demonstrating concordance traditional method beginning show incremental benefit diagnostic yield especially postnatal study know feel like created really solid momentum study going fine let sort know filter market people digest data know really large data set show value optical genome mapping replacement traditional method hematologic malignancy study also progressed significant publication including peerreviewed publication course focus going forward really continue pursue endpoint intend measure include incremental benefit optical genome mapping traditional method seen little bit early study early publication going continue dig deeply also want able show change case managed result information come study well variety health economic benefit know endpoint prenatal postnatal might little bit delayed get heme first think clinical trial program developed incredible momentum lot work continue independently know effort allow u focus resource hemesung ji nam scotiabank analyst got great super helpful last one gulsen could

third company essentially area company impacted one reason decided discontinue service product know fair number people associated generating revenue allows u meet part headcount target single move reason know important product flow sample coming door know provide benefit advancement ogm overall really core key driver think going forward really want deeply focused optical genome mapping management resource dedicated help number know order address know remaining know recognize gone significant product development via software market stratys system market incredible people helped u get point know need many going forward part transition know commercially impact across sale marketing way balancing really leverage know distribution partner third party support product market know really going lean going going deliver see maybe going ambitious know growing commercial footprint globally internationally across apac rest world maintain successful focus europe know united state canada know certainly going impact headcount want want keep momentum place built farmark massaro btig analyst ok maybe clarification install base guidance look like expecting range system year indicate expect conversion saphyr stratys right know math might let u see increase system overall delta midpoint would conversion mean based know math right based conversation customer maybe lastly talk mix capital reagent rental think might play yearerik holmlin chief executive officer sure yeah think sort math correct know feel feel confident know new installs know potential get past know know want make sure deliver signing conversion upgrade visibility think aside early access program day full commercial release stratys information getting fairly new upgrade estimate see thing play going

could talk little bit stratys placement know real action plan mentioned seven new customer walk u perhaps methodology thinking far customer wanting higher throughput system perhaps flavor far type account wereerik holmlin chief executive officer yeah know across board account think consistent pattern start emphasizing know either academic medical center like hospital know regional reference lab know commercial lab also system going pharmaceutical company see anymore think really important transition undergone see academic research center buying optical genome mapping create next reference genome specie specie little bit genetic genomic mechanistic work going know substantially adoption really target market routine use hematologic malignancy research constitutional genetic disease research application cell gene therapy know super pleased look stratys system folk raised hand without doubt see thing waiting provides new higher throughput also characteristic stratys system make attractive user include really lot flexibility coming introducing sample system generating data example stratys system run sample time also accommodate three additional sample know justintime sort fashion jump queue get ahead run know urgent sample flexibility workflow coupled higher throughput something lab finding know interesting attractive something else seeing know account pipeline process purchasing optical genome mapping making shift saphyr stratys know mark still also asked kind distribution rental capital purchase know seen rough distribution actually seeing little bit purchase stratys encouragingjeffrey cohen ladenburg thalmann analyst helpful finally u gulsen particular talk opex reduction quick math number le impairment leaning toward getting call fullyear could maybe comment perhaps give u little insight see breaking rd sgagulsen kama chief financial officer yeah term impact specifically annualized saving number announced take time implement saving initiative likely see partialyear impact result recent announcement one announced october full effect know number mentioned would least divide two guess term impact specifically sorry second part questionjeffrey
