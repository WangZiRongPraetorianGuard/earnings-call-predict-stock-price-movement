dingmann truist securitiesneal dingmann truist security analyst good morning congrats billy billy thanks help past first question today utica play specifically looking map slide appears continue target eastern side volatile window wondering could talk thought maybe prospectivity black oil window anything might see year might cause change activity play remainder yearkeith trasko senior vice president exploration production yes keith right delineating mainly north south valid oil trend mile area first thing need kind west need acquire seismic data process need see degree structural complexity kind start developing geologically general see significant change thickness pay east west west going little bit lower maturity would equate le pressure play eagle ford le pressure reduces well productivity maybe little bit also reduces cost economics still really comparable portion play overall activity level asked ramped one full rig year want able grow pace leverage learning continue get better also drive cost need keep getting infrastructure place basin like inbasin sand water reuse sticking plan laid last quarter net well little early disclose anything overall play really competes best place capital great thing multibasin portfolio necessarily need ramp aggressively kind let return drive thatneal dingmann truist security analyst good detail keith second quickly look

delineation phase drilled initial well seen encouraged initial well result continuing test see going clear hurdle rate talked big thing would say day exploration play initial well think highlighted yous way operate exploration much data really drilling initial well see actually produce oil natural gas like testing whether rock productive could end dry hole day really get oil gas surface expected going economic way really competes existing portfolio exploring found something really command investment taking rig another play hand annann janssen executive vice president chief financial officer

kind board demand lot better later decade wanted maybe focus little bit kind next year soezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yes leo ezra know would call bullish would say constructive said seen surprising upside amount natural gas demand power generation last couple summer continue think going true summer big part coupled coal retirement also think pull natural gas summer pricing soft also continue great well combine reduction rig activity past eight month fact operator also starting curtail volume think going bring supply side point could actually make pretty good progress inventory level back half year little bit feed gas starting taken lng give u little bit confidence headed right quite bit overhang right need see come starting summeroperatorthank next question paul cheng scotiabankpaul cheng scotiabank analyst thank good morning also apologize want go back utica looking well cost well productivity kind improvement need order move peso inaudible elimination inaudible manufacturing production development also based see inventory backlog one feel comfortable delineation development program look like whether number rig crew number well expect going come per year basis first questionkeith trasko senior vice president exploration production yes paul keith start well cost still early play team continues drive cost see lot room efficiency consistent activity year one full rig helped lot like generally area easier operating environment compared lot play consistent geology little bit shallower depth example mile lateral drilled sable also brought efrac crew higher pump rate increased efficiency overall see development cost someday getting little bit lower permian even per foot great thing play opportunity benefit learning play eog best practice well performance side really happy well ezra kind already touched see compete best player america comparable permian production per foot basis oil equivalent really highlighting differentiated organic exploration strategy development program far rig crew number well go back growing pace still learn demote basin portfolio necessarily ramp aggressivelypaul cheng scotiabank analyst see ask second question also want add congratulation best wish billy thank help past several year second question think ann year million strategic infrastructure spending assume every year throughout cycle always going strategic infrastructure spending suppose reasonable add based cycle assumption strategic infrastructure spending also add overall spending level infrastructure dc guysezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yes paul ezra yes million infrastructure strategic infrastructure highlighted could excited longterm margin expansion benefit jeff highlighted opening remark project historically look opportunity like rare present take infrastructure project generate compelling rate return talked verde pipeline expected generate rate return uplift top get gpt saving netback uplift per mcf life asset similarly janus gas processing plant permian basin one also roughly anticipated rate return one gpt saving net back uplift mcf could continue find project strong return profile much value

end enough margin see opportunity go ahead capture value shareholdersoperatorthank next question come derrick whitfield stifelderrick whitfield stifel financial corp analyst good morning would like extend congrats billy well leaning utica sound like southern part trend could advantaged return based elevated nris potential geology could perhaps expand difference seeing geology north southkeith trasko senior vice president exploration production yes keith yes still early play learning every day geology tie production going obviously vary net acre general utica thicker north south little bit better pay better geomechanics rock property frac barrier keeping frac energy contained near wellbore expect gather data different area going different type curve geology also going drive spacing real happy rail result area exceeding expectation generating great return happy far white rhino south still cleaning gone couple week seeing little liquid yield compared timberwolf xavier right mineral benefit able update little production dataderrick whitfield stifel financial corp analyst great bigger picture question prb niobrara assuming dc optimization efficiency based progress date could play compete delaware eagle ford time returnsjeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yes derrick jeff yes made lot really good stride prb started really focusing deeper inaudible really refine geologic model kind throughout whole section good success inaudible went package development last year saw package development really good uptick overall productivity inaudible accumulate enough data went ahead moving section package development niobrara really started drilling well year really good success operationally look bringing later year comparison powder permian mean many basin going like permian far overall productivity result little bit different advantage got really low fd cost lot scale obviously got close acre really focused south powder portion got lot expansion take learning move north powder delineation well across acreage aspect excited moving fast maybe permian basin making really really good stride return look great team continuing make really good improvement operational aspect seeing premium return playoperatorthank next question nitin kumar mizuho securitiesnitin kumar mizuho security analyst hey guy congrats bill retirement thanks help year start peer talked refrac recomplete activity eagle ford obviously long history basin obviously leading technology want ask thought around refracs could compete new player like utica others

david jeff early inning say operationally utica set mean almost perfectly efficiency gain able see getting better every well keith talked opening statement drilled longest lateral date mile program right consistently three mile team plan continuing push one run lateral stay bottom longer trip hole really problem operationally completing well think play looking forward far longer lateral yes continue push limit got lot driver cost per foot metric looking movement able lower cost would expect continue operational success drilling longer longer uticadavid deckelbaum td cowen analyst appreciate final question think incremental hundred million spent year strategic infrastructure project along infrastructure side think sort forward capital intensity infrastructure continue developing beyond number increase intensity every year given infrastructure call currently sort feel like steady run rate percentage basisezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yes david ezra
