everybody maybe start new project capex update mackie team clearly busy last quarter addition curious given sort higher end range billion point year anything could sort tip u hopper contemplating new range thinking project like blue marlin warrior gulf run expansion anything kind point get u mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer yeah spiro mackie everything right going next day may make significant progress thing working thing announced recently additional million thing approved recently kicked several actually come online later year come online kind within two year earlier yeah adding capital also going see revenue much quicker course lot project spiro dounis citi analyst got helpful want go slide one sort point new opportunity evaluating power plant side connect new existing power plant curious could expand could mean term scope sort interstate pipeline expansion also talking brownfield even greenfield storage expansion tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah tell kind first small step u everybody aware certainly texas throughout many state grid jeopardy cold hot weather help support really driver behind adding megawatt facility number one reliability make sure glitch grid especially west texas uncommon keep facility running addition also help grid security example able kind uritype cold weathertype circumstance erca asks u get grid able get grid keep plant running reliably allow excess energy going grid benefit producer example upstream might issue losing electricity think kind small step grow help make system asset much reliable grid stable addition go great detail also lot revenue benefit lar ancillary service able provide added generation pretty excited kind small stuff right make lot sense partnership spiro dounis citi analyst great leave today thank gentleman operatorour next question come keith stanley wolfe research please go ahead keith stanley wolfe research analyst hi good afternoon wanted go back intrastate gas sale strong result detail give optimization opportunity saw drove million gain relatedly update much capacity available benefit permian differential year anything warrior project well thanks tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer ok let start end warrior continue team continues work one thing going disciplined prudent going run announce project unless feel good capacity sold long term going run fid warrior capacity existing system still terming working hard pause lng impacted little bit bigger customer working however remains everybody call probably know strong interest another pipeline probably mid late optimistic next pipeline come west texas continue work hard get finish line make sense far spread across texas kind varies month month certainly north mcf day available benefiting wide spread sure hate see price waha happens capacity constraint right permian pipeline coming later year alleviate lot certainly way positioned well take advantage type spread customer benefit well benefit far intrastate revenue built feel extremely fortunate asset throughout yous especially texas team operating asset really cold weather time really volatile time even really hot weather ability create lot revenue peak hourly sale putting storage position moving gas west east even backhaul lot thing massive intrastate pipeline network texas see every year see winter many time summer able capture kind unexpected revenue always volatile time level keith stanley wolfe research analyst appreciate detailed answer second question thinking thing thinking lens energy transfer obviously sun well know independent company fair amount overlap asset business mix et sun think going forward kind type acquisition asset make sense et level versus sun level differentiation tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah listen obviously good question spent lot time within energy transfer strategizing think start saying still feel like consolidation make sense midstream space foot answer question still fully intend evaluating various opportunity look going slow front far look going always trying look thing feed way downstream always like talk go wellhead water across commodity see strategy look stuff asset look feed way value chain make acquisition give u great opportunity commercial synergy well cost synergy guess last part question energy transfer versus sunoco clearly sunoco team done fantastic job nustar could excited asset base coming family see see kind wholesale fuel distribution terminal business etc right going overlap instance look way combined basis sunoco going continue make kind acquisition really first big public company transaction made lot asset acquisition clearly something accretive good family standpoint going look across table mackie give chance add little bit even latest nustar acquisition optimization might looking mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer bet yeah want elaborate much sun said anybody follows kind explain excited kind stepping kind growing little bit one regard far different type asset asset overlap think real benefit potentially partnering discussion possibly opportunity arise beneficial accretive partnership jv look forward catching opportunity time move forward keith stanley wolfe research analyst thank mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer answer question keith stanley wolfe research analyst sure thanks mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer ok operatorour next question come manav gupta ubs please go ahead manav gupta ubs analyst hi quick question relates slide look capex ngl refined product midstream know still early crystal ball look believe mix could change significantly next year segment could get capex view helpful thank tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah start guess looking right nothing jump would change significantly however walk hypothetical let u think say everything pause get lifted example lng intend maybe could start earlier probably likely kind depends warrior pick later year sooner later lot different variable negotiation going even permitting issue government think highlevel answer kind spin rate right least pretty consistent got number project alluded different segment might begin quicker others would course skew one way manav gupta ubs analyst thank quick followup marcus hook think last quarter tom spoke construction first phase optimizing precision project could add ethane refrigeration storage capacity update one thank tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer update excited phase diligently moving phase adding ethane storage excited future export facility capability revenue market many year come manav gupta ubs analyst thanks taking questionsoperatorour next question come michael blum well fargo please go ahead michael blum well fargo security analyst thanks good afternoon everyone wanted ask go back eight megawatt gasfired power plant announced texas clarify basically peaker plant going supply gas think return invested capital investment like mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer hey michael mackie yeah provide natural gas facility mentioned two main driver reliability number one asset keep plant running keep gas flowing number two benefit grid economics expect necessarily run lot almost hour year run economics running think significantly lower run meet rate return hurdle anomaly regard like uritype situation kind cold weather kind huge runup power price benefit ancillary service lar thing like like said putting try create significant return likely could create lot better return projecting really building reliability asset grid michael blum well fargo security analyst ok got thank followup warrior potential project clarify want service need get fid mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer pretty quick probably typically say typically lot change last three four year able get fid hypothetically example late third quarter early fourth quarter believe end latest michael blum well fargo security analyst great thank operatorour next question come theresa chen barclays please go ahead theresa chen barclays analyst good afternoon followup question related topic related comment wanting wellheadtowater strategy pro forma nustar asset family expansive crude oil system permian cushing permian nederland sizable corpus christi export facility longhaul movement permian corpus christi natural area might want fill portfolio tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer sure mean anywhere connect dot producer want go best market want market certainly year focused bringing many barrel possible bakken midland cushing midland houston asset benefit well downstream pipe bayou bridge vlcc project certainly asset sale move crude example midland corpus always look remember nustar asset one chasing opportunity wherever might fit might make sense want talk u certainly open probably better nustar question related corpus theresa chen barclays analyst got looking dakota access recontracting outlook way bayou bridge taking account tmx online shipping wcs west also syncrude seemingly indirectly compressed bakken dip given connection mainline outlook dapl recontracting coming couple year balanced incremental barrel getting crestwood tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah love bakken love done proud role played get barrel great basin refinery midwest gulf coast great asset u funny year time recontracting concern different asset one think long term blip time time think long term premier optimum outlet producer best way get production mentioned patoka many midcontinent refinery well refinery around port arthur houston course bayou bridge way lake charles st james refinery add vlcc project asset really concerned company willing roll long period time period time make sense u may go yearly time lot concern think basin going stable next year see massive growth long oil price remain fairly strong see like mentioned stable kind consistent flow believe best option producer engage anybody want roll course already talking certainly something would sleep theresa chen barclays analyst thank much operatorour next question come john mackay goldman sachs please go ahead john mackay goldman sachs analyst hey thanks time afternoon maybe take one power plant side yeah guess curious guy operating small plant past think potential capacity adding guess relatively small versus et probably consumes overall think room guy expand number time think maybe kind first look kind set project tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah john fact thought said earlier probably make clear enough yes first step grid problem country texas exception lot people moving texas lot data center lot ai data center crypto miner still coming industrial growth mean optimistic natural gasfired generation something continue look highly unlikely announce quarter go operator mentioned earlier peaking unit unit good heat rate efficient provide wellpriced megawatt cost run kind first step excited may take u especially area example maybe mont belvieu think real opportunity bigger cryo complex well around state area continue grow john mackay goldman sachs analyst appreciate detail maybe zooming moving little bit spend minute maybe talking blue ammonia hub maybe kind role could look like kind piece value chain would want versus maybe partner come kind run tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer yeah keep talking excited fossil fuel business especially natural gas incremental many thing certainly ammonia production right probably little bit higher priority little bit focus lake charles area got lot momentum significant player really know approaching similar lng project potential petchem want big owner ammonia want operate yes retain ownership level likely possible really drive u give example one ammonia plant deliver approximately mcf day lake charles looking anywhere maybe five seven certain period time insignificant natural gas transportation revenue addition storage revenue terminal revenue able load lake charles see enormous growth ammonia everybody probably know fertilizer feed people world going nothing grow depending expert next year got power side fuel side ship built burn ammonia fuel got bunkering ammonia got south korea japan place ammonia going blended coal fuel big another big plus nustar ammonia pipeline bought see big future ammonia interesting peak standpoint said really help facilitate natural gas transportation business well excited headed thing hope well nederland john mackay goldman sachs analyst appreciate detail thank operatorour next question come elvira scotto rbc capital market please go ahead elvira scotto rbc capital market analyst hey good afternoon everyone talk little bit seeing producer activity haynesville look like decline system also seeing relative embedded original expectation guidance see activity trending rest year mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer yeah mackie certainly lean play throughout yous marcellus utica northeast part oklahoma panhandle texas east texas certainly haynesville seen slowdown andor buts price fall henry hub put lot pressure producer yes seen fall fairly significantly northern haynesville interstate group though get shoutout volume grew yes got aggressive margin tightened good job inter intrastates north louisiana yeah far gp business seen fall however look kind happening saw peak six month ago lng export almost bcf around bcf another lng facility coming believe june july see growth start seeing demand like believe overseas europe elsewhere heat pick summer see demand jump bcf overnight see decline haynesville area going able ramp quickly see pricing rest year think getting high end year think possibly could moved could see higher price mid latter part summer hot summer lng demand really pick like think yes doubt tougher quarter lean area haynesville one elvira scotto rbc capital market analyst ok great super helpful going back slide comment made eight megawatt gasfired electric generation facility also talked kind data center curious conversation data center maybe utility regarding incremental capacity potential expansion opportunity think part equation longer term mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer yes viva conversation anybody want gas system quick little story two three year ago started strategy agenda anything within mile intra interstate pipeline need go connect lot focused power plant team vicky team done excellent job connecting plant extending agreement power plant also roll lot opportunity looking laying pipeline large chip manufacturer texas well believer like everybody else data center especially around ai going happen whether mean next five eight year going grow bcf demand gasgenerated electricity bcf know know going combination population growth mentioned earlier industry growth ammonia growth ai data center etc power plant growth talking probably seven eight different power plant least fairly significant natural gasfired generation expansion texas handful oklahoma well common theme tom keep talking call demand natural gas going nothing go many year come excited asset believe benefit opportunity elvira scotto rbc capital market analyst great hear thank much operatorour next question come zack van everen tudor pickering holt co please go ahead zack van everen tudor pickering holt company analyst perfect thanks taking question guy maybe circling back last one data center side know guy probably one larger intrastate footprint permian call dallas seen lot development talk development data center area curious ability expand intrastate pipe maybe feed power demand whether dallas houston state mackie mccrea cochief executive officer chief commercial officer well kind coincides little bit said really made job go connect every possible gasgenerating power plant every state operate certainly done tremendous capability texas already connected approximately power plant texas either directly indirectly strategically located storage facility north texas near dallas also near baml lot ai unlike crypto miner lot time making lot money selling electricity running computer ai think everybody know got reliable rely renewables yes needed add additional power plant provide electricity help meet demand dallas fort area including ai expansion certainly part look asset mean nobody mentioned even close able find service especially type market zack van everen tudor pickering holt company analyst perfect make sense maybe switching blue marlin guy able get favorable eis study well permit time frame would commercially operation tom long cochief executive officer chief financial officer guess would say like believe receive draft eis hopeful confident within year get permit license making certain assumption thing might happen november certainly great thing project unlike competitor brownfield project pipe already lot already ground sea huge advantage pretty good deal cost competitor think significantly le kind unique ability move barrel different basin competitor feed project optimistic anyway finish answer question say hypothetically second third quarter next year ready go believe looking two half three year yeah two half three year would actually go service zack van everen tudor pickering holt company analyst perfect thank much operatorthis concludes questionandanswer session
