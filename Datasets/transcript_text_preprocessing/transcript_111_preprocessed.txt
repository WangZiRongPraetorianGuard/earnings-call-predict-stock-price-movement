put gpus computer next lot camera guess computing power available really change product road map folksrob willett president chief executive officer yes thanks jake question start longerterm view deep learning technology kind something around long time think really began see work geoffrey hinton starting make really workable saw started useable machine vision factory automation later decade acquired vidi sualab credit cognex seeing trend early leading application deep learning technology move generative ai leader space applies factory automation really see really encourage come website look insight l vision system taking powerful technology making really easy use putting point cloud environment vision historically vision really add extra dimension really exponential amount data one manage quite computer intensive question kind chip changed well one thing one work ai applies model used difficult computerintensive slow manage cloud capability gpus able use train manage huge data set quickly effectively reality factory automation really happening edge right take powerful technology put pretty small form factor apply right point manufacture right line something cognex extremely good making processor run efficiently case taken deep learning technology developed something called edge learning pretrains model applies edgebased device efficient way chip get faster able bring technology right edge make work effectively kind process going really making product much easier use easier sell broaden application used really really managed effectively human change going really powerful chip think perhaps referring still going cloud coming edge next year would say know moore law everything chip become powerful smaller think create lot opportunity see powerful machine vision
