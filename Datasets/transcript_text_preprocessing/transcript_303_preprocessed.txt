design win pipeline customer engagementshock tan president chief executive officer indicated really say count anybody go production rail customer pointharlan sur jpmorgan chase company analyst ok thanks hockhock tan president chief executive officer thanksoperatorplease stand next question next question come line vivek arya bank america security line openvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thank taking question billion ai still supply constrained number think kind projectdriven number really supply get get let u say increase supply could upside kind part b switching side already started see benefit terabit per second switch something come along later like contribution switching upside mentioned yearhock tan president chief executive officer yeah tomahawk going great gun driven unlike past tomawak tomawak traditional scaleout hyperscalers cloud environment largely coming scaling ai data center building larger larger cluster enable generative ai computing functionality going bigger bigger pipe hence tomahawk terabit perfect solution seeing lot demand many case basically surpassing rate adoption previously thought good solution connecting gpus respect ai accelerator think focusing constraint supply chain get enough lead time hyperscale customer supply chain constraintvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thank youoperatorplease stand next question next question come line stacy rasgon bernstein research line openstacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst hi guy thanks taking question question core software business said vmware two month billion would put rest software ca symantec brocade like two half almost could like sequentially almost year year guess math right like going core business thinking growth core business vmware go year vmware still billion think thathock tan president chief executive officer yeah get excited think certain product contract obtained strong contract renewal older old broadcom contract especially mainframe strong distributor software platform also accelerated star show stacy star show accelerating booking backlog accumulating vmwarestacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst ok vmware still running like billion billion run rate benefit sound like accelerate overall vmware billion talked core business strength quarter kind onetime could model kind like falling shown overall software hock tan president chief executive officer correctstacy rasgon alliancebernstein analyst got ok thank youhock tan president chief executive officer thanksoperatorplease stand next question next question come line aaron rakers well fargo line openaaron rakers well fargo security analyst yeah thanks taking question wanted ask kind continuing vmware discussion little bit hock asset little curious gotomarket strategy look vmware relative prior software acquisition done really getting kind like kind thought segmentation customer base vmware know discussion around channel engagement legacy vmware channel past kind curious managing gotomarkethock tan president chief executive officer think long honest like three month three month yes seems thing work thing seem progressing well hoped would focusing gotomarket go market focusing resource go market engineering improved vcf stack selling able support process help customer deploy start really make stand data center focus largest would say strategic customer guy want still significant distributed data center onprem many customer looking hybrid situation trying use word loosely basically lot customer legacy critical mainframe old platform growing except still vital modernizing workload cut today future really choice taking angle running lot application data center onprem distributed data center onprem handle modernized workload time elastic demand able also put application public cloud today environment customer onprem data center resembles cloud high availability low latency highly resilient one offering vmware cloud foundation vcf exactly replicate get public cloud love three month seeing level booking generating last three monthsaaron rakers well fargo security analyst thank youoperatorplease stand next question next question come line chris danely citi line openchris danely citi analyst hey thanks letting ask question question ai upside term customer perspective much upside coming new versus existing customer see customer base going forward think going broaden know like price get bunch new customer product could better pricing better margin well hopefully listening callhock tan president chief executive officer chris thanks question love perhaps let try perhaps give sense think ai market new generative ai market speak using loosely generically well really see two broad segment one segment hyperscalers especially large hyperscalers huge huge consumer subscriber base probably guess people large subscriber base almost infinite amount data model getting subscriber keep using platform able generate better experience subscriber better advertising opportunity advertising client great roi seeing roi come quickly investment continues vigorously segment comprising player choose subscriber base scale invest lot asics custom silicon custom ai accelerator make plenty sense focus attention also buy scalar ai accelerator increasing large cluster way model running foundation model run large language model need generate parameter buy lot networking together comparison obviously value ai accelerator sell network working side growing small percentage compared size value accelerator one big segment segment smaller enterprise broadly call enterprise segment ai talking company large large large want ai initiative going big news hype ai savior productivity get company multiple initiative short going public cloud trying run onprem try run onprem take standard silicon ai accelerator much possible term ai accelerator market merchant silicon market networking side tie together data center buy networking component beginning switch router even people like arista switch sure various component mentioned different sense market interesting mix see bothchris danely citi analyst well thanks lotoperatorplease stand next question next question come line karl ackerman bnp paribas line openkarl ackerman exane bnp paribas analyst yes thank hock weakness broadband server storage customer understandable given peer said earnings season perhaps could speak backlog visibility customer market would indicate market could begin order see sequential growth second half calendar year thank youhock tan president chief executive officer correct say almost like near trough year first half sure trough second half know yet tell week lead time know disciplined sticking based seeing booking lately significantly booking year ago karl ackerman exane bnp paribas analyst thank youoperatorplease stand next question next question come line christopher rolland susquehanna line openchris rolland susquehanna international group analyst thanks question hock one optical check suggest vertically integrating putting driver tia starting get traction pam dsp think kind early lead gig data center laser well lot back ai networking appears exploding wondering could help u size market also talk fast growing think may clue onethird number ai gave u perhaps kind doubleclick square u would great thankshock tan president chief executive officer ok get carried away please category outside ai accelerator thing like pam dsps optical component retirement small compared tomahawk switch jericho router using ai network also environment know traditional enterprise networking kind also bit slowdown always think demand driven much ai tends push u line thinking could biased showing mix content networking relative compute skewed different ai data center compared traditional cpubased data center want get guy wrong way right ai data center lot quite bit content dsps pams optical component retirement pci express switch still big overall scheme thing compared sell switch router compared ai accelerator even small think ratio said ai revenue billionplus year would ai accelerator everything else within everything else would say half like switch router rest various retirement dsp component unlike said vertically integrated sense entire transceiver optical transceiver manufactured typically oem contract manufacturer like online inaudible guy china guy much competitive provide key component talk look way understand kind weighting various valueschris rolland susquehanna international group analyst super helpful thank hockoperatorplease stand next question next question come line toshiya hari goldman sachs line opentoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst hi thank taking question hock think appreciate capability term custom compute asked question last quarter group call back one competitor based asia continues pretty vocal adamant one future design largest customer may share picking conflicting evidence getting bunch investor question hoping could address confidence level sort maintaining extending position thank youhock tan president chief executive officer stop somebody trashtalking ok best way describe let number speak please leave way add like thing term large critical technology product tend always deep strategic multiyear relationship customertoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst understood thank youoperatorplease stand next question next question come line vijay rakesh mizuho line openvijay rakesh mizuho security analyst yeah hi custom silicon side obviously guy dominate space mentioned two customer two major customer wondering really holding back hyperscalers ramping custom silicon side flip side hearing peer talk custom silicon road map well could hit thankshock tan president chief executive officer well number one dominate market two dominating number one number two second point take year take lot heavy lifting create custom silicon need hardware silicon really solution generative ai even ai trying create ai capability data center silicon invest lot creating software model work custom silicon match got match business model first place lead create foundation model need work optimize custom silicon developing iterative process constant evolving process even customer deal mentioned last call take year really understand able basically reach point say hey finally delivering production worthy silicon bad work well foundation model customer put place software layer work firmware software layer translates work almost like creating entire ecosystem limited basis recognized well x cpu gpus kind ai accelerator something still early stage take year two customer engaged year one engaged eight year get point something patient persevere hope everything line ultimate success silicon developer dependent dependent much even partner customer got patient guy got two farvijay rakesh mizuho security analyst peer getting markethock tan president chief executive officer getting market please repeatvijay rakesh mizuho security analyst talked peer like think nvidia talking entering custom silicon market thought around yeahhock tan president chief executive officer comment made say interest going market philosophy running business broadcom maybe people different philosophy let tell simple philosophy articulated time every clear management team whole broadcom good keep doubling thing know better anybody else keep doubling nobody else catch keep running pack something think somebody else much better job philosophyvijay rakesh mizuho security analyst great thanksoperatorplease stand next question next question come line matt ramsay td cowen line openmatt ramsay td cowen analyst thank much squeezing guy kind twopart thing custom silicon stuff guess hock merchant leader ai interested custom networking stuff either switching routing would consider second question kirsten business model around custom silicon folk taking epayments upfront sell end product lower gross margin higher operating margin guy wrapped massive custom business real impact gross margin maybe could unpack philosophy accounting way guy approach custom silicon opportunity margin perspective thanks guyshock tan president chief executive officer take asking business model asking really number crunching let try answer way particular reason shot constitutes ai accelerator ai accelerator way configured whether merchant customer ai accelerator run foundation model well whole bunch load floatingpoint multiplier matrix multiplication matrix analysis regression logic part compute part come come access lot memory literally almost cash memory tied chip simple multiplier come attached memory almost layer threedimensional chip memory something u ai accelerator super good designing building buy memory specialized highbandwidth memory know key memory supplier every one u parted combine two together ai accelerator even get good net corporate silicon gross margin mine compute logic chip multiplier way apply kind addon margin highbandwidth memory big part cost total chip naturally simple math hold entire consolidated ai accelerator brings gross margin traditional silicon product going away adding memory even though create excess io attach could justify adding kind margin memory nobody could u brings natural lower margin really simple basis logic part sure kind content kind ip develop cutting edge make highdensity floatingpoint multiplier square millimeter advanced silicon command margin similar corporate gross marginmatt ramsay td cowen analyst ok thank operatorplease stand next question next question come line edward snyder charter equity research line openedward snyder charter equity research analyst thanks lot first housekeeping one could hock mentioned second customer customer also mentioned take year work iteratively mean anybody looked tpu history guess understands said take time ramp maybe could give u little bit color phenomenal growth custom silicon product much material part coming second customer taking account low revenue number growth rate generally speaking fairly comparable question vmwarehock tan president chief executive officer better go vmware customer first tell customer individually sorryedward snyder charter equity research analyst ok ok never mind waste time closing vmware held kind significant shift software strategy focus largest customer hundred thousand expect get say lowhanging fruit selling like mentioned first customer vcf product opex share sale firstly sale marketing would start increase big leverage broadcom almost acquisition software seems changing nowhock tan president chief executive officer shift interesting right got spending gotomarket support lot customer vmware stratify strategic guy sell upsell vc private cloud good long tail call smaller commercial customer continue support sell improved version vsphere compute virtualization improve productivity service attempt say go build whole vcm skill scale add right cost spend opex spend support service gotomarket increase difference say ca mai acquisition growing business fast increase spend growing business operating leverage revenue growth next three yearsedward snyder charter equity research analyst great could squeeze one would mentioned several time actually last quarter two division going divest including carbon black changed changed market outlook kind softened wait see change strategy going integrate curious last quarter said probably get rid month keeping ithock tan president chief executive officer well find could generate value shareholder assume kidding would generate value shareholder taking carbon black big integrating cement would
