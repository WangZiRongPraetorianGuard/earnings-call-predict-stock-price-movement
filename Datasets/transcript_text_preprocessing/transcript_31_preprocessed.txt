thatreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes thanks alex great question couple highlight around asco first really honor asco actually invited present update p wildtype subgroup followon asco plenary last year think resonated lot kols asco really wanted u perform update p wildtype subgroup upcoming asco going use opportunity really update efficacy well safety provide new analysis think highlight potential benefit risk see selinexor novel population p wildtype endometrial cancer go detail really looking forward opportunity want thank vicky makker msk presenting behalf investigator term second question really main difference trial relative siendo going patient population siendo enrolled allcomers population patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer potentially eligible randomized current trial focusing patient p wild type evaluated ng testing partner foundation medicine key difference necessarily related patient population important difference dose siendo treated everybody dose selinexor milligram weekly current trial going milligram weekly two main difference would highlight across two trialsrichard paulson president chief executive officer thanks alexoperatorthank next question come line maury raycroft jefferies please go aheadmaury raycroft jefferies analyst hi good morning thanks taking question going ask couple specific upcoming data asco late last year guy presented initial o data igcs conference also last cut medium pfs pmmr group amateur data asco couple week say going update pfs pmmr group also o study yes maybe start questionreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes thanks maury really appreciate question point provide additional detail term exact analysis going present keep mind going opportunity present update efficacy pfs new analysis right provide additional color benefit risk come next week really excited able provide updatemaury raycroft jefferies analyst got helpful speak doctor doctor want see o landmark o want achieve study also talk driver o focused siendoreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes trial powered detect meaningful statistical difference term pfs progressionfree survival similar siendo trial similar endpoint dostarlimab approved combination chemotherapy followed dostarlimab maintenance specifically mmr patient population focus much going pfs said o key secondary endpoint goal really show detriment time primary cutoff define detriment specifically hazard ratio le one term actual median overall survival think going take time mature patient living longer longer continue follow overall survival data matures ongoing trial able provide additional data future future updatesmaury raycroft jefferies analyst ok clarify benchmark sort landmark siendo o want achieve doctor would want see studyreshma rangwala chief medical officer time think much evolving point landmark able provide think focus much detriment mentioned earliermaury raycroft jefferies analyst got ok maybe one last question hop back queue said could myelofibrosis phase data update year could look like venue would make sense updatereshma rangwala chief medical officer yes think focus really going century trial century new acronym trial trial alluded jpmorgan selinexor monotherapy trial evaluating jaknaive patient population going focus year anticipate able provide initial preliminary data efficacy well safety perspective sometime said phase selinexor ruxolitinib trial still ongoing well able provide additional update efficacy safety perspective later year wellmaury raycroft jefferies analyst okay great thanks taking questionsreshma rangwala chief medical officer thanks mauryoperatorand next question come colleen kusy baird please go aheadcolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst great good morning thanks taking question congrats refinancing one endometrial phase expect enrollment phase split among pmmr dmmr patient characteristic stratifying would include mmr status followupreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes great question thank colleen look endometrial cancer patient population specifically mmr vast majority patient going pmmr comprise approximately patient look remaining population going dmmr patient population look p subpopulation breakdown going similar within p wall type subgroup anticipate proportion patient mmr enrolled trial would assume somewhere le maybe similar seeing natural populationcolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst something stratifying item start think phase enrollmentreshma rangwala chief medical officer stratifying yes thank followup stratifying based upon mmr status assume majority patient going pmmr assume going similar split across two arm selinexor placebo stratifyingcolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst understood helpful myelofibrosis know ongoing phase coprimary endpoint svr tss curious recent interaction fda kind role tss specifically kind thinking approval endpoint myelofibrosisreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes comment specific fda interaction said think myelofibrosis space focus always continues two main endpoint going svr well tss analysis precedent always much focused end point encouraged phase data really suggests combination selinexor plus ruxolitinib maximize benefit see across two endpoint continues remain add additional dor data really demonstrates patient achieve svr tss remain response really encouraged compilation data think provides confidence potential outcome phase trialcolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst great one commercial question sohanya pre post tcell therapy setting speak type duration treatment seeing patient population versus see average second thirdline setting second fourthsohanya cheng chief commercial officer yes absolutely several way selinexor used pre post well per tcell therapy pre stage used shorter bridge could one cycle used unique line therapy preceding tcell therapy could several month long look different put take duration therapy couple key driver one new patient start volume right higher new patient start higher refill good news q saw really nice growth versus prior quarter new patient start academic setting well community setting second area around duration therapy long patient stay therapy really driven couple different factor one line therapy early aligns patient stay therapy longer typically community well got offset balance academic setting see bridge goal balancing shorter duration bridge academic setting continue drive new patient volume pre post tcell therapy spacecolleen kusy robert w baird company analyst great thanks taking questionsreshma rangwala chief medical officer thanks colleenoperatorand next question come line brian abraham rbc capital market please go aheadbrian abraham rbc capital market analyst hi good morning thanks taking question two guess first endometrial phase understand majority patient likely pmmr guess curious light maturing data longer capital runway whether updated thought

wondering still eliminated wellrichard paulson president chief executive officer thanks brian maybe turn reshma going talk first part mike talk second partreshma rangwala chief medical officer yes thanks brian great question one reason focusing pmmr well dmmr patient population look hazard ratio across two subgroup show meaningful benefit pmmr p wildtype subgroup seeing impressive hazard ratio look mmr patient population also seeing strong approximately hazard ratio benefit really seen regardless mmr status really suggests least key biomarker driving predicting benefit going p status right really want leverage p status determine patient population based upon unique biomarker able ultimately drive use across broad populationrichard paulson president chief executive officer yes second part look updated agreement turn mike touch pointmichael mason chief financial officer sure brian especially think referring amended agreement hcr still stay consistent case get return capped time
