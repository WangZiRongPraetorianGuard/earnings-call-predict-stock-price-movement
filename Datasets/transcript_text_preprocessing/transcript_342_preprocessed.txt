fourthquarter guidancefranc brisebois oppenheimer company analyst ok commercial side spravato infrastructure obviously read remind maybe u listener spravato work many time people come efficiency maybe center would put situation might superior spravato learning evolved guy look commercial opportunitykabir nath chief executive officer great question yes clearly protocol spravato different envisage final protocol comp reminder spravato label actually requires eight administration first month four second month maintenance thereafter patient physician discretion typically every couple week imagine therefore course first three month something like session requires patient clinic minimum really three four hour given intranasal administration two hour monitoring way drive home afterwards actually requires caregiver well contrast obviously yet know durability shall say typical patient comp phase designed ready address said based know perhaps might two four administration year patient see patient perspective different centertocenter difference using one room day every perhaps three four month actually multiple us room course time inaudible believe yet big part reason signed collaboration entity greenbrook hackensack exactly understand going integrate psilocybin differentially spravato workflow think address inaudiblefranc brisebois oppenheimer company analyst great thank

power placebo response unchanged well delay think overcome factor contributed nowkabir nath chief executive officer second part question ritu well aware blinded trial part b week therefore determining able announce top line something matter review timeritu baral td cowen analyst got followup question mentioned multiple delivery template speak collaboration greenbrook hackensack mentioned working option sort bucket different template particular aspect delivery guess building investigating two sort like large different phenotype delivery model thinking pointkabir nath chief executive officer great question would say work precisely understand many different phenotype delivery shall say going need take first two obviously greenbrook hackensack different greenbrook full profit network interventional psychiatry center essentially today offering tm ketamine spravato interested offering psychedelics well kind recently grasped would say traditional psychiatric treatment therefore fit already physical infrastructure delivery thing working work context may different someone like hackensack integrated regional health system multiple site currently different specialism also large kind tertiary care center bed probably going heart treat psychedelics think reason reason see couple collaboration different setting care exactly learn sort different delivery model required would extend also reimbursement mean instance imagine commercial center might open buy bill actually fit well economics offer attractive route health system much likely part b rather part b question want answerritu baral td cowen analyst got collaboration going represent type setting significant use yous eu way think individual collaborationskabir nath chief executive officer way think deliberate know
