call operator open question operator please question answer operatoroperator instruction move first andrew percoco morgan stanley line open andrew percoco morgan stanley analyst great thanks much taking question guess start margin guidance obviously lot unpack look first quarter revenue actually somewhat line guidance margin missed understanding mostly related mix shift guess lack reversal mix shift expecting following fourth quarter give u sense expecting remainder beyond second quarter whether comfortable prior guidance term ability get back range end year thank youronen faier chief financial officer sure andrew thank question start saying still playing rule small number relatively explain little bit general amount battery planned guided gross margin certain level exceeded approximately million additional battery sale anticipate given fact demand battery singlephase battery united state better expected entire result actually related difference margin battery low margin compared planned regular quarter regular business level would minimal effect revenue level relatively large essence little bit zerosum game battery based battery cell already acquired already inventory question quickly consume definition sell lot right sell le next year going basically consume shift margin general already baked second quarter gross margin guidance assuming slightly higher battery sale initially anticipated started year beginning already second thing course given small revenue assume grow toward end year assume impact size difference mix minimal change would call stabilized margin projection andrew percoco morgan stanley analyst understood ok helpful guess followup maybe bridge cash flow expectation year maybe thinking liability management think debt maturity next year think thinking relates cash flow expectation year liability management thank youronen faier chief financial officer sure course cash especially time low revenue one major item keeping eye mentioned prepared remark expect quarter actually lowest cash point year main reason position right fact see revenue declining already guided q q still commitment inventory procurement also manufacturing toward contract manufacturer mean first quarter still manufactured actually sold course result fact pay inventory pay vendor happens second quarter phenomenon actually reversing going start selling actual manufacturing actually going utilize inventory billion cash sitting form product going start reversing expect cash start generated already expect see cash generation q going see intensified generation q q higher revenue also higher utilization inventory andrew percoco morgan stanley analyst thanks muchronen faier chief financial officer way complete convertible one currently course amount treat debt money treat debt work assumption money refunded debtholders simply make sure cash position taking account something use operatorwell take next question brian lee goldman sachs line openbrian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guy good afternoon thanks taking question jumped call late apologize already addressed ronen update u sort seeing pricing environment taking new action yous know past saying yous pricing situation pretty stable europe past said mid high singledigit price decline planning implement implemented already see action potentially needed term pricing europe given market dynamic followupronen faier chief financial officer sure brian thanks question actually already started implement price reduction various form quarter would divide two first one price reduction implemented battery something done across board across product simply mean buy today battery lower price used region trying actually make price reduction little bit effective way help customer need remember customer sitting large amount inventory sometimes reducing price loyal customer channel lot inventory inferior position someone entering market le inventory therefore little bit damaged something course want trying match various price reduction initiative help example europe today see lower ratio optimizers channel compared inverter mean channel buy optimizers basically temporarily reduced price optimizers region order make sure distributor buying optimizers basically get lower price sell way entire system lower price allowing get better pricing also help get rid inventory accelerating inventory clearing definitely flexible way put lot thought use reduction amount use properly yes every region separately yous must say see lot right mentioned environment relatively stablebrian lee goldman sachs analyst ok helpful know lot focus gross margin guess little surprised revenue pickup q gross margin guidance improving bit know lot like volume fixed cost driver absorption driver ultimately going big part gross margin ramp back guess two question action taking kind get back target ex ira still appropriate target anything maybe surprised challenging thought getting maybe gross margin uplift better volume near term thank youronen faier chief financial officer sure surprise side given fact still expect see gross margin said along toward end year see change end target two main difference see right compared maybe quarter ago one rate selling residential battery yous little bit quicker thought relatively limited revenue dilute margin low margin product result way zerosum game quicker consuming mean margin recover completely get rid battery easier part second part actually related regular seasonal effect see every year usually second third quarter summer see little bit higher spending actual warranty expense see first replacement unit easier go roof replace unit sometimes see little bit higher failure rate summer really combination faster battery sale surprise overall ocogs target longterm target remains exactly brian lee goldman sachs analyst right thanks much pas onronen faier chief financial officer thank youoperatorand move next philip shen roth capital partner line open philip shen roth mkm analyst guy thanks taking question first one followup pricing ronen check suggest guy may launching may launched recently new promotion european resi segment buy buy kilowatt get optimizer free wondering could comment civic around promotion sense across europe sense last may september curious talk dynamic inventory standpoint seems like might still year left inventory european resi segment might slow thing channel clearing standpoint distributor get coupon buy optimizers least product given dynamic think european channel clear agree might little bit slower thanksronen faier chief financial officer first initiative mentioned phil exactly last answer exactly one tool taking basically saw see higher ratio inverter optimizers within channel europe result fact beginning problem provide inverter everyone ordered many slowdown market came identified whether like lot distributor buy quite lot optimizers necessity decided reduce price across board product mean would really benefit price decrease given fact need optimizers initiative around optimizers easy let u help distributor exactly need buy allowing buy cheaper optimizers basically giving one every kilowatt initiative mean need know like four instead five basically mean sell full system inverter little bit quicker kind initiative simply helping clear inventory little bit faster time time clear much different various distributor actually also much different sometimes various product distributor tell distributor example ordered lot commercial inverter given fact enough many maybe many one distributor order much little bit lack inverter average see see much lower sorry inventory level reflect year believe year continue see gradual runoff product shelf one day across board product finished continue see gradual increase revenue gradual increase shipment gradual clearing inventory expect case see year worth inventory total shelf europephilip shen roth mkm analyst ok thank color shifting housekeeping question q guide talk u expect ratio inverter optimizers q thanksronen faier chief financial officer give yet simply fact seen shift number every small difference shipment making big difference general expect see higher ratio optimizers inverter quarter quarter would say even upcoming quarter would say expect higher normal one volatile environment surprised little bit diversion directionally one one philip shen roth mkm analyst thank pas onoperatorwell move next mark strouse jp morgan line open mark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah thank much taking question outside pandemic year kind looking back history kind thought ability bring cost per watt kind mid high single digit looking forward learning new product coming kind curious talk generally expect efficiency improvement cost decline kind line versus kind step function change talk aboutzvi lando chief executive officer yeah mark thanks question think gave answer typically life product generation product able reduce cost roughly rate average price decline market kind per year able take larger step cost reduction move new generation especially moving higher capacity generation one advantage architecture module level electronics cost per watt kind fixed inverter side able reduce cost per watt larger inverter market go larger system enables cost reduction generally speaking high level look nextgeneration threephase inverter discussing enable step function reduction cost per watt compared current generation inverter size installation range shift generation compared annual rate clear enough mark mark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah yeah helpful look forward seeing quick followup ronen going back low margin singlephase battery able quantify inventory look like said clearing couple time curious mean crystal ball think later year color would greatronen faier chief financial officer thanks mark first way looking industry performance last quarter crystal ball easy general way look basically product based around one gigawatt acquired samsung actually expected always basically ending remember history around end year course industry little bit slower used believe enter market inventory year believe see replacement new product question going combination two thing one continue see market adopts product second expect product ready zvi talk next call make sure basically continuing product much needed order make sure product gap one thing would say right fact selling battery little bit faster others also fact threephase battery enjoying much better margin europe right sale relatively low given situation europe look improvement gross margin related battery end year beginning next year quickly clearing course important factor also portion battery within overall residential battery sell right portion high middle believe done inventory mark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst thank youoperatorand take next question colin rusch oppenheimer line open colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy product redesigns evolution give u sense much cost feel like could take important margin trajectory guy talking going back normalized level zvi lando chief executive officer yeah thanks question think first ronen correct margin projection ronen discussing dependent new product releasing volume looking rest year volume new product impacting dramatically financials alluding varies one different product take battery battery cost strongly dominated sale move current generation next generation dependent cell price become efficient mechanic power electronics potential cost reduction end day limited talking next generation inverter new component efficiency potential step function reduction cost significant referring new threephase inverter taking account looking installation side targeting inverter segment large residential installation able serve solution probably range lower cost per watt inverter compared serving application current generation inverter necessarily cost reduction achieved every size installation target design target size application think going main driver market point optimize cost like say power electronics generational move range reducing cost per watt colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst helpful guy emergence virtual power plant residential level importantly commercial level investment guy made talk little bit ability monetize quickly evolution offering cadence evolution ability really get embedded customer particularly commercial levelzvi lando chief executive officer would separate vpp virtual power plant one application grid service today prevalent residential commercial able monetize subscription long vpp program active remember top head number battery residential system today form vpp huge otherwise would probably able report much better margin margin flow cash vpp growing growth rate huge happens generate revenue software capability enable residential part generating type revenue commercial different story offering much much broader virtual power plant provides value wide range capability energy efficiency load management etc expect able higher ratio high relatively high ratio software service recurring revenue generation process something rolling gradually grow gradually see big impact number next month something long run source highmargin revenue colin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks muchoperatorwell move next austin moeller canaccord line open austin moeller canaccord genuity analyst hi good morning first question see potential change tariff legislation coming could benefit yousmade inverter battery similar recent change bifacial panel zvi lando chief executive officer beyond ira help clarify questionaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst recent change tariff ruleszvi lando chief executive officer yeah aware anything think said adoption increased use bifacial panel good thing module level power electronics provider incremental added harvest module level power electronics bifacial panel significant regular panel completely side note related regulation aware anything cooking similar nature space operate inaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst ok given interest rate remain high trend started see core yous market like california around leasing arrangement rooftop solar zvi lando chief executive officer think general expectation increase lease versus loan evident market black white complete switch see dynamic well entrance new lease provider trend tendency benefit ira creates thirdparty ownership definitely evident evident battery market like california puerto ricoaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst excellent thanks detailsoperatorwell take next question kasope harrison piper sandler kasope harrison piper sandler analyst good evening thanks taking question apology covered joined late wondering could share thought forward trajectory nonsolar business look like lost roughly million q believe million annualized cell manufacturing becoming little bit competitive wondering think path either getting toward breakeven operating income selling business shutting focusing core solar businessronen faier chief financial officer sure kasope thanks question general start maybe little bit dynamic go heart question dynamic point view usually storage market especially market storage division active much back year loaded revenue mean usually see low q relatively strong q general expect see growth revenue activity segment therefore least directionally loss related storage division go move forward toward second half year lot first half second half directionally segment think two area segment need look first one segment concentrated making storage whether collected solar something see great advantage kind capability even selling battery collected pv knowledge development technology helpful u continue see multiple application see storage without solar way anecdote sell today sometimes residential battery without pv backup general kind asset something see great value invest basically segment developing product like every developing product take second part segment actually owning cell manufacturing sella mentioned sella sorry mentioned next generation residential battery use nmc cell given dynamic market lfp chinese cell cheap compete therefore understand cell used residential battery however niche application much suitable nmc niche application first large enough much today sella actually nicely profitable area general developing right product moving toward selling product niche related frequency regulation control spinning control see time overall believe profitability coming segment matter quickly able utilize sella course quickly develop product right see value segment see value developing technology course like everything business evaluate time time continue kasope harrison piper sandler analyst appreciate ronen helpful quick followup think mentioned million cash low point year walk u driver increasing cash balance rest year given operating income negative stillronen faier chief financial officer course think main reason today fact take manufacture least large volume take stop manufacturing adjust level selling see way painfully hard grow manufacturing capability want mean fourth first quarter fourth quarter first quarter took u break train manufacturing basically adjust manufacturing layer happens yous yous manufacture much level inventory something already ended manufactured sold mean need pay vendor either component manufacturing something continued q way continue slightly q happens meantime first collecting customer balance good quarter come collection continue q new sale outside united state going revenue coming inventory already already paid thing start turn cash flow positive q still see payment related manufacturing q see cash generation q lower q q q expect relatively strong cash flow generation way operating also much le spending capex anything else kasope harrison piper sandler analyst appreciate thank youronen faier chief financial officer thank youoperatoroperator instruction move next jordan levy truist line open henry robert truist security analyst hey henry jordan thank taking question start dig little bit deeper piece expect see around inventory reduction kind next quartersronen faier chief financial officer hear well sorry henry robert truist security analyst yes hear ronen faier chief financial officer yes dohenry robert truist security analyst start give little pacing expect around inventory reduction next quarter ronen faier chief financial officer sure general think also relates see inventory clearing time actually spacing also ratio much inventory using right first last two quarter sale united state higher compared rate sale europe last quarter channel inventory mean manufacturing united state almost everything sell united state pacing inventory clearing little bit slower start see europe growing fact european inventory already manufactured pace going grow come pace finishing kind inventory would assume finished good inventory started year approximately twothirds cleared toward end year course pace going dependent quickly market recovers end year finished good twothirds clearing year linearly take like q toward end year order get assumption takehenry robert truist security analyst awesome thanks quick followup outside california puerto rico mentioned main yous region set demand perspective battery sale quarter demand relatively steady state rest country thank youzvi lando chief executive officer yes hawaii hawaii different story think state high attach rate two state mentioned definitely increase level battery takeup also arizona also extent texas probably operatorand take next question vikram bagri citi line open vikram bagri citi analyst good evening everyone wanted follow sellthrough guidance gave second quarter believe said middle quarter wondering like highlight market seeing strength imagine market growing faster rate market sort underperforming relative rate identify market seeing level strength market seeing impact promotion price reduction implementedzvi lando chief executive officer yeah thanks question first multidimensional talking split geography well segment added really sellthrough distributor online data fact quarter mean much information front u get accumulated bit later say country europe showing faster growth rate right italy switzerland mentioned germany bit slow expectation begin pick legislation week ago probably specific data seen would say italy switzerland stand bit probably also commercial showing case faster growth data combination track installation rate sellthrough although little bit one month quarter think lot definitive information give topic probably mentioned evident country referred vikram bagri citi analyst great related note mentioned gaining market share innovation feature solaredge one software particularly ci side also residential side going forward see rd line item million annual basis could talk plan gaining market share going forward yous europe strategy differentiated software side innovation hardware side upcoming fully appreciate thank youzvi lando chief executive officer thanks question hardware bread butter year expertise expertise rd team power electronics significant differentiator company definitely core priority u mentioned gave example prepared remark nextgeneration threephase large inverter european market targeting growing segment definitely plan route differentiation basis hardware traditional factor mind efficiency cost capability around interaction battery inverter lot thing refer conversation around safety coming optimizers constantly introducing unique safety feature completely basis hardware infrastructure capability said refer rd investment definitely ratio software hardware investment today different year ago software take bigger portion much important customer world used based feed tariff mattered
