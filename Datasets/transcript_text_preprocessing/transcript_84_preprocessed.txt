nadeau td cowen please go aheadphil nadeau td cowen analyst good afternoon thanks taking question two u first suzetrigine formulary access discussion stuart think made interesting comment thought enabling reimbursement ahead opioids acute pain setting something government program could help incentivize something effect could speak bit particular formulary access discussion suggesting absence legislative initiative likely reimbursed opioids acute pain setting second small commercial question give u sense big brazil could cf franchise thanks reshma kewalramani president chief executive officer yep phil ask stuart comment cf brazil know regulatory approval reimbursement well formulary discussion suzetrigine make sure page formulary discussion separate discussion policymakers common theme stakeholder frankly stakeholder aware opioid crisis high awareness suzetrigine enthusiasm using nonopioids discussion separate stuartstuart arbuckle chief operating officer yes add reshma would say phil policy initiative seen far really looking trying reduce financial disincentive patient indeed institution select brand nonopioid market obviously currently dominated generic opioids thing like pain providing additional payment drg outpatient ambulatory surgical center setting important patient side alternative pain act looking medicare part ensuring copay disadvantage patient using branded nonopioid market already generic opioids would say kind policy landscape kind slightly different discussion institution stakeholder much clinically based whether right medicine used patient prescribed dispensed medicine institutional setting would describe difference conversation obviously linked way different focus policy side institutional sidephil nadeau td cowen analyst maybe follow basis question recently survey physician thought patient would step generic opioid vertex expectation wellstuart arbuckle chief operating officer really speculate exactly going happen instance institution hope would happening think reasonable expect patient step therapy significant side effect liability including addictive potential product available good efficacy pain control perspective excellent safety tolerability profile including lack addictive potential think would something would certainly advocating think would particularly medically reasonable answer second part question
