see opex currently expected grow midteens come would think looking provideddarrin peller wolfe research analyst yeahsanjay kalra chief financial officer know actually taking prudent conservative approach term need mentioned earlier really need spend opex majority opex needed spent year growth year growth coming booking last year planning spend term need book outer year growth term main question spend majority spend sale marketing think rd ga marginally go significantly growth mean opex growth mainly sale marketing said also want highlight one thing know majority spend discretionary nature know manage business carefully fact regular review opex trending dial based cp trending operating leverage strong saw last year like dropped plus bottom line incremental cp dollar happen planning choice think manage way business progressing glad position operating leverage way aredarrin peller wolfe research analyst understood great thanks guysoperatorthank next question andrew bauch well fargo line openandrew bauch well fargo security analyst hey thanks taking question wanted put finer point hiring plan particularly sale marketing highlighted sanjay know mentioned prepared remark function converting backlog also said extending growth year priority guess qualitatively like kind anticipate sale marketing investment come augment growth gotomarket strategy could put finer point quantitatively like ultimately kind expecting based current plan sale marketing expense growth sanjay kalra chief financial officer yeah andrew said know modeling perspective would come around think midpoint growth opex put finer point quantitatively would say know give percentage specifically would say bigger piece material piece sale marketing remaining piece rd ga piece also depends ga term thing come know endo insurance renewal example couple renewal got good benefit last year know market trend cost significant cost go year going stay flat go would think marginally go significantly take biggest piece increase sale marketing remaining two within sale marketing think much go growth pipeline outer year versus backlog implementation would say two thing well material portion would go generating additional pipeline outer year smaller piece modest piece backlog implementationandrew bauch well fargo security analyst qualitative piece like anything changing gotomarket strategysanjay kalra chief financial officer well basic gotomarket strategy significantly changing one thing continually looking vertical need get get made significant progress would say last two year diversifying newer vertical seeing good progress good traction pace accelerate diverging new vertical would continue change strategy overallandrew bauch well fargo security analyst got make sense followup know sanjay mentioned contribution guide slightly wider revenue guide gave called know uncertainty around macro lot mix dynamic mean seeing anything thus far around amount type biller network fee know would lead inform u wider range contribution profitsanjay kalra chief financial officer andrew interesting question interestingly aware specific change learned among know would say last two quarter look contribution profit quarter try analyze trend noted degree visibility given point time current quarter much better full year know look q guidance versus full year taking broader approach quarterly variability exists example see q growth exceeds revenue growth mean q cp growth exceeds revenue growth q similar revenue growth change quarter quarterly variability exists one difficult metric forecast said know variability cp impact bottomline ebitda calibrate opex manage profitability depending upon cp trending result would say utility cp contribution profit key key metric diminishing time hence also call secondary metric know utility limited mainly use calculate rule hence thought prudent take approach rather taking narrow range many factor ultimately manage bottomline target dialing opex maybe mouthful maybe asked hope provides perspective insight think metricandrew bauch well fargo security analyst helpful thank youdushyant sharma founder chief executive officer also may add sanjay mentioned earlier deliver growth opex actually even though everyone know work nondiscretionary service nondiscretionary industry internal opex context actually rather discretionary able turn dial operating leverage feel feel good top bottom end guidance despite variability cp essentially message want communicate know trend business feeling good capturing market share able profitably grow business moving right directionandrew bauch well fargo security analyst lot clear thanks dushyantdushyant sharma founder chief executive officer thank youoperatorthank next question line tientsin huang jp morgan may proceedtientsin huang jpmorgan chase company analyst hey good afternoon good result couple clarification share nrr year came together fiscal might different also disclose booking backlog growth versus prior year curious magnitude benefit theresanjay kalra chief financial officer hi tientsin disclosed number thing asked fortientsin huang jpmorgan chase company

officer yeah sorry yeah qualitatively would say nrr well booking pipeline growing going decent pace would say giving u confidence exceed q expectation delivered strong quarter proud time q also marching good way think headed say right direction whole year given exited strong backlog think metric qualitatively providing u lot encouragement confidencedushyant sharma founder chief executive officer tientsin may add one key reason wanted point point exited enough bag could actually deliver top end guide three metric metrices two primary one secondary cp primarily based strength backlog growing year year feeling good welltientsin huang jpmorgan chase company analyst yeah sound way thought would ask question quick followup dropthrough incremental margin around ebitda quite strong running around fiscal looking simple math make sure sound like hiring come called know adjust opex depending contribution profit land primary difference thinking dropthrough incremental margin versus sanjay kalra chief financial officer righttientsin huang jpmorgan chase company analyst thank youoperatorthank next question line rebecca lu citi may proceedrebecca lu citi analyst thank hi guy give u update jp morgan partnership think year two ago expected partnership pretty meaningful contribution think nowdushyant sharma founder chief executive officer thank rebecca question proud part proud partnership jpmorgan chase great partner great organization going extremely well area looking forward great jpmorgan chase also strong partnership ecosystem looking forward frankly think gotomarket strategy sanjay also mentioning earlier increasingly partnership become big big factor u jpmorgan chase strong partner u also partner software vendor fintech provider onrebecca lu citi analyst ok want ask contribution profit slightly different way profit margin declined last year negative impact inflation looking outlook even top end range also assuming decline well conservatism anything else might thinking aboutsanjay kalra chief financial officer rebecca two piece two answer share individually number one onboarding larger customer enterprise customer enterprise customer pricing definitely different smaller midsize customer due volume discount get got bigger transaction sorry much larger transaction base think result contribution profit margin getting softer little bit totally fine given strong operating leverage know hence call contribution profit contribution margin secondary metrices really matter much longterm growth model purely dependent revenue growth ebitda dollar growth good question analyze cp margin going end day easily managed adjusting dialing opex really matter bottom line think could situation see cp percent getting softer maybe could still get better manage expense better current longterm model talked ie topline growth bottomline adjusted ebitda dollar growth annually would think cp margin get better also probability depending upon kind customer get would think upside ebitda although planning know get right think applying prudent approach trying say contribution profit contribution margin really secondary overanalysis might produce optimum result understand companydushyant sharma founder chief executive officer may also say one thing sanjay alluded biller make change larger biller come play imagine scenario saw large deal going contribution profit say million change le concerned point exactly transaction contribution profit transaction concerned quickly efficiently serve customer net operating margin biller live platform end good based
