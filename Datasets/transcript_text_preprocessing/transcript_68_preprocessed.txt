expectation full year regard customer mix sound like gross margin guidance seeing higher contribution enterprise hoping could comment dynamic seeing cloud titan thank youjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yes chantelle described gave guidance november much visibility beyond three six month go activity q alone believe continue first half much beyond expected true across three sector cloud ai titan provider enterprise feeling good three therefore raised guidance earlier probably would done may think would ideally liked look two quarter chantelle think think felt good enoughchantelle breithaupt chief financial officer yes think saw diversified momentum mix momentum gave u confidenceunknown speaker great thanksoperatorand next question come line samik chatterjee jp morgan line opensamik chatterjee jpmorgan chase company analyst hi thanks taking question guess jayshree chantelle appreciate sort raise guidance full year look halfoverhalf basis term implying math correct implying sort halfoverhalf growth go back look previous year probably one year last five six sort range every year better wondering mentioned q activity seen across board seeing bit halfoverhalf uptick sort momentum back half thank youjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer thanks like anything else number getting larger larger activity translate larger number course see improve even guide appropriately quarter moment feeling good increasing guide know arista traditionally early year please read confidence cautiously confident optimistically confident nevertheless confidentsamik chatterjee jpmorgan chase company analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line ben reitzes melius research line open ben talking hear youliz stine director investor relation operator go back themoperatorall right move next question mr reitzes hear u please hit star one move next question george notter jefferies line opengeorge notter jefferies analyst hi guy thanks lot want key something think guy said earlier monologue mentioned ethernet better infiniband note incomplete could remind exactly talking comparison making infiniband anything would love learn thatjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer certainly george historically know look infiniband ethernet isolation lot advantage technology traditionally infiniband considered lossless ethernet considered loss property however actually put full gpu cluster together along optic everything look coherents job completion time across packet size data shown data gotten third party including broadcom every packet size realworld environment independent comparing technology job completion time ethernet approximately faster look thing silo look practical cluster practical cluster already seeing improvement ethernet forget ethernet know today ultraethernet consortium improvement going see packet spring dynamic load balancing congestion control believe number get even bettergeorge notter jefferies analyst got assume talking roce opposed straight ethernet correctjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer case right pre uec talking rdma ethernet exactly roce version deployed nic scenario said roce seeing improvement imagine go uecgeorge notter jefferies analyst know guy also working version ethernet presumably blend uec standard time think differential might relative infiniband sense might look likejayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer metric yet like working version ethernet working uec compatible compliant version ethernet two aspect switch others nic right switch think already built architecture call etherlink architecture take consideration buffering congestion control load balancing largely make software improvement nics especially looking see improvement give u additional performance server onto switch need half work together thanks georgegeorge notter jefferies analyst thank youoperatoryour next question come line ben reitzes melius research line openben reitzes melius research analyst gosh hope work timeliz stine director investor relation yeah hear nowben reitzes melius research analyst oh great thanks lot wondering characterize seeing nvidia market right seeing go head head see evolving mind also think nvidia move systemsbased approach potentially blackwell see impacting competitiveness nvidia thanks muchjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yes thanks ben loaded question first want bank nvidia jensen think important understand would massive ai networking opportunity nvidia build fantastic gpus yes see market time mostly using network gpus nvidia market leader think created incremental market opportunity u reduced see market course see gpus also see roce rdma ethernet nic side sometimes see obviously pushing infiniband part de facto network choice might heard say last year year outside looking ai networking today feel pleased able scaleout network nvidias gpus nics based ethernet see nvidia direct competitor yet ethernet side think business business worry overlap think got year founding experience make ethernet switching better better front end back end confident arista build scale network work nvidia scaleup gpus thank benben reitzes melius research analyst thanks lotoperatoryour next question come line amit daryanani evercore isi line openamit daryanani evercore isi analyst good afternoon thanks taking question guess jayshree given executive transition seen arista perhaps talk dixon discussion board around desire commitment remain ceo anything touch would really helpful go back job completion data talked given said expected improvement reason customer would still use infiniband versus switch aggressively ethernet thank youjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yeah well first heard anshul sorry see anshul decide thing hope come back lot executive make youturn time call boomerang certainly hope true anshul strong bench blessed constant bench last year rare industry silicon valley sorry see anshul make personal decision take break know remain wellwisher know bench strength anshul step greater thing commitment board committed multiple year think wrong order wish anshul stayed retired committed staying long timeamit daryanani evercore isi analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line antoine chkaiban new street research line openantoine chkaiban new street research analyst hi thank much taking question see nvidia introduced innetwork computing capability nvswitch performing calculation inside switch perhaps best time announce new product curious whether something broader merchant silicon ethernet ecosystem could introduce pointjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer antoine asking new product ai questionantoine chkaiban new street research analyst asking specifically innetwork computing capability nvswitch matrix multiply add inside switch wondering something broader merchant silicon ethernet ecosystem could introduce welljayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yeah everyone el benefit lot innetwork compute generally done closest compute layer possible processing gpu natural place see reason could function network offload network compute function would require little state built processing power etc certainly doable think going half dozen would prefer closest compute layer would like networkwide network scale network layer feasibility much case antoine thanks antoineantoine chkaiban new street research analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line james fish piper sandler line openjames fish piper sandler analyst hey thanks question anshul miss around echo sentiment hope see soon jayshree guy thinking timing gig optic availability versus kind use system keep alluding kind nextgen product announcement multiple quarter one expect around adjacent use case core including ai software kind take u product road map direction canjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yeah james might remember like deja vu similar discussion gig well know build good switching system need ecosystem around whether nics optic cable accessory believe start seeing early introduction optical switching product gig actually build entire ecosystem take advantage especially nics think take year think probably even said think going see lot system discussion earlier going see half dozen going see lot system demonstrate high rating scale gig go east west much wider build large cluster ten thousand need gpus source gig even recent gpus need higher rating higher performance see ecosystem gig limiting deployment ai network important thing remember thanksjames fish piper sandler analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line simon leopold raymond james line openvictor chiu raymond james analyst hi guy victor chiu simon leopold expect arista see knockon effect ai networking front end edge customer eventually deploy ai workload based sorry biased toward inferencing maybe help u understand might able size casejayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer simon really good question taken consideration phase production absolutely right say back end back end connect something typically rather reinventing ip adaptive routing would connect front end compute storage wan network take consideration million projection naturally see deployment backend cluster resulting uniform compute storage memory overall frontend backend holistic network ai coming next phase think make lot sense first want get cluster deployed lot customer fully expecting holistic connection one way one reason look favorably u want build disparate silo island ai cluster really want bring term full uniform ai data centervictor chiu raymond james analyst thanks muchoperatorand next question come line meta marshall morgan stanley line openmeta marshall morgan stanley analyst great thanks maybe flip james question kind ask see kind bottleneck going pilot ultimate deployment sound like necessarily gig matter time piece ecosystem need fall place deployment take place thanksjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer would call meta bottleneck would definitely say timebased familiaritybased situation cloud everybody know deploy sort plug play way even cloud may recall many use case emerged first use case emerging ai networking let u build fastest training workload cluster looking performance power huge consideration cooling gpus huge part would surprised hear lot time waiting facility waiting infrastructure set right o operating side ken quiet would love chime tremendous amount foundational discovery go need cluster need hashing need load balancing need set layer layer need visibility feature need connect across wan interconnect course rightly pointed whole seeing le lot familiarity understanding operate cluster best job completion time visibility manageability availability gpus nobody tolerate downtime ken would love hear point view thisken duda founder chief technology officer senior vice president software engineering yeah thanks jayshree look think lacking people deployment availability piece huge pentup demand stuff see cluster getting built fast people build facility get gpus get networking need think extraordinarily well positioned got year experience building scaled storage cluster world largest cloud player storage cluster identical ai cluster issue managing massive scale backend network need properly lowbalanced need lot buffer manage burst congestion management stuff done also useful ai network particular infiniband topic keep coming would like point ethernet year old year ethernet come headtohead bunch technology like token ring sonet atm fddi hippi scalable coherent interconnect mirrornet battle one thing common ethernet reason metcalfes law value network quadratic number node interconnect anybody try build something ethernet starting large quadratic disadvantage temporary advantage detail tech cycle going quickly overwhelmed connectivity advantage ethernet think exactly many year take infiniband go way fiber channel sure headedmeta marshall morgan stanley analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line ben bollin cleveland research company line openben bollin cleveland research company analyst good afternoon everyone thanks taking question jayshree made comment back guidance november three six month visibility could take u type visibility today maybe compare competes different subset customer differ thank youjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer thank ben good question let take category like said cloud ai titan november really searching even three month visibility six would amazing today think year tough situation u cloud titan pivoting rather rapidly ai thinking cloud much seeing balanced approach still ai exciting also expanding region cloud would say visibility improved least six month maybe get longer time go enterprise know bellwether macro everybody else citing macro seeing macro seeing chris schmidt ashwin entire team profound amount activity q better normally see q q usually come back holiday january slow east coast storm deal winter still strong one strongest activity q lead u believe get better rest year hence guide increase otherwise conservative team chantelle right tier cloud provider want speak moment strong u right starting pick ai initiative well large close cloud titan combination service provider tier specialty provider also seeing momentum overall would say visibility improved three month six month case enterprise obviously sale cycle even longer take time convert win activity never higher thanks benben bollin cleveland research company analyst thank youoperatorand next question come line michael ng goldman sachs line openmichael ng goldman sachs analyst hey good afternoon thank much question encouraging hear migration trial pilot anets production roll support gpus range think said gpus first wondering could talk key determinant end range high end versus low end second assuming per gpu would imply billion compute spending anets target million would high end think talked networking percentage compute historically wondering could talk may missing anything call assumption thank youjayshree ullal chair president chief executive officer yeah thank michael think could better next year point well taken order go gpus lot thing come together first let u talk data center ai center facility tremendous amount work lead time go power cooling facility talking kind production opposed proving something lab key factor second one gpu number gpus location gpus scale gpus locality gpus go blackwell build scale inside server scale network whole center gravity nice watch constructive number gpu lead time significantly improved mean customer get gpus turn mean build scale network lot work going third thing would say scale performance much rating want put give quick analogy ran something similar cloud talking fourway cmp eightway cmp railway design often called number nics connect go eightway fourway way switch go gig performance scale third metric think power gpu locality performance network three major consideration allow u get positive rate production
