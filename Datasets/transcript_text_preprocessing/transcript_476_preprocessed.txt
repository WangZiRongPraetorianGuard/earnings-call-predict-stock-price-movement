please go aheadjim ricchiuti needham company analyst thank two question first ev portion business light mixed demand trend reading geographically ev business seeing business instance line sight sense may little bit removed happening ev battery siderob willett president chief executive officer yes thanks jim spent lot time last two quarter meeting lot ev battery manufacturing company tell huge investment going industry particularly europe america cognex two really kind vector would say growth one building line customer building ev production line coat cut line stack inspect ev battery right arei visited europe last week two company investing billion right automation obviously real momentum shortterm thing right soand machine vision key new line newbuilds one would expect cognex one preferred supplier quite challenging machine vision kind task go secondso think sort like newbuild greenfield type scenario might familiar industry cognex second thing going manufacturing ev battery competitive innovation side also pretty dangerous legally concerning thing company concerned inspect quality developing technology market advantaged computational imaging company bought last year sacactually say deep learning technology helpthose two technology together allow u image incredible speed definition scratch dent problem diagnose deep learning technology see whether problem visited number company last six month said extraordinarily challenging expensive task scrapping huge number good battery concerned become problem fire etc later two thing going jim really would say sort sweet spot cognex downside think hearing think hearing anxiety anxiety ev successful think perhaps niche kind product wealthy customer broadly going cannibalize lot internal combustion engine business haveso kind one issue one hand see slowing sale ev relatively poor ev number reporting big company think concern becoming little cautious enduser consumer another end user vector one chinese company byd talking developing selling ev car soand really selling broadly market perhaps america le focused plenty interested confused vector final one term longterm demand see customer concern political change support ev business right mostone specific large ev producer asia certainly communicated putting investment yous hold see clarity political environment mean subsidy would expecting receive

experienced automotive pronounced china around world cognex certainly electronics key part business china mentioned certainly large customer confident maintaining share large smartphone company also ev space highly advantaged think well positioned grow help grow need china also think seeing early inning longterm shift manufacturing away china could benefit u nicely year beyond seeing production capacity moving china particularly u india vietnam making sure strong presence relationship place help transition obviously ev battery opportunity sort overcapacity china stagnation resulting business around world particularly europe yous growing overall view would say business strong group committed cognoids china seeing low turnover term people leaving business lot enthusiasm around new product new technology celebrated th anniversary near end last year saw lot kind cognex culture playing strongly seasoned management team certainly think business kind expect china year come lower result opportunity elsewherepaul todgham chief financial officer yes jacob add couple point specific kind financials maybe first comment heard china maybe little better start january seasonality china asia broadly slightly different part business typically see step q q comment may true would see seasonality perspective basically flat year ago flat q q guide answer quite different looking sequentially seeing little bit stepup asia looking year year expecting china weaker year ago depending lens one aspect color would give full year result areagain rob mentioned year china constant currency five percentage point drag fx weaker cny biggest piece biggest contributor consumer electronics business consumer electronics business overall business weak number worse disproportionate impact consumer electronics play generally follow different macroeconomic driver factor core chinese business think important sort separate two certainly going year know team call difference meaningfuljacob levinson

revenue possibly confident reporting good result logistics consumer electronics potential really come back strongly said early say automotive view sort longterm grower industry look like challenge moment ev think confident contributing driving growth potentially offsetting decline internal combustion engine business butso probably would rank lower big industry expectation thing change quickly sort thought joejoe ritchie goldman sachs analyst yes helpful totally appreciate potential volatility helpful color guess maybe two real quick one making sure thought gross margin progression correctly first quarter rest year sound like expect get back plus percent gross margin q also question around free cash flow kind expectation free cash flow year seemed little bit lighter anticipated q comment around would greatpaul todgham chief financial officer sure think without guiding beyond current quarter virtue roughly basis point drag one strategic logistics project think kind get back hopefully seeing moritex drag versus long term certainly persist fully integrate achieve synergy impact volume deleverage mix change little bit quartertoquarter obviously growth driver going help u get back target margin specifically free cash flow biggest driver free cash flow u obviously profit get leverage growth expect obviously would help little higher investment working capital q sort
