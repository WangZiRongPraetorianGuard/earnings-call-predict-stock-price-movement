call operator open question question answer operatoroperator instruction first question come andrew percoco morgan stanleyandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst great thanks much taking question good evening guy maybe kind starting margin apology missed number think mentioned basis point impact volumedriven price discount battery mix shift maybe kind reiterate go number term much expect come back first quarter maybe cadence beyond first quarter term back half year expect get get thank youronen faier chief financial officer sure thanks question first explain little bit term direct gross margin impact general price charge customer price changed dramatically first quarter mentioned battery started increase cost previously mentioned second part course cost pay contract manufacturer also way something relatively fixed given cost bill material manufacturing cost contract manufacturer look first level direct gross margin difference certain level revenue amount customer size customer different volume discount number one number two actually little bit important influential quarter mix product first thing would say basis point loss gross margin compared previous quarter lot actually related fact portion single phase battery much higher previous quarter need remember battery manufacture based sale acquired samsung agreement signed end time way nmc battery price skyrocketed result since related also raw material index war ukraine price went dramatically mean today selling battery singlephase battery made samsung sale gross margin low second thing happened actually oversupply environment customer managed well inventory able either grow actually need product maintain growth large customer strong buying power therefore general customer usually would say le overall revenue quarter like sometimes overall revenue number mean example second part would still say biggest difference first coming battery customer hope helped side happens next quarter next quarter two thing happening first thing across mix product expect see customer see little bit le large customer lower gross margin simply fact right need second thing overall portion singlephase battery likely slightly lower compared saw quarter mean expect majority basis point come back majority add one important thing andrew think maybe thing discus call situation see today mentioned jb channel much filled inventory dynamic zvi mentioned see today customer buying typical order solaredge used x inverter x optimizers case customer stopped buying buy thing see sometimes see little bit abnormal situation customer buying inverter much optimizers quarter actually way around saw lot customer buying inverter optimizers sometimes sorry optimizer usual ratio inverse may see mentioned quarter threephase battery german country relatively heavy channel inventory start clear see higher purchase product enjoy nice gross margin would say cadence coming back level saw mostly related stabilization inventory situation channel expect see second half year start see back level inventory normalized see little bit would call reasonable natural ratio productsandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst great super helpful maybe one followup question demand sound like still bullish european demand acceleration beyond first quarter residential commercial still somewhat muted negative yous outlook maybe help u bridge gap driving demand europe purely power pricedriven energy security driven seems like macro environment somewhat similar geography curious give confidence mediumterm outlook europe thank youzvi lando chief executive officer yeah thanks tried specifically actually break four segment residential europe commercial europe residential yous commercial yous europe know word bullish believe growth rate fourth quarter first quarter primarily based seasonality historical breakdown installation revenue europe various quarter combined regulatory clarification mentioned element together mind translate fact first quarter gradual improvement installation rate clearing inventory eventually revenue europe true segment residential commercial overall expectation stronger growth commercial residential related market dynamic enterprise push decarbonization relates europe yous see different pattern residential commercial seeing already mentioned commercial installation rate sellthrough point view continuing grow grew significantly fourth quarter compared third quarter record historical level perspective term sellthrough distributor still time inventory clear begin translate revenue u relatively optimistic continued growth commercial market yous lot driven enterprise module price point also availability ira product mentioned begin deliver q deliver volume q source expect positive trajectory ci yous residential yous segment le optimistic growth least short term expect market continue bit slow gradual trend people realizing sell operate within nem environment california see slow growth trajectory regard availability ira product later year especially installers tpos learning construct business benefit ira help push market forward bit later part year segment one see stagnant europe see gradual growth resi commercial yous expect continued growth commercial perspective installation rate point sale eventually clear inventory result revenue well expectationsandrew percoco morgan stanley analyst thank youoperatorthank next question come philip shen roth mkmphilip shen roth mkm analyst hi everyone thanks taking question wanted explore capital plan bit think guy talking potential buyback think cash net debt roughly plus million seems like may burned million q macro remains challenged first half year could guy situation need raise capital talk plan manage liquidity dynamic general much cash would like maintain balance sheet thanksjb lowe head investor relation sure general cash flow operation quarter mentioned million usual also little bit capital expenditure look next year let u first try understand cash dynamic discus capital allocation basically going quarter quarterly revenue lower cash sorry ar balance right approximately million ar balance collect collect slower want given fact customer seeing difficulty confident ability collect second thing happen course fact since sitting large inventory level product course expected replaced near future example optimizers started fourthgeneration selling product year product usually shelf life therefore expect see lot revenue continued sold inventory currently carry manufacturing come mostly yous ira purpose want course capitalize benefit second place want maintain manufacturing capability next year result going likely year going generate substantial amount cash least would say second quarter trend start reverse sense expect cash flow raise unfortunately growing rapidly would say working capital need usually le pronounced second part come capital allocation fact execute plan long feel comfortable cash position feel comfortable today acquiring solaredge share company good use cash company would call measured way make sure matching pace purchasing stock pace cash generation order make sure running something go bad problem case course going would say concise going continue generate cash flow inventory customer think right see need raise capital believe actually generate little bit capital believe buying stock share right solution end one thing capex spending general trend since reducing manufacturing footprint course invest much le capital expenditure related manufacturing capacity increase past example activity ramping right united state supported equipment already purchased testing equipment already built mobilized factory see low usage cash high generation cash measured responsible purchase share still believe time good use moneyphilip shen roth mkm analyst thanks color shifting outlook demand outlook q sorry million q saying back half million million talk yearoveryear growth really seasonal really comparing q q also get level revenue expect new gross margin outlook million midpoint excluding ira also ira thanksronen faier chief financial officer first start describing would call revenue environment two q answer margin mentioned prepared remark saw q sellout sellthrough channel approximately million way based estimate actually even installation rate happened throughout understand sorry q understand two thing happening especially look beginning year first thing saw decline installation rate fourth quarter toward end year something usually happening overall holiday season fact actually winter europe started relatively early year relatively strong therefore belief throughout year first fact see seasonality europe going back least second third quarter something expect increase underlying demand saw compared q since shipping channel point time simply eventually adjust would call installation level see sold million sellthrough higher installation look market one one believe see least higher installation rate end way including new product zvi mentioned baked plan commercial battery tracker kilowatt inverter feel much confident looking market market going go year happen expect eat majority inventory excess inventory channel way least q estimated quarter half worth inventory excess inventory sitting channel see installation rate continuing undershipping go quarter quarter believe end fourth quarter relatively minimal view trend see based discussion customer analysis historical trend saw seasonality end market market also political regulatory environment gross margin situation come gross margin mentioned prepared remark expect back million million revenue quarter ship gross margin already include basis point ira benefit way get actually twofold one course regular product gross margin change significantly cost point view high inventory actually bake small asp erosion throughout year expect actually cost relatively flat price going little bit see much normalized distribution geography customer therefore product margin go back little bit second thing ocogs part discussed past first combination costsaving measure taken q come reduction force closure mexico reduction china coupled lot work quality product front starting changing component product automotivegrade component already show lower course failure rate therefore requires lower cost service warranty also lower warranty accrual also little bit fix existing fleet come software also reduces amount expect see even compared last time million little bit lower fixed cost ocogs saw driver currently see aim million million revenuesoperatorthank next question come brian lee goldman sachs mr lee line openbrian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guy sorry mute thanks taking question ronan apologize going kind beat dead horse little bit followup phils question bridge know gave lot gross margin clear typically sound like next couple quarter sound like plus basis point direct basis pointsplus cog given guiding q basically like flattish gross margin got like basis point spoken remaining bridge get guess struggling identified percentage point thousand basis point come followup would previously talked basis point included ira credit clarity optimizers applicable came december view changed always embed base case trying understand put take definitely bridge final thanksronen faier chief financial officer ok try least brian start second part easy said along assumption get come optimizers therefore basis point already assuming reach capacity inverter want reach megawatt quarter certain level optimizers way approximately million optimizers quarter expect run rate end q something already baked projection gave actually come bridge two thing see believe first product gross margin see modest increase q q already going recover lot basis point lost balanced mix product see actually direct gross margin expect lot thing expect lot actually ocogs part simple assuming number mean example million q divided million revenue gross margin impact imagine moving million revenue need take divide three come approximately million gross margin added whole story make even think easy explain built cost structure support company relatively diverse segment point view product point view serving complicated segment ci example mean relatively heavier cost associated kind company built reduce revenue even reducing cost unless reduce exactly level reduce revenue see pl impact working small revenue basis see right impact gross margin simply huge bridge economy scale even without changing cost fixed cost bridge going come simply economy scalebrian lee goldman sachs analyst appreciate ok make sense one pas one maybe little bit nitpicking think last quarter said talking like million million revenue quarterly view end year kind normalize saying million million something embedded updated view three month share loss pricing seems like something downticked bit number range may precision begin trying understand one something changed much guess confidence visibility million million maybe changing going forwardronen faier chief financial officer ok think said million million remember based sellthrough level saw q assume level throughout quarter lot work going deeper channel understand happening looking installation rate dissecting almost every country various trend see talking way lot installers actually understand exactly see well one thing little bit le prior period simply able get thing little bit accuratebrian lee goldman sachs analyst understood right pas thanks guysronen faier chief financial officer thank youoperatorthank next question come kashy harrison piper sandlerkashy harrison piper sandler analyst good afternoon everyone thanks taking question first one provide u maybe detailed way get million sellthrough q million million talking middle year also give u sense total dollar product attempting destock channel much detail possible followupronen faier chief financial officer kashy first move million million toward second half year mostly related seasonality impact see case little bit analysis market went looked seasonality looked europe way prior covid war ukraine would believe little bit normal year looked normal year usually saw increase q q q q simply see market behaving first thing looked level see right q little bit january happening netherlands know little bit shift market simply went one one looked united state level see sellthrough behaves simply one one added information coming source software called designer allows installers design system homegrown product looked many new design made past many turned real installation level see right took account actually consolidated various source data historical current order get point forgot second part question please dollar inventory expect clear sense mentioned see sellthrough million fourth quarter mentioned based assume quarter half worth excess inventory sitting channel believe clear mentioned jb million million first quarter going gradually declining toward end year going exactly linear going decline toward end year still see small amount q basically assumptionkashy harrison piper sandler analyst thank detail really appreciate followup question opex post tough restructurings declining think said million midpoint think q million look change revenue though saying sellthrough million million maybe selling peak million guess question behind reluctance aggressively attack operating cost structurezvi lando chief executive officer think use million million indicator trajectory believe transitional point developing product ronen mentioned well even number million million including product already released generating revenue albeit dramatic impact overall number transitionary point size company taking action order able grow past midterm based see industry evolving see portfolio evolving order thiskashy harrison piper sandler analyst fair enough thank youzvi lando chief executive officer thank youoperatorthank next question come mark strouse jpmorganmark strouse jpmorgan chase company analyst yes good afternoon thanks much taking question lot focus near term appreciate number wanted go back risk though think last call talked kind trying protect ability market rebound quickly wanted position meet demand airship thing dealt last several year reduction force though mean signal kind structural change looking kind medium term also kind followup detail provide far reduction force impact resi versus ci yous versus europe kind market geography anything provide reduction force thank youzvi lando chief executive officer yeah think correlate also answer previous question course reduction force uniform across department operation company determined impact significantly rd capability maintain strong presence region term close customer able service properly manufacturing infrastructure believe meet need near future flexible grow beyond part assessment methodology implemented would say even even positive note net number rd people working today new product development year ago big part working component replacement adjusting thing related supply chain constraint regard actually think better situation today mentioned discontinued project area emobility discontinued peripheral project broader solar energy market concentrated residential commercial offering complete solution everything generation storage consumption everything inverter battery ev

question come colin rusch oppenheimercolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst thanks much guy change volume looking component sourcing talk little bit adjustment thinking term actual component cost volume break going way guy take volume might reverse get balance year next yearronen faier chief financial officer first colin start fact given inventory level see right lot cost change year take inventory level expected revenue see pretty much covered year course continue manufacture yous enjoy ira maintain area expect shortterm situation come component first strategic component strategic component manufacturer agreement discussed term agreement move forward think discussion timing consumption volume rather pricing right thought also component price spiked covid usually related overall would say global trend rather volume consuming yes expect see lot change always way little bit change cost per unit manufacturing unit manufacture usually go least come level see try reduce manufacturing location instead maintaining many location reduce volume one something relatively also going staying flat major change expected near futurecolin rusch oppenheimer company analyst excellent sale team given suppressed level sale obviously guy really effective sale team historically talk sort retention metric engage giving folk little bit bigger geography work team changing shape incentivized going forwardzvi lando chief executive officer yeah also one previous question global sale force le impacted reduction force wanted keep strong sale force strong link customer think buy level royalty motivation sale force large extent u long time experienced industry experienced company understand cycle take place optimism continuation cycle side together making sure properly incentivized work maybe bit difficult bullish market think happy level engagement motivation optimism see across sale force various geographiesoperatorthank next question come christine cho barclayschristine cho barclays analyst hi thank squeezing first question determine undership every quarter think mentioned going continue undership yearend le subsequent quarter front load undership forecast discussed trajectory revenue improvement factor potential market share loss gain pricing decrease might look move yearzvi lando chief executive officer yeah first part question actually customer determine determine ronen mentioned breadth product even though talk lot inventory channel various product still either high demand way short lot revenue driven trying push customer product need responding need either anticipation something going happen market inventory decline specific product line modeling plan obviously lot focus share believe taking action enable u gain share factor

chinese string inverter price going sometimes little bit used see past channel starting clear inventory price play little bit part come u need adjust price along year mentioned expect see price going across board would say mid high single digit year going continent product general side still play important part actually fact offering provided today offering provide considered premium product come software capability ability respond dynamic charge fact make lot change software air time change product capability relation see market dc capital battery therefore certain benefit allows u continue

understanding tendency toward modulelevel electronics benefit term energy harvest safety etc expect still main philosophy north american market far see strong shift another direction said europe good offering string inverter elaborated competitive environment environment competition coming becoming challenging comfortable quality offering differentiationoperatorthank next question come joseph osha guggenheim partnersjoe osha guggenheim partner analyst hi guy two question first talked lot expect happen yous relative europe progress think million million run rate wondering think breaking europe versus yous also perhaps commercial versus residential thank youronen faier chief financial officer joe please repeat questionjoe osha guggenheim partner analyst let u think q million million talked much think might europe versus yous today think breakdown might look term residential versus commercial marketronen faier chief financial officer yeah think resi versus commercial said anticipate commercial grow higher rate residential typically megawatt basis recent quarter roughly two expect looking trajectory ratio megawatt basis different course revenue basis lean bit toward commercial term ratio yous europe mentioned expect mild growth two segment europe residential commercial expect stronger growth north american commercial level stagnation north america residential overall think relative q expect europe bigger portion sellthrough eventually revenue going closer majority europe much higher portion north america q bit different think going continuation year ratio europe increase relative ratio yous ratio commercial increase slightly compared residentialoperatorthank next question come tristan richardson scotiabanktristan richardson scotiabank analyst hey good evening guy appreciate commentary lot asked answered maybe curious dialing europe little bit talk maybe netherlands historically component europe see going million million particularly sort limbo term happens long term policy perspectivezvi lando chief executive officer yeah netherlands think well known strong market u historically actually reference point think installed base residential home netherlands storage system believe someday maybe day ruling last week bit thought originally many home solaredge battery added solaredge solar system already exists netherlands significant stronghold u good market u kind par germany term size business u although different scale size market mentioned mentioned prepared remark compared baseline existed surge demand netherlands u increased installation rate early part declined think run rate installation run rate netherlands right said earlier believe ruling overturn net metering right overall part really give strong longterm clarity market think people go saying want solar maybe need solar going get metering saying ok net metering near future maybe make sense put solar hard say really going drive surge market think going improve maybe lead level definitely level still strong good market also see already uptick battery adoption lower used u definitely peak operatorthank next question come ameet thakkar bmo capital marketsameet thakkar bmo capital market analyst hi good evening one question wanted come back guess comment earlier kind expectation free cash flow entering think expectation q going positive free cash flow kind wondering could kind maybe pick part like expected increase finished good inventory change payment term ar balance caused guy kind deviate kind push little bit respect free cash flow generation thanksronen faier chief financial officer sure think combination two start fact needed extend payment term sometimes want sometimes extend payment term customer understand customer experience lot would call cash difficulty right fact sellthrough lower also collect little bit lower fact work way large customer give u little bit confidence ability collect would say sometimes wanted – sometimes forced collect little bit slower one interesting phenomenon customer end year need present financials simply chose pay instead th december third january well first part second part inventory buildup million inventory buildup happened addition course inventory buildup saw q q usually pay vendor average within day paid inventory buildup happened q quite lot buildup happened q sale q materialize eventually combination two end result saw think mostly abrupt stop revenue sorry reduction revenue coupled customer would call inability pay neededoperatorthank next question come austin moeller canaccordaustin moeller canaccord genuity analyst hi good evening first question attach rate currently seeing home battery inverter yous versus europezvi lando chief executive officer obviously varies significantly country germany attach rate remain well italy working memory range said netherlands take representative market yous europe excuse yous also varies course market california overall attach rate right split course remaining nem installation necessarily take battery nem take battery mentioned sellthrough battery yous something percent fourth quarter assume majority going california attach rate gradually increasing state yous fairly low would memory probably range sooperatorthank next question come vikram bagri citivikram bagri citi analyst good afternoon everyone apologize wanted ask one
