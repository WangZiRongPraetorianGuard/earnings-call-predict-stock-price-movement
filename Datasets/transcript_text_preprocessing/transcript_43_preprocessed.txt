operator instruction first question today go line andrea tan goldman sachs please go ahead line open andrea tan goldman sachs analyst good afternoon thanks taking question carl maybe back data presentation aacr thinking additional data need generated spur strategic interest transaction curious spoken past deal capture value platform remind u would entail would ass merit deal thanks much carl hansen president chief executive officer thanks andrea happy take first let say working platform area tce roughly two half year time made terrific progress building platform provides building block create tce believe highly differentiated capability demonstrated vitro really punchline data showed aacr focus course able take data show translates vivo model ultimately clinic ultimately make difference patient term dealmaking remain optimistic able make deal access platform look across platform industry believe something differentiated solve problem others continue engage conversation would say response broadly appreciation science toolkit something actively working would speculate timing would meantime also moving forward translational side said toward vivo model toward clinic see major value driver one overarching reality field people excited class people working class starting see data coming solid tumor encouraging broadly speaking think consensus important class immunotherapy time one know exactly crack solid tumor going need work done model done clinic going abcellera also going need engage partner make sure platform used broadly currently focusandrea tan goldman sachs analyst got scenario would consider advancing one maybe independently becomes third internally developed programcarl hansen president chief executive officer yeah absolutely said prepared remark see platform highly differentiated see important basis foundation make strategic partnership area tce oncology also autoimmunity also see important source internal program one thing probably exciting tce platform place really start understand science behind crack open numerous opportunity prosecuted would say little lift higher probability success expect transfer one program quite excited definitely see one source internal program would willing take forward clinic ourselvesandrea tan goldman sachs analyst thanks muchoperatorour next question today line kripa devarakonda truist please go ahead line open kripa devarakonda truist security analyst hey guy thank much answering question followup question tce platform beyond discovery think add greater value broader tce space general think currently recognized strategics broadly ask question followup one prior question different way slide presented shown multiple different tce targeting psma bh mentioned differentiated clinical benchmark decide develop one internally one develop unique firstinclass improving competitive landscape thank carl hansen president chief executive officer great question first think asked bring outside discovery short answer point put place platform toolkit making tce shown bring forward create molecule would characterize discovery point shown value outside discovery happens move translational model move clinic take time something pushing forward think different platform broad diversity cd allowed u better understand engage cd cell interplay engage cd engage tumor antigen control response cell example shown graph objective get high potency killing minimal cytokine release address one problem tce doselimiting toxicity associated cr example psma highlighted specifically could imagined compelling example able completely decouple potent cell killing cytokine release astonishing result one excited yet shown said translate animal model clinic next step part part course discovery abcellera year making living working best world solving difficult discovery problem think cd side engaging tumor multiple target even finding good binder certainly diversity binder difficult coupled bispecific engineering provides complete solution problem intend show validated solution clinic course going take time question program shown going decide one bring forward mean short answer combination commercial consideration meaning competition well primarily science date started five different program oncology also started program autoimmunity point two program oncology going bringing forward one bringing forward animal study going need make decision based result based data based happening field based think biggest opportunity course weighing program coming
