allow u repeatedly generate molecule potential firstinclass bestinclass therapy use platform partner work program build portfolio position future therapeutic program within broader frame growing portfolio program done would call partnerinitiated program converting andrew detailed potential passive royalty stream going mature time past three year started evolve business model include codevelopment program bigger stake last five year working consistently technology project yielding wholly owned potential firstinclass bestinclass asset taking forward clinic portfolio side know let u say singledigit royalty position add aggregate believe longterm predictable highmargin cash flow program bringing forward would view like would view typical integrated biotech potential generate huge upside value taken time find opportunity excited believe excellent chance getting value inflection going look independently decide going prosecute moving forward clinic committed take forward phase mentioned prepared remark excited program see potential take beyond phase given nature development abcl area atopic dermatitis inflammation autoimmune condition think value program would benefit partnership question know bring molecule forward get closer revenue get derisked ind past phase obviously potential term outlicensing going grow commensurately making decision every program based capital allocation based option maximize value expect abcl could valuable program outlicensing right focused getting phase robyn karnauskas truist security analyst right two followup attrition rate beyond think around recall expect become similar higher period color know discontinued program could take inhouse know develop capability could opine like would programsandrew booth chief financial

partner make clinic would expect rest make clinic continue report annual basisrobyn karnauskas truist security analyst discontinued program like think would take inhousecarl hansen president chief executive officer carl robyn know program advanced contractual right take inhouse would also highlight know andrew said expect considerable attrition initiation discovery clinical development certainly anyone experience industry would expect well program actually make clinical development program fail whole variety reason could scientific data come based animal model could competing program company matter pipeline prioritization capital allocation know thus far one seen advancing know contemplated taking inhouse honestly high conviction program generated internally focus internal

piper sandler analyst hey good afternoon thank taking question two first tcell engager platform hoping could characterize interest approach autoimmune indication relative oncology indication overall kind update disclosure expect platform next year second kind follow prior question new business metric providing could clarify metric provide going forward quarterly annual basis also think research fee milestone revenue near longer term thank youcarl hansen president chief executive officer thanks allison maybe start hand andrew metric financials think first question interest tcell engagers autoimmune know would say last year hot topic discussion variety partner probably aware exciting data car space particularly cd autoimmune condition lupus many people recognized car work indication real opportunity bring specific substitute would advantage much like drug easier get patient easier make business think exciting opportunity one well positioned move beyond much add autoimmune condition second asked update tce platform said know continuing advance platform get proof point internal program done tce platform currently four abstract submitted acr hopeful accepted able share data shortly public think scientific part maybe hand andrew last piecesandrew booth chief financial officer yeah hey allison thanks question business metric going forward quarterly basis continue report program start molecule clinic annual basis continuing report royalty rate sort average royalty rate aggregate milestone accumulated reported also k well would intention report attrition graph progression molecule handed back partnersallison bratzel piper sandler analyst excellent thank youoperatorthank question next question line steve willey stifel line opensteve willey stifel financial corp analyst yeah good afternoon thanks taking question would couple guess line sight completing forward integration process via completion manufacturing think talking pilot run going end year start engaging potential partner even codevelopment partner pd front kind proposed workflow contemplates manufacturing end product wait pilot run done start engaging kind dealscarl hansen president chief executive officer hi steve carl think exactly right development candidate picked first step move generation cell line start develop process ahead manufacturing building pd team ahead certainly position year begin working process development leading manufacturing every confidence pilot run facility online support conversation begin right also add know mentioned prepared remark targeting bring least one additional development candidate forward year expectation would able manufacturing one one start finishsteve willey stifel financial corp analyst ok maybe tce partnership follow guess pd conversation date either guess shaped kind deal want type deal think kind given data shared today progress made panel cd variant preference something exclusive versus nonexclusive kind curious thinking thiscarl hansen president chief executive officer yeah mean always dangerous speculate deal exactly structure going know exactly right talking company strong interest certainly help get smarter type deal think maximizing value platform conversation helpful real question andrew asked something similar like key data really combination moving data forward enough finding right partner good alignment making sure deal really capture value platform wanted execute tce deal could done several tce deal last year passed think best interest longterm value platform issue continually evaluating navigate going forward want get deal validation much important longterm state business right deal make sure selling cheapsteve willey stifel financial corp analyst maybe one quick follow guess one maybe two additional candidate might moving forward kind past discovery year addition think also kind fall either tce gpcr ion channel bucket term guess higher valuecarl hansen president chief executive officer sure think mentioned probably likely source candidate going work gpcrs ion channel know wildly excited love program probably every bit excited prospect effort going long time start generate exciting molecule hoping able deliver least one perhaps two platform think side chance could also come tce program really side prioritization deciding like data opportunity beststeve willey stifel financial corp analyst right thanks taking questionoperatorthank question next question line steve dechert keycorp line opensteve dechert keybanc capital market analyst hey guy additional color provide three new partner initiative program started fourth quartercarl hansen president chief executive officer would say know often see pd activity second half year often start

puneet souda leerink partner line openunknown speaker hi yeah michael puneet wondering pickup inaudible later year wondering like typical seasonality bd activity seeing pickup decent amount biopharma influence kind outlook much codevelopment asset sale might kind near termcarl hansen president chief executive officer hey michael thanks joining puneet think sort predictable seasonality bd deal flow know irregular past also irregular would read anything regarding know quite robust quarter mentioned going consider program contract really meaningful business metric people turning people attention going forward going stop reporting quarterly basisunknown speaker got wondering visibility whether five preclinical asset might getting clinic sometime carl hansen president chief executive officer hi thanks follow mean would hope hand partner moving pace would say like progression seen past take number year one particularly excited well could expect let u say already disclosed abdera company worked radioisotope conjugate indicated think least one would come clinic definitely keeping eye one particular insight schedule areunknown speaker got thank muchoperatorthank question next question line steven mah cowen line opensteven mah td cowen analyst great thanks taking question hey think rd expense going forward especially light know advancing two internal program indenabling study second part question know given cadence inds one two could give u color driving cadence could enough multiple compelling candidate seems like cash manufacturing capacity accelerate wanted fair statementandrew booth chief financial officer hey steve take think carl chime second one well end rd expense mentioned prepared remark would expect relatively flat versus last year expense last year expense related clinical development certain number program certainly bringing indenabling study would expect actually similar relatively flat overall regarding second question carl mentioned would expect two additional program getting development candidate toward indenabling study actually would reach ind phase would expected start pace roughly two development candidate year would inds going indenabling study expected inds appears pace cadence getting let carl talk capacity maybe limiting feature thatcarl hansen president chief executive officer sure happy maybe first emphasizing prepared remark believe advancing internal portfolio going biggest value driver long run abcellera focus making sure building portfolio moving forward effectively number putting certain number inds board completely able look data look opportunity look commercial case get excited much better average chance bringing forward molecule going drug help patient fundamental bottleneck finding opportunity getting science point really conviction believe program deserves added portfolio far bottleneck piece event working many program lot happen hit year could imagine know number would run bottleneck operationally able manage manufacturing get ind package together preclinical work frankly would know problem would welcome given nature working could pace program target industry known many year seeing antibody move forward people able solve problem would love backup exciting firstinclass molecule move forward currently place putting neck little bit saying hey year hoping get least one breakthrough perhaps two add two program development candidatessteven mah td cowen analyst ok great really helpful color last one followup question manufacturing know given recent discussion yous government bio economy securing domestic allied supply chain guy applying yous government funding bio manufacturing know bio production thank youcarl hansen president chief executive officer good question know probably know close interaction darpa yous government past certainly would welcome currently engaged type conversation interesting sure seen geopolitical factor making important manufacturing inhouse north america think really playing well strategy believe long run know ability continue generate firstinclass asset highly strategic able control supply chain pd manufacturing

kind going metabolic obviously hot see differentiated maybe know fit kind rapidly evolving metabolic space thank muchcarl hansen president chief executive officer sure happy take question turn first question decide know program working far take look partner know first know deciding every point development invest program looking four key dimension looking science looking commercial opportunity looking potential differentiation looking practical path development every asset every opportunity need looked four dimension step start get clinical development think one big question whether better keep inhouse better look partnership depends scale resource need commit definitely game betting everything single asset diversifying portfolio beginning going continue also clinical development capability know indication particularly indication competitive term patient enrollment much better done large established company think atopic dermatitis probably pretty good example combination resource allocation practical believe effectively going create value patient company keeping hand finding right partner find right partner question exactly nature partnership thing need evaluated omnibus strategy rather casebycase basis based best information timeevan seigerman bmo capital market analyst helpful guess kind else would want sharecarl hansen president chief executive officer yeah much share mean highlight think potentially firstinclass antibody therapy gpcr ion channel target area metabolic endocrine disorder know compelling data nonhuman primate believe high likelihood
