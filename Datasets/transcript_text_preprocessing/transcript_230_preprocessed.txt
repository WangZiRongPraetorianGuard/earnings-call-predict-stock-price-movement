guess first guess maybe kind get april q closed couple week ago sure book finalized color give u far kind q shake maybe directionally revenue look like well cash balance early view qpaul travers chief executive officer know grant want get cash balance stuff tell uptick q number believegrant russell chief financial officer cash side would generally sort follow last couple quarter far net change cash balance minus fund flowing domestic license support little unexpected amounttyler burmeister craighallum capital group analyst sorry fair enough guess maybe another grant could help maybe level set u costcutting effort making maybe called million annual level looking reduce previously maybe far along baseline level thinking million come given onetimeinnature expense couple moving piece would maybe help level set everyonegrant russell chief financial officer mean still stand million sort annualized target mean saying q cost came little higher would hoped take time slow tanker honestly looking cut feel get operating expense million annual basis would love get closer looking potentially another cut operating expense would like try implement next quarter wait business accelerate fast expectingtyler burmeister craighallum capital group analyst ok helpful guess maybe last one paul said least one potentially two another one closely behind defense firm oem opportunity working expect ramp year framework give u potential financial term might look like number might look like around would helpfulpaul travers chief executive officer yes help actually fourplus program right really active two literally front end delivering first production device kind unit price anywhere system kind volume talking somewhere upwards piece course knock wood see one two program start roll year point showing customer like getting positive feedback right cusp kicking offtyler burmeister craighallum capital group analyst right sound great guy appreciate itoperatorthank next question come line aaron martin aigh investment partner please proceed questionaaron martin aigh investment partner analyst apologize star one pressed earlier call technical difficulty guy talk little waveguide big facility term level talked able produce hundred thousand level get scale cost perspectivepaul travers chief executive officer well let say aaron facility right hundred thousand level production little new investment need make graduate million plus unit annually would also suggest get beyond big investment need expand facility process could probably add facility right run three time kind number set good spot crank production investment think well worth itaaron martin aigh investment partner analyst talked facility getting waveguide cost point radically lower anyone else question level build existing capacity get cost perwaveguide production cost target levelspaul travers chief executive officer yeah first let say care trying produce right making piece quantity price going better vuzix making making going better vuzix wherever scale path folk part expensive honestly even know product going able go marketplace kind price point waveguide even making small unit volume highly competitive said even making piece really nicely scaled kind volume price give want careful say sharing everybody number add course margin lot people business scale pretty easily aaron get good price pointsaaron martin aigh investment partner analyst ok costcutting measure talked getting operating expense say million time frame thatgrant russell chief financial officer goal would accomplish exon cut next quarter stress cash basis carry pretty good burden nonstock noncash stock compensation related ltip mean annual basis think july team going work hard make difficult decision without sacrificing future soaaron martin aigh investment partner analyst ok great thank muchpaul travers chief executive officer thank aaronoperatorthank question time would like turn floor back paul closing
