point know want guide next year even qualitatively help u sustain margin level asked last year sort exited thing crashed first half year help u think put take next year high base going exit year atdave zinsner chief financial officer yeah good question additional startup cost next year think percent revenue basis lower help lift margin course expectation would see growth revenue also help top already seeing good decisionmaking changing decisionmaking around operate new different business structure point lot stuff actually show pl decision get made year lot decision made sorry lot benefit decision show next year year see benefit well thing kind whipped margin around bit last year notion reserve material way prq pat mentioned sierra forest prq ordinarily take whole bunch reserve sierra forest would release started shipping beyond prq date going forward help adjust volatility gross margin function revenue growth profile fabs startup cost mixjohn pitzer corporate vice president investor relation tim followup questiontim arcuri ubs analyst yes want ask server cpu share march think assumption march service share going pretty flat question case sound sound maybe little bit le

john pitzer corporate vice president investor relation jonathan next caller pleaseoperatorcertainly next question come line srinivas pajjuri raymond james question pleasesrini pajjuri raymond james analyst thank question client side think pat mentioned something supply constraint impacting q outlook could provide color causing supply constraint expect ease guess go second half term ai pc think talking million potentially shipping year could maybe put context actually help intel higher asp higher margin would think product also come higher cost want understand think benefit intel ai pc ramppat gelsinger chief executive officer yeah thank overall seen hot product aipc category declared finished last year incrementing aipc core ultra product volume throughout meeting customer commitment come back asked upside multiple occasion across different market racing catch upside request constraint back end waferlevel assembly one new capability part meteor lake subsequent client product working catch build waferlevel assembly capacity meet help u hey new category new category product generally higher asp question suggests also think new use case new use case time create larger tam creates upgrade cycle seeing creates new application seeing essentially every isv ai behind app whether communication capability zoom team translation contextualization whether new security capability crowdstrike others finding new way security client whether creator gamers taking advantage see every pc going become ai pc time kind cycle underway srini everybody start say oh upgrade platform even demonstrated using ai pc intel factory improve yield performance inside factory described like centrino moment right centrino ushered wifi scale see ai pc ushering new use case scale going great industry unquestioned market leader leader category creation think going differentially benefit emergence ai pcjohn pitzer corporate vice president investor relation srini followupsrini pajjuri raymond james analyst yes john thank guess question bucket think dave kind talked altera potentially exiting year billion run rate current level pretty steep ramp also think said next growth accelerate next couple quarter given telecom weakness seeing curious giving visibility confidence mean driven new product market recovering color would helpful thank youdave zinsner chief financial officer yeah altera unprecedented see massive work inventory course significantly impact revenue normalizes start shipping end consumption actually pretty easy lift get billion mark inventory digestion period think high confidence thatpat gelsinger chief executive officer others commented inventory cycle well fpga category good product second half year agilex starting ramp welldave zinsner chief financial officer nex course business also gone inventory adjustment good confidence around reversing help drive strength product tailored ai space course see like phoenix example see strength year drive good revenue growth year wellpat gelsinger chief executive officer yeah also nex ai networking product strong ipu product seeing strength area inventory well product even though question suggests communication sector service provider weaker year pretty much every aspect business ai dave said seeing strength go second half year john pitzer corporate vice president investor relation thanks srini jonathan next call caller pleaseoperatorcertainly next question come line vivek arya bank america question pleasevivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks taking question pat conceptual question gen ai server accelerator important role specific cpu easily interchangeable inaudible amd arm guess question workload done accelerator really matter cpu use move toward gen ai server essentially shrink tam x server cpu number cloud customer announced armbased server alternative curious think conversion gen ai mean x server cpu tam going forwardpat gelsinger chief executive officer yeah thanks vivek spoke vision event use case like rag retrievable augmented generation llm might run accelerator realtime data database embedding running cpu seeing data environment already running xeon x augmented ai capability feed llm believe whole area rag becomes one primary use case enterprise ai think llm might trained one twoyearold data right many business process environment realtime right going retraining constantly area frontend database becomes prominent database run x today enhanced use case like rag see unlock occurring data sits onprem data sits x database environment enhanced use case shown need accelerator case run billion parameter model natively xeon extraordinary tco value customer furthermore environment enterprise run today security networking management technology place need upgrade change use case see lot opportunity build enterprise asset xeon franchise also going aggressively augmenting commonly head note even accelerator used gpus used described xeon plus gaudi think going powerful opportunity enterprise many case see market lift new application new use case new energy coming enterprise ai year cloud workload moved cloud data remains onprem control enterprise much underutilized business today gen ai going unlock lot going happen x cpu see powerful cycle emerging would point back described vision great event many customer seeing value todayjohn pitzer corporate vice president investor relation vivek quick followupvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst yes thank maybe one dave potential operating loss kind model foundry business let u say exclude billion depreciation headwind assuming almost going foundry business right way dave think foundry operating income loss year much external foundry revenue expecting year thank youdave zinsner chief financial officer yeah good question operating loss pick roughly like ish first quarter pick second quarter given startup cost increasing would say roughly range remainder year said see improving going pat given order want see every quarter improvement operating loss ultimately get breakeven midway point think achievable sorry vivek second question still onoperatorno moved onjohn pitzer corporate vice president investor relation go next caller jonathanoperatorcertainly next question come line matt ramsay cowen question pleasematt ramsay td cowen analyst yeah thank many guy pat one question getting folk totally understand lead time starting program put increased tile volume external foundry guy made progress five node four year highlighted multiple time flex bring back external volume earlier think matter folk demonstration guy able ramp product volume yield economics might give indication external customer looking foundry business flex pull timeline sort reshoring external tile thankspat gelsinger chief executive officer yeah thanks matt largely decision made product decision made limited flexibility move around pick process node certain tile generally process node limited flexibility many decision highlighted matt literally made year ago right choice made said see peak external tile year next year road map movement coming back begin quite accelerate even starting late next year plan clearly laid said see couple fabs worth capacity coming back intel factory network move beyond becomes significant driver also driven significant road map decision improving profile product say begin powerful way next year panther lake clearwater forest unquestioned best product client best product server built intel question suggests see customer seeing every foundry customer speak right understanding product process cycle ability essentially benefit intel customer zero foundry network overall feeling good track go
