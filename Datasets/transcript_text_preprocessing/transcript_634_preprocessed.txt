happy poll audience question question answer operatorthank mitch conducting questionandanswer session operator instruction first question come line aaron rakers well fargo please proceed questionaaron rakers well fargo security analyst yeah thanks taking question kind framing outlook guidance calendar first quarter guess first question help u relative basis million data center gpu revenue expected q ultimately kind fell guidance q help u appreciate seasonal defined think server business q guidelisa su president chief executive officer sure aaron let start see jean something add relative data center gpu business pleased performance saw fourth quarter always going sort backend quarter weighted ramping product saw mia hpc product actually ramped well saw mix ai product actually exceed expectation based strong customer demand way qualification went ramp manufacturing ramp million business fourth quarter going first quarter look business server seasonality call something around let u call highsingledigit lowdoubledigit also piece data center business think key piece originally expected ramp little bit shallow mix seeing supply chain operating really well customer demand strong see mix increase go first quarter thing going relatively well sojean hu executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah aaron give color client seasonality others client similar server typically q highsingledigit lowdoubledigit consistent past embedded side consistent said past consistent see industry embedded business going bottoming process think q lowdoubledigit sequential decline embedded gaming side lisa mentioned prepared remark latest stage product cycle year five gaming console time also inventory customer combination impact expect q gaming sequential decline probably hopefully help little bitaaron rakers well fargo security analyst yeah helpful jean quick followup curious traditional server demand see know looked server cpu shipment north year year seeing signal thinking recovery traditional call nonai generalpurpose server market move lisa su president chief executive officer sure aaron look think agree characterization demand although see strong progress second half year especially customer cloud enterprise adopted genoa zen family going would say traditional server market probably still mixed especially first half year still cloud optimization going well sort enterprise little bit cautious case though also see opportunity u continue grow share traditional server business think portfolio extremely strong adoption genoa bergamo well new siena product line getting lot traction also see turin zen product coming second half year even mixed demand environment think bullish traditional server cpu operatorand next question come line timothy arcuri ubs please proceed questiontimothy arcuri ubs analyst thanks lot lisa wondering give u little bit sense term milepost kind marching toward billion tam example think gain share rate kind similar rate gained share server cpu guess maybe asked different way reasonable kind look consumer gpu share plus percent reasonable bogey aspiration higher perhapslisa su president chief executive officer yeah thanks tim question would say couple thing first really pleased progress made data center gpu business think ramp seen customer traction seen even last month think great give u lot confidence ramp business think beauty ai market growing quickly think market dynamic well ability gain share framework point make customer engagement right quite strategic dozen customer multigenerational conversation excited ramp mi frankly lot also excited opportunity extend next couple year timeframe think see lot growth think little early make market share projection would say significant growth driver given market demand well product capabilitiestimothy arcuri ubs analyst thanks lot jean guess followup know want guide full year wondering pin touch maybe milepost kind marching growth whole company reasonable target guess within data center add incremental data center gpu revenue assume server business grows little bit seems like maybe double year year kind wondering give u range number thanksjean hu executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer hi tim thank question yeah guiding year early year literally january think way think lisa mentioned prepared remark feel pretty good data center client business grow course largest incremental revenue opportunity going come data center server side gaining share data center gpu side significant ramp mi think think headwind gaming segment think year year see significant doubledigit decline gaming segment time embedded going bottoming process think secondhalf see recovery put take talk itoperatorand next question come line matt ramsay td cowen please proceed questionmatt ramsay td cowen analyst thank much good afternoon lisa wanted ask mean much focus scrutiny really exciting progression mi mean progressed last six month think doubt investment community software ability ramp product proven ramping think said dozen customer right across different endmarkets interested hearing little bit guy open forward program traditional server business look like roadmap perspective would interested hear thinking roadmap mi accelerator family going going continue part cpu gpu together primarily gpu roadmap kind cadence thinking would kind color give u forward roadmap trajectory program would really helpful thankslisa su president chief executive officer yeah sure matt appreciate comment think traction getting mi family really strong think benefited u use chiplet technology given u ability sort apu version well gpu version continue use differentiate get memory bandwidth memory capacity advantage go forward imagine like epyc timeframe planned multiple generation sequence way planning roadmap one thing note ai accelerator market demand compute high seeing sort acceleration roadmap generation similarly planning acceleration roadmap would say talk overall roadmap beyond mi get later year assured working closely customer competitive roadmap training inference come next couple yearsmatt ramsay td cowen analyst thank lisa followup guess one question getting lot different form respect billion tam guy laid maybe could give u little look hood guess got version question heck come number could give u little bit term talking system accelerator card talking silicon talking full server kind sort unit assumption kind thing give u onmarket sizing give visibility early generative ai trend give precise number three year would really really helpful thank youlisa su president chief executive officer sure well matt knowhow precise think said approximately billion think need look growth rate get growth rate think expect unit grow sort substantial doubledigit percentage also expect content going grow think important memory memory capacity go forward imagine see acceleration overall content go advanced technology node asp uplift also planning longerterm roadmaps customer term thinking sort size training cluster number training cluster fact believe inference actually going exceed training go next couple year given enterprise adopt think look piece think feel good growth rate going significant sustained next year term tam really accelerator tam within accelerator certainly gpus also asics accelerator tam think sort different type model smaller model finetuning model largest large language model think going need different silicon different use case standpoint gpus still going sort compute element choice talking training inferencing largest language modelsoperatorand next question come line joe moore morgan stanley please proceed questionjoe moore morgan stanley analyst great thank think talked mi cloud workload kind split customerfacing workload versus internal talk see breakdown ecosystem progressing brandnew chip seems impressive able support kind broad range customerfacing workload cloudlisa su president chief executive officer yeah sure joe yes look really happy mi come deployed working number customer seen certainly rocm important well direct optimization top cloud customer always said best way optimizing software working directly important workload seen performance come nicely expect frankly gpu capability would level optimization optimization gone well think broader question way look lot opportunity u work directly large customer cloud side well enterprise side specific training inferencing workload job make easy possible entire tool chain sort overall rocm suite really gone significant progress last six nine month also getting nice support opensource community work hugging face tremendous term realtime optimization hardware partnership openai triton work across number open source model helped u actually make rapid progressjoe moore morgan stanley analyst great followup guess lot forecasting business hearing coming supply chain sort hearing amd building x asia guess would ask u think looking kind soldout year supply chain would close revenue building bestcase scenario worry sometimes expectation people hear supply chain number curious bridge gaplisa su president chief executive officer yeah mean joe think updated revenue expectation quarter original number billion billion try give bounding discussion way think billion customer working given u firm commitment need know lead time product quite long important forecast early strong order book give u good confidence exceed billion supply chain standpoint goal always build supply standpoint also worked supply chain partner secured significant capacity think first half capacity tight come second half year certainly made progress supply going continue work customer deployment update number go yearoperatorand next question come line toshiya hari goldman sachs please proceed questiontoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst hi thank taking question one mi well lisa guess first think quarterly trajectory beyond q talked q sequentially fair assume kind straight line progress balance year second half skewed think guess importantly cloud potential customer yet officially signup signoff mi guess sticking point function time need little bit time go backandforth tweak thing software kind concern guess holding back pointlisa su president chief executive officer yeah toshiya thanks question first mi trajectory think would expect revenue increase every quarter sort end year bit second half weighted part customer finishing qualification line well sort supply chain ramping yes increase quarter bit second half weighted comment customer look engaged sort large customer folk know really well given deep relationship epyc think people different adoption cycle consider trying roadmap view still early inning u space think question asked earlier think key mi conversation really sort longterm multigenerational roadmap context working largest customer well know lot demand coming folk ai centric necessarily typical cloud customer enterprise let u call aispecific company also well engaged withtoshiya hari goldman sachs analyst got super helpful followup maybe one jean gross margin side guiding q curious sure going give quantitative guidance beyond q think trajectory q beyond pretty sure working kink pertains instinct ramp hopefully improves time tailwind fpgas perhaps second half turn better got server cpu volume growth throughout year feel like got multiple tailwind think gross margin progression sequential basis potential headwind move throughout thank youjean hu executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah toshiya thank question yeah absolutely right put take impact gross margin guided q basis point higher q sequentially primarily higher data center contribution actually offset decline embedded business q going forward way think said major driver going data center business going grow much faster segment mix change help u expand gross margin nicely think also spot embedded coming back second half tailwind data center gpu early stage ramp improving testing time yield continue expand gross margin expect accretive corporate average tailwind coming second half would say headwind side continue first half see embedded business q see sequential decline q probably going sequentially flattish versus q headwind u nice gross margin overall feel pretty good trajectory gross margin improvement especially second halfoperatorand next question come line ross seymore deutsche bank please proceed questionross seymore deutsche bank analyst thanks letting ask question wanted get competitive environment first instinct side thing going seem slowing ramp whatsoever also straight server cpu side thing lisa said gaining share area think future road map pricing incentive sort thing meaningful change competitive environment seeing throughout lisa su president chief executive officer sure ross look think environment u always competitive think changed look instinct side think think shown mi roadmap actually competitive place let u call even like training environment look inferencing environment think significant advantage showing customer work think training inference continue competitive go cpu side view generation epyc continued gain share think exited fourth quarter record share amd still quite underrepresented enterprise think opportunity u continue gain share go competitive standpoint see zen extremely competitive right genoa bergamo siena go turin deep design incycle zen turin feel good positionedross seymore deutsche bank analyst thanks guess follow data center side another theme pervasive throughout least gpu side driving cpu side mentioned still little bit cloud digestion going within epyc business see standing know going gain share etc guy fully benefit instinct side data center gpu side cpu side thing headwind behind u still issuelisa su president chief executive officer think expect cpu business market standpoint grow ross go think rate pace growth depend little bit macro overall capex trend standpoint starting see larger customer plan refresh cycle lot let u call older equipment yet refreshed value proposition refresh strong energy efficiency sort footprint newer generation much better sort four five year old infrastructure see refresh cycle happening get think exact timing understand market evolves go yearoperatorand next question come line vivek arya bank america security please proceed questionvivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks taking question first one lisa gave u billion plus number mi raised billion curious drove change incremental demand signal supply supply let u say demand billion billion billion right limitation sort related competition side competitor launch b later year think change competitive landscape anywaylisa su president chief executive officer yes sure vivek think said went billion billion really mostly customer demand signal order come book seen program moved let u call pilot program full manufacturing program updated revenue forecast said earlier supply standpoint planning success worked closely supply chain partner ensure ship billion substantially depending customer demand go second half year term roadmaps said focused competitive roadmap sort next generation beyond mi believe strong roadmap inplace continue work customer sort adopt roadmap quickly possiblevivek arya bank america merrill lynch analyst got longerterm question lisa look success amd enjoyed many factor included early adoption chiplets strong partnership tsmc seeing x competitor intel also adopt chiplet tile technology call think recently manufacturing update gave said two year ahead term incorporating gate allaround backside delivery let u assume right either caught tsmc maybe ahead impact amd kind medium longer termlisa su president chief executive officer yeah sure vivek look always looking next right chiplet technology mean sort fourth generation chiplet technology think learned lot optimize performance aggressive adoption leadingedge technology needed think piece also focused continuing innovate architecture design think longerterm question ask think expecting competition going similar process technology even case think feel like strong roadmap going forward continue drive cpu gpu roadmap aggressivelyoperatorand next question come line harsh kumar piper sandler please proceed questionharsh kumar piper sandler analyst yes hey thanks letting ask question guy two question let startoff accelerator side question get lot customer want understand value proposition mi lisa hoping could give u understanding price versus power comparison compute power today seeing customer buying mi primarily buying inferencing today using primarily tooling maybe jean jean think possible mi finish year runrate billionlisa su president chief executive officer ok harsh let start question value proposition mi customer using different reason presume performance per dollar benefit using amd one piece piece though intrinsically bandwidth memory capacity mix compared competition mean large language model many ten billion parameter make could potentially workload fewer gpus substantial system saving allows much work within system term customer using mi today would say number customer using large language model inferencing also customer using training think whole point strong partner put ai system inplace sometimes mixeduse system would used training inferencemitch haw head investor relation john time two questionsjean hu executive vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah harsh let answer question mi exiting q possible get billion possible right lisa mentioned earlier see sequential increase quarter backend loaded secondhalf supply billion course continue make progress customer math yeah possible right really looking focus execution current billion plusoperatorand next question come line stacy rasgon bernstein research please proceed questionstacy rasgon
