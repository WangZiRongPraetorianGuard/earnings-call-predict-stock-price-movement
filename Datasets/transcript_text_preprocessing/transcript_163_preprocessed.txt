thanks much question start dupixent thinking momentum seen important new indication copd guess wanted sort square positive commentary guess heard potential indication obviously significant unmet medical need also perhaps word caution get ahead guess certainly challenging done lot doctor seem think copd patient already know whether type information many case could talk point view challenge expect least initially potential bolus patient given currently option available potential challenge guess would think could ask second question quickly francois mentioned gross margin regard onetime adjustment would maybe go little bit detail much onetime first quarter perhaps could possible quantified would help thank youpaul hudson hi peter thank brian dupixent copdbrian foard global business unit head specialty care yeah thank much question really get ready launch copd first foremost start patient think seen brand going disease driven underlying type inflammation really opened new treatment opportunity patient really transform lot patient life think paul mentioned patient already therapy many actually happen asthma sufferer treated pulmonologist community imagine spoken pulmonologists extremely excited potentially new option treat patient quite frankly highest dose therapy think contextualize patient highest dos therapy still exacerbating contextualize right way saw reduction boreas areata trial effective actually adding reduction exacerbation rate positive think challenge particular patient population probably le patient population fact whenever bring new therapy like year biologic ramp take little bit time even though burden disease patient take bit time get physician used using biologics said pulmonologist community use biologics today feel like good spot preparing marketplace really quite well excited bringing whenever come marketpaul hudson thank brian houman anything addhouman ashrafian global head research development yeah hi peter asked specific question patient burden disease patient population want clear develop molecule boreas areata specific stratification strategy thought deeply eos concentration blood specifically pheno stuck knitting specifically saw phase reflected outstanding reduction exacerbation phase study think really important recognize sanofi go forward development strategy laserfocused enable launch highest unmet medical need population done confidence way population launch expandpaul hudson let add think brian remember give regeneron credit really pioneering ad u back beginning strong really build education around thing enter new area proper amount education work make sure right patient identified get supported think shared expect inflection point business evolution likely got work francoisfrancois roger chief financial officer yes good afternoon peter question inventory adjustment oneoff essentially q happened standard cost moving actually good news medium term revalue consequence existing inventory lower standard cost oneoff adjustment booked q expect get much q q balance year relatively sizable close half gross margin decline q mean expect gross margin see negative deviation versus last year progress yearpaul hudson thank next questionoperatorthe next question luisa hector berenberg luisaluisa hector berenberg capital market analyst hello thanks taking question wonder could get update consumer factor determine exit strategy timing pro con different exit route maximizing shareholder value wanted ask rilzabrutinib good data itp think sale opportunity also asthma phase positive high dose think asthma color around safety profile proceed asthma think next step phase b color endpoint trial design stepping stone phase thank youpaul hudson ok good francois cfcfrancois roger chief financial officer yes luisa francois speaking take question consumer want keep option open mean basically consider consider potential spinoff ipo probably partnering well private equity keep option open one single idea maximize value creation shareholder want comment pro con option time given working open view time keep posted progress year worried creating value shareholderspaul hudson want quick comment term technically readyunknown speaker sure mean first confirm excited track give maybe little bit color practical side system cloning activity happen successfully happened actually last week moreover well advanced determining scope transition service agreement important well meantime continue focus three strategic priority execute overarching mission make selfcare simple well underwaypaul hudson thank good question rilzabrutinib houman remember brian want comment potential value itp houman either houman want start houman ashrafian global head research development let start actually brian tagteam one luisa thanks question let u two part question itp asthma tolerability hit directly think still major unmet medical need itp know patient remain undercovered care particularly term lack stability platelet count also suffer substantially fatigue rilzabrutinib something great joy personally treated patient beauty treatment number element one obviously prevents production b cell hence btki inhibition also prevents phagocytosis platelet reducing platelet count mechanistically interesting compared standard care today undercovers patient also case required relatively extreme dietary modification will offer real opportunity point one point two asked tolerability date seen gratifying term tolerability every aspect pretty exciting question asthma super clear presented latest asthma data last year know excited data opportunity realtor become first oral advanced asthmatic treatment remarkable potential change paradigm treat asthma compared today say substantial pleasure invite everyone call come at meeting outcome study could thrilled sharing dimensionalize market going hand friend brianbrian foard global business unit head specialty care think really good question think saw rd day really started talk asset one asset talked slide think presented earlier really impressive show three potential indication csu itp asthma really differentiated versus competition therapeutic area specifically relates itp maybe go little bit broader say rare blood space actually think could potentially blockbuster across itp combined contextually speaking mean think two obviously itp little bit bigger see based size think patient see eligible itp really excited differentiated profile bringing patient soon possiblepaul hudson thank san diego ad weekend meeting looking forward seeing data presented next questionoperatoryeah next question graham parry bofa grahamgraham parry bank america merrill lynch analyst great thanks taking question first one tolebrutinib thinking scenario readout data given low likely annualized relapse rate going see control arm assume going similar ibrutinib see thought process perhaps actually progression would better primary endpoint possibility change statistical analysis plan relapsing study disease progression alternatively event see met primary endpoint gemini study hit endpoint progressive trial think could something priced higher market smaller overall m patient population progressive m drug first tolebrutinib second one beyfortus supply said make blockbuster year think understanding sort based know definitely supply working increased supply perhaps could sort dimensionalize quantify upside bringing supply course year think assumed able satisfy yous birth cohort alone would billion euro talk launching additional market perhaps help u dream little beyfortus revenue year thankspaul hudson ok help dream little moment graham first well maybe tolebrutinib houmanhouman ashrafian global head research development start paul break song going tolebrutinib thanks question graham deeply thoughtful always first part question scenario know bunch scenario two relapsingremitting trial running gemini ii got think going permutation scenario challenging let let dimensionalize across indication firstly term relapse remitting make excellent point previous failure particularly comparison let remind everybody briefly call term penetration across csf physical property actually biological property seen tolebrutinib outclassed case two log order molecule space even ibrutinibs primary biological capability substantial second point remind talk mechanism compared competitor patient come standard care go tolebrutinib continuing reduction neurofilament light two parameter make u optimistic yet cautious role tolebrutinib relapsing progressive point one point two term specific question asked endpoint course right arr currently endpoint choice however community physician looking patient point fact actually composite confirmed disability progression much important patient indeed many endpoint currently use relapsed independent progression rate short answer question see get gemini ii would strongly suggest regulator patient care deeply disease progression wellpowered address question progressive disease substantially hopeful data discussed course aubagio comparator arm population think provides nice wrapup tolebrutinib going hand brian thatbrian foard global business unit head specialty care yeah think question price really question value think anything else start differentiated program think m sure tolebrutinib program see scenario hard guess today final scenario likely determine value based upon comment price probably particular point nowpaul hudson thank brian thomas beyfortus supplythomas triomphe global business unit head vaccine exciting speak beyfortus first seen strong performance q start reminding point significant amount sale million euro q mentioning highlight fact cover nh last shipment northern hemisphere also first shipment southern hemisphere two south hemisphere country started first part seen also

comment mean clear want put spot strong rebound color givefrancois roger chief financial officer brian tell want quantify eps confident think building block starting growth profile today put aside already even see first quarter exceptional item negative one like aubagio comparison base covid sale example already strong platform term growth today give fair illustration think early quantify today would like give guidance point timepaul hudson thank houman oxligandhouman ashrafian global head research development yeah let respond briefly presented data earlier super excited data three point rather biologic large number patient likely extremely safe particularly compared anything else highly well tolerated dosing interval extremely interesting importantly offdrug disease suppression important three comment make one said optimistic optimistic optimistic may also opportunity echoed external commentator potential reduce atopic march progression disease particularly earlier atopic disease point one number one bullish reason number two mechanistically kind interesting address th well th th pathway impact broad ethnic population number two derisked perspective number three clearly taking forward multiplicity indication read year quick answer question driving study hard got four phase flight drive completion orderly manner possible bear mind biologic feel optimistic able quantify risk benefitspaul hudson great thank next questionoperatoryes next question emily field barclays emilyemily field barclays analyst hi thanks taking question first piggybacking earlier dupixent launch copd answer contrasting thought biologic ramp going take time pulmonologists familiar dupixent obviously thinking launch one going require great deal incremental promotional spend

perhaps even eight weekly reduced around think could new level two market clearly going convenience versus efficacy trade think going wellpositioned next questionoperatoryes next question emmanuel papadakis deutsche bankemmanuel papadakis deutsche bank analyst thank taking question maybe question cash flow first please francois mentioned caution outlook year think mentioned onetime adjustment prioryear rebating perhaps could give u bit color maybe absolute sense cash flow last year around billion euro free cash flow billion euro thinking year rather outsized restructuring cost q million euro likely land full year proportion cash lot capital working capital outflow q drove negative cash operation also rather unusual comment around would helpful quick one teased flat quarter row still
