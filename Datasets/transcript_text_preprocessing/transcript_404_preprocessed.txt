leo mariani roth mkm please go aheadleo mariani roth mkm analyst hi guy wanted address yous gas production guidance seems like pretty wide range know year versus oil number know quite bit tighter wanted get sense know kind concerted effort eogs behalf perhaps know alter timing turning line course year maybe try avoid know weak know month gas price potentially try bring know volume know closer next winter thought macro gas term kind timing term seeing gas price play hereezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yes leo ezra thanks question yeah would say know expect dorado similar treatment last year mean start already reduced activity level dorado reducing rig activity flexible like last year completion bringing well throughout year respect natural gas market think talking gas growth gas guide company general bring good point look yous gas growth q exit rate know midpoint guide really seeing million day domestic gas growth little bit unique year amount gas growth actually seeing trinidad actually contributing significant amount gas growth company level q exit rate midpoint guide trinidad seeing millionaday growth rate little bit unique guy know got consistent program trinidad middle drilling campaign year also still construction platform plan placing end year unique thing trinidad course current supply demand fundamental gas quite frankly almost opposite seeing domestically yous country last decade used robust supply natural gas last decade decreasing find really undersupplied natural gas side domestic need course sell gas currently domestic market pricing know slightly advantaged make project competitive rest domestic portfolio outside yous gas growth really majority million day really associated gas coming liquid rich oil playsleo mariani roth mkm analyst ok helpful maybe jumping gear prb obviously important know play guy emphasized last couple year see additional utica activity year look like pulling back little bit prb maybe little bit know kind surprising think got fewer well term completion year versus last assume still trying progress science learning play maybe add little color know modest pullback jeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah leo jeff yeah great point know lot great success talked opening comment mowry program know seeing increase overall productivity target know year year oil boe really u getting package development corridor really understanding offset parent package additional activity though also able really accumulate data drilling mowry well overlying niobrara going shift gear little bit since able refine geologic model going go ahead start testing package development shallower niobrara formation right along primary infrastructure corridor really look program slight step back mowry little bit focus kind really figure geologic model niobrara get package production performance activity equally split really kind mowry niobrara formation simpler delaware basin know really developed bottom know similar codevelopment strategy really maximize value assetoperatorthe next question come neal dingmann truist security please go aheadneal dingmann truist security analyst good morning thanks time guy first question utica oil play wondering continuing add acreage sound like maybe recently added secondly play far west black oil window confidence daysbilly helm president yeah neal billy helm continued look opportunity pick acreage see know reminder overall acreage acquisition cost probably around acre low cost entry especially consider compared lot opportunity deploy capital pleased organic approach continue trend try pick acreage accreted position far far west confident continuing test play reminder look think slide investor deck think slide illustrates play extends mile north south far got handful well production data grow year add another plus minus well pleased activity seen result seen still got lot testing across mile span seeing data tell u go little bit west yet prove give result start seeing performance well future still remaining extremely excited potential playneal dingmann truist security analyst yeah look forward got going secondly ofs material specifically past guy done great job know using strong balance sheet obviously stockpile pipe material wondering speak currently building inventory level believe future price could fall know guess running real timejeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah neal jeff yeah always tend carry somewhere know sixmonth year inventory really give u advantage kind strike opportunistic purchase think one thing look year really primary driver seeing know far deflation really going tubular cost expecting kind know really credit know procurement team able really find really opportunistic time able buy pipe go ahead add inventory able see price drop throughout know year thing would say really drop seeing ancillary service really supporting kind drilling completion know see kind drop support service coal tubing wireline cement seeing movement inflationary front think overall tubular standpoint great position operatorthe next question come doug leggate bank america please go aheaddoug leggate bank america merrill lynch analyst thanks good morning everyone hope everyone well busy earnings season ezra always appreciate always appreciate free cash flow visibility guy trying give u last quarter particular looking slide however got growth year presumably growth future year plan question look cumulative free cash flow simple math look like free cash flow flatlining period despite growth wonder could give u color capex go along end period sustaining capital would reset given larger volume would timeezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yeah doug thanks question ezra yeah cumulative free cash flow threeyear period threeyear scenario highlighted slide roughly higher previous three year see expanding margin threeyear scenario unfortunately given specific detail really getting talked talked november talked conference november maintenance capital number currently know midpoint variety different scenario know multibasin organic growth company like maintenance capital kind range depends trying keep oil flat equivalent flat really focused know maintaining production actually investing additional exploration infrastructure thing nature look roll threeyear scenario since growing volume right maintenance capital trending little bit also going offset real world deflationary factor moving toward u throughout threeyear plan would say know see free cash flow flatlining fact see cash flow free cash flow per share compound annual growth rate across threeyear scenariodoug leggate bank america merrill lynch analyst helpful take another look buyback certainly help hope followup little bit random perhaps clearly seems utica dorado know help grow gas one rig dorado given strong volume obviously seems mix kind shifting little bit time think also talked november question expect next step organic strategy eog think would little specific fair amount speculation guy looking hard canada montney know think organic growth could move direction leave thank youezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yeah doug know quote bit random question know always organically exploring thing know regard canadian asset know number year ago strategically exited asset real heart question know way think strategy u captured tremendous resource south texas dorado natural gas play building lowcost gas business really sits alongside core oil investment think capital allocation necessarily allocating capital gas rather oil really looking asset play independently best thing company continue drive breakevens continue build value shareholder regard utica emerging asset lot way premium double premium return threshold make u little bit ambivalent agnostic actual hydrocarbon type producing thing really returnbased question layer macro environment need consideration going forward gas market year definitely look little bit soft touched little leo question top qa still remain constructive yous domestic gas market say month lng demand continues come announcement made today see plan part solution going forwardoperatorthe next question come scott hanold rbc please go aheadscott hanold rbc capital market analyst yeah thanks hey ezra eog share led peer multiple basin aggregate performance know even remember past go commanded pretty good multiple premium everyone else kind curious shown willingness appetite step buyback

officer yes scott good question think know think buyback think best way create longterm shareholder value right seen multiple compress seen really multiple compress across industry think look know weighting energy sp approximately maybe little bit close forecasted earnings think sit currently would say dislocated environment regard think move forward know generate significant amount free cash flow year minimum commitment shareholder return free cash flow shareholder could anticipate form buyback right look back done historically buyback know active first half year real dramatic dislocation would say regional banking crisis debt ceiling conversation thing like example take step back buyback q oil price rose throughout quarter obviously share price appreciation well fourth quarter volatility entering sector continued multiple compression across industry across eog obviously stepped back think think strength company continue improve think see threeyear scenario continue expand free cash flow potential company continue generating high return think really like said currently would consider dislocated environmentscott hanold rbc capital market analyst ok appreciate color pivot threeyear outlook kind know parlay permian activity provided chart permian showed mix well know increasing know overall cumulative production know touch lower oil know guy lot codevelopment talk trend know investor expect like mix shift going forward within threeyear outlookjeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah scott jeff thanks question yeah going completing know wolfcamp well program know part plan normal cadence development move section section move section develop one interval know one thing need identify whether good barrier upper wolfcamp know go ahead develop target independently many area going developing wolfcamp year really optimal codevelop two target together strategic really minimize kind depletion section maximize value one target reminder know wolfcamp associated wolfcamp associated gas also prolific oil producer got premium return well payout eight month know goal permian kind stacked pay basin always going continue execute codevelopment strategy really focus maximizing return npv sorry think said know meant programoperatorthe next question come neil mehta goldman sachs please go aheadneil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah thanks ezra team first question going back macro think surprised supply natural gas yous course last six month one area associated permian supply ezra would love perspective see evolving especially well mature maybe yous production decline side tie way thinking midcycle view gasezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yeah thanks neil good point think continue see know model year know yous growth might start since going talking associated gas really question know roughly around barrel total liquid know roughly say barrel along crude oil obviously significant amount going coming permian general basin little bit higher gor historic oil play like eagle ford bakken think continue see model would suggest continue see increase associated gas likely bit differential struggle waha take consideration thinking development dorado like said forecast supply demand forecast future gas midcycle gas price without recognition happening oil side one thing make forecasting gas difficult ultimate thing way manage business trying grow know gas asset concert oil play really think absolute lowcost producer one reason seen u know ramp aggressively dorado asset one reason seen u last year year moderate activity captured significant resource think geographically located place give u significant advantage invested additional infrastructure including dorado pipeline named verde going give u margin expansion life asset really way focusing know developing pure gas asset really concert growing future north american demand dominantly driven lng along gulf coastneil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks ezra followup different strategy many peer seen much consolidation unconventional space last year got much organic approach guess wanted give opportunity talk investor base think right strategy plus minus come strategyezra yacob chairman chief executive officer yeah well know talked focused creating shareholder value cycle consistent way able generate value organic exploration focus lowcost operation commitment capital discipline know high level confidence existing portfolio aimed improving financial performance company think see expanded margin expanded free cash flow threeyear scenario provided underpinned billion barrel equivalent premium resource meaningful upside resource future conversion future exploration also utica resource already captured begun discussing think organic exploration effort firstmover advantage three emerging asset dorado north powder sorry powder river basin utica know three individual asset ability represent know equivalent smaller midsized ep company quite frankly know dorado acre approximately tcf captured powder river basin multiple target across acre utica asset acre continue focus improving inventory expanding know unproven resource think trade wider discount day proven resource focused continuing prove drive cost asset bring forward create value shareholdersoperatorthe next question come bob brackett bernstein research please go aheadbob brackett alliancebernstein analyst good morning thinking utica look day cube put reasonable price volume compare reasonable well cost look quite impressive maybe old era would lead flagdropping huge ramp activity volume something governing pace develop utica maybe corporate strategy maybe gas takeaway maybe getting cost well ever see sort offtotheraces ramp saw old day emerging shale playsbilly helm president yeah bob billy yeah thanks recognition utica excited play performance well tested across play seemed continue beat meet beat top curve pleased given lot detail cost yet continue drive cost increased efficiency gain know early play lot testing lot science gathering data expect see cost come really given lot color yet eur well yet either handful well limited production data want gather time give answer guess still feel confident previous estimate finding cost range look strong still committed top far ramp expect see continuing gather data get confidence diligent want choose ramp costefficient way develop asset simply need ramp single asset aggressively see u mean advantage multibasin portfolio required grow meet certain target one asset flexibility provides u grow gradually pace learning outrun learning curve efficient operator basinsbob brackett alliancebernstein analyst maybe never huge incentive shareholder base go tell hey go build gas pipe takeaway ramp thing barrel day might never see sort huge level growth previous erabilly helm president yeah think would see level growth saw past think strategy would grow pace commensurate understanding resource best develop long term shareholder bring value forward best want destroy value either running fast balance want develop pace commensurate understanding assetoperatorthe next question come roger read well fargo security please go aheadroger read well fargo security analyst yeah thanks good morning would like come back little bit well efficiency know kind well cost look versus longer lateral length think occurring right mentioned multibasin right lateral improvement increase coming mostly delaware spread across operation know either opportunity limitation expansion lateral lengthsjeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah roger jeff thanks question lateral length pretty big driver efficiency gain know opportunity test longer lateral last year pretty much throughout multibasin portfolio good success based know basically drilling longer applicable based acreage footprint one limiting factor run know san antonio talked know year year drilling moved east know little bit robust geology west little lesser geology able really optimize economics utilizing longer lateral know really pushing completion technique improve operational capital efficiency continuing year seeing extension eagle ford know utica talked delineation mile oil fairway starting move know spacing package package development majority well going three mile moving forward increase overall lateral length company midland know testing threemile lateral last couple year really high volume last year drilled four five seen really good success able know find correct block place work acreage going increase mile lateral midland kind roll across company know overall lateral length versus program know talked know efficiency gain lateral length seeing stuff billy talked drilling completion side know going require four le rig two le frac fleet also four le net well still going completing similar amount total lateral length program way would look riding lot momentum efficiency lateral length coming continue look build roger read well fargo security analyst thanks lot question turn back thereoperatorthe next question come matthew portillo tph please go aheadmatt portillo tudor pickering holt company analyst good morning followup question marketing side permian specifically highlight ability build gas processing plant lower cost structure curious see fairway longhaul gas takeaway permian next year know matterhorn start clear basin toward end feel like remains pretty tight plus curious role eog might play longhaul takeaway permian relates potentially taking incremental capacity make sure gas able flowlance terveen senior vice president marketing yeah matthew good morning lance maybe start yeah think kind macro right matterhorn coming pipe expanded like horsepower right kind see going know going see base going continue kind wide moving year probably potentially next year would want really highlight continued leader think like transportation portfolio part many pipe actually early pushing lot pipe make sure pretty significant transportation portfolio gas also crude oil natural gas standpoint longhaul pipe eog standpoint wellpositioned bcf day residue takeaway hit think great market along gulf coastmatt portillo tudor pickering holt company analyst great maybe followup question wanted come back powder highlighting obviously opportunity delineate niobrara think carry oilier horizon curious learning far term drilling environment know trying drive well cost big part improving economics well productivity uplift talked pause overall program thinking potentially pull capital permanently toward utica going forwardjeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah matt jeff would look pause necessarily program think shift gathered really good data great result mowry target know great efficiency gain cost improvement plan always able gather really robust datasets line go ahead step niobrara little bit know back package mowry know niobrara far know mowry drilling aspect little bit different niobrara going little bit easier drilling would say compared mowry mowry deeper also bentonite get caught issue niobrara hand know clinoforms really mapped clinoforms well find better producer really want strategic mark across acreage make sure staying right clinoforms think really disciplined pace looking powderoperatorthe next question come john freeman raymond james please go aheadjohn freeman raymond james analyst thanks lot followup scott asked earlier regarding sort development delaware basin know obviously clear taking longterm strategy way developed codevelopment strategy multiple target opposed sort know cherry picking oil gas weaker look like know targeted interval wolfcamp oil combo moved around lot kind year get far ahead since give threeyear outlook would safe assume thinking sort shift little bit back toward oiler zone nature way codeveloping packagejeff leitzell executive vice president chief operating officer yeah john great question yeah pretty much hit head know really flex move kind across acreage know different section geology change see look last four year really see flex back forth moving section section codevelopment strategy strategically codeveloping bottom top yeah flex kind next handful year see threeyear scenariojohn freeman raymond james analyst great followup look infrastructure project obviously year stepped dorado delaware think like something like utica combo going continue get scale grow assume kind infrastructure bucket within capex total capex sort stay kind level year percentage budget potentially go higher looking kind threeyear outlook kind emerging play like dobilly helm president yeah john billy let answer couple different way guess infrastructure spend address real upfront discrete project offer longterm support play going developed multiple decade know specific direction infrastructure project continue lower cost play company going forward expand margin long long period time utica adequate processing capacity seeing kind project opportunity company think going looking largely gathering process gathering line area develop play typical normal play see need point develop large strategic infrastructure area would expect see time infrastructure stay normal capital
