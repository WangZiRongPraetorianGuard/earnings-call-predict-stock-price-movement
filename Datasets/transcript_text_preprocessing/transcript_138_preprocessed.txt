yearsharlan sur jp morgan analyst thank youoperatorwell take next question cj muse cantor fitzgerald please go ahead line opencj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst good afternoon thanks taking question guess first question nearterm question mix expect june pretty massive shift foundrylogic memory guess part speak underlying driver within see perhaps pickup domestic china memory beyond june quarter think prior quarter talked revenue rec pushed june quarter curious moving part therebren higgins chief financial officer yeah would say far china memory go first half heavy second half positive conversation customer memory front rick indicated term longterm plan seeing business improve seeing profitability cash flow starting improve expect significant investment move rest year nothing could change think profile might tick little bit second half overall nonchina see changing real meaningful way look back business little bit maybe logicfoundry think going right around think going pretty similar overall mix yearcj muse cantor fitzgerald analyst excellent term commentary around accelerating topline revenue throughout remainder calendar guess speak main driver relates perhaps twonanometer pilot logic arizona handsetrelated epc really driving sort percentage growth rate thinking half half thanks muchbren higgins chief financial officer yes cj think covered right see early investment twonanometer threenanometer buildout investment mentioned arizona pretty good logicfoundry segment right look overall business first half versus second half think second half high single digit versus first half ballpark guiding think going end range progress year epc front think little bit stronger seasonality epc first part year see improvement think move second half year wellrick wallace chief executive officer course service growing quarter quarter got effect welloperatorand take next question krish sankar td cowen please go ahead line openkrish sankar td cowen analyst yes thanks taking question two one bren last quarter kind said kla overall calendar revenue could grow midsingle digit based wfe obviously expectation wfe growth going higher thanks indiscernible given exposure side kind curious think overall revenue profile year year year followupbren higgins chief financial officer yes look wfe level talked flat modestly think depends view wfe everybody add differently view wfe probably billion billion slightly flat slightly term looking year think way think simply put given wfe le flat modestly going see increase service talked going see modest improvement epc seen improvement given outperformance saw march incremental guide june semipc business think overall semiepc share overall market probably going fairly consistent maybe little bit saw translates semiepc business roughly performing mostly line think market going yearkrish sankar td cowen analyst got helpful quick followup china give long lead time kind curious think china say memory would filtrated overall china revenue along path back fpd gross margin march june basis point qoq said product mix mainly china kind curious thank youbren higgins chief financial officer yes mostly product mix quarter quarter fpd adjustment related inventory took related decision mostly product mix across semipc business growth service quarter quarter service dilutive overall gross margin believe accretive operating margin gross margin little dilutive rest normal product mix across portfolio different margin profile across portfolio depending revenue given quarter cause fluctuation think guidance range appropriate like saw think guided somewhere around last quarter came depending thing end revenueing engage customer ship system always room upside give range give nothing really particular actual customer product mix region product mix product shipping getting acceptance onkrish sankar td cowen analyst china fitment rest year similar range orbren higgins chief financial officer china interesting think probably flattish course year second half le flattish first half mix changing bit term end market mix see percent total coming see growth year coming nonchina customerskrish sankar td cowen analyst thank muchoperatorwell take next question brian chin stifel please go ahead line openbrian chin stifel financial corp analyst hi thanks letting u ask question guess sort asked earlier chip act announcement continuing roll solidified timing magnitude u greenfields build maybe latest thinking projectsrick wallace chief executive officer well yeah many announcement exciting see look timing project even example one announced today new york one quite way think approval funding relative timing customer talk excited chance reshore u still building capacity based market demand really affect overall capacity investment gauging based overall demand think happens size investment term many wafer start go point driven market would stick comment see business environment relatively independent location customer choosing make investmentsbrian chin stifel financial corp analyst got fair maybe notice shareholder letter call highlighted advanced packaging revenue could around million calendar growth rate represent versus calendar would size served addressable market advanced packaging know certainly cross guess boundary across portfoliobren higgins chief financial officer yes greater somewhere around little close expectation across broad portfolio right process control sell customer inspection metrology also process tool specialty semiconductor business term contribution part portfolio think go forward feel pretty excited opportunity see growth rate meaningfully faster wferick wallace chief executive officer yeah think opportunity couple factor play one speed customer accelerating packaging effort degree requiring leading edge ability make make sense business standpoint packaging challenge really need leading edge still number packaging application market served lowerend competitor really competing quickly new technology come increased conversation meeting leading customer last year already talked accelerating think hard judge exactly growth rate point pretty clear huge demand many customer view competitive necessity order much race getting new capability market especially pertains ai application would say huge driver customer engaged lot request new capability come u developing solution conjunction customer meet demand stand right outgrow wfe think potential go well beyond depending adoption go continue execute itbrian chin stifel financial corp analyst great thanks coloroperatorwell take next question tim arcuri ubs please go ahead line opentim arcuri ubs analyst thanks lot wanted ask n rick lot talk recently big volume n going probably although certainly customer crypto customer ramp capacity get installed next year guess question much driver think n specifically business seeing yet backhappening year thing asking timing start help businessrick wallace chief executive officer yeah great question definitely one conversation critical customer timing seen part optimism going forward conversation pulled term need customer feeling end market pull think right bulk highest volume kla already seeing conversation start see meaningful business order coming toward end customer figure thing seeing number advanced design start twonanometer node big tim big powerfavorable node lot customer challenge around data center frankly around ai powerrelated term customer able even build site big driver customer right think n going significant node going definitely see lot already seeing activity big factor go tim arcuri ubs analyst got got ok perfect want ask china bren said think said china going flattest shorter back half year mean sound like every quarter china keep getting stronger think going downtick going take tool long allowed take tool question really mix around china back half filling bit new customer mean probably new hub built part compilation different name new newly named fabs coming sort filling back half year seen lot headline around potential entity list addition happens lot headline happen downside thinking back half year next year thanksbren higgins chief financial officer well tim want speculate hypothetical might come come u government regard export control continuing work closely government spend lot time resource make sure whatever rule compliant pretty decent mix talked dram think wafer infrastructure second half think wafer infrastructure probably little bit second half think reticle infrastructure probably logicfoundry overall net basically flattish profile customer mix number new project continuing take system also call mature legacy customer china also part mix think continuing healthy think year think profile even beyond year feel like kind continues le current level obviously like half half mean given quarter see movement see thing todaytim arcuri ubs analyst ok awesome thank brenoperatorwell take next question c needham please go ahead line opencharles shi needham company analyst thanks want ask question build discussed team earlier tsmc definitely said revenue going ramp n kind alluded think volume higher look nanometer ramp look like occurs one year term production timeline threenanometer higher volume guy compared probably really wonder fact said think high volume compared coming discussion customer changed time want kind mean move capacity little bit closer high volume point entry highvolume production thanksrick wallace chief executive officer yes great question couple thing consider thinking n first clear customer mind race ai capability see several design start happening one familiar player designing capability different demand environment also constrained capacity environment constrained somewhat even ability build facility last factor kla phenomenon get pulled early frontend loaded facility need system able qualify rest different node seen quite factor meet customer concerned supporting demand seeing believe going get lot pressure support end calendar year start supporting po going see plan node go talking volume toward end seeing business course know much broader going get term number design start remarkable many design specifically one application point process pretty remarkably consistent talk different customer even customerscharles shi needham company analyst thanks color maybe second question want ask advanced packaging capability building sound like constructive conversation customer maybe put kla advanced process control capability packaging side process control get overall idea really hope provide little bit color kind area think customer facing challenge term maybe wrapping coas maybe wrapping soic see process control perspective biggest opportunity kla thanksrick wallace chief executive officer yes give color two story one year ago bought icos part theory case giving u exposure back end remember meeting one big customer backend people literally said guy talking u backend kla market fast forward end last year calendar year meeting ahmad critical customer two topic wanted talk one support euv ramping continuous ramping euv design capability advanced packaging folk historically traditionally responsible front end one thing said think guy capability lot frontend tool need modified need back end back end critical part differentiation part need work u take consider front end tool make concerned cost often case beginning node concerned capability necessarily cost dynamic shifted pretty considerably go one biggest driver work going ai look success requirement advanced packaging part solution driving kind anticipated year ago trend going become relevant seeing specifically customer bringing frontend people worked front end work backend challenge asking specifically capability front end used back end case done inspection tool capability know make modification handling operating condition make work definitely seeing case ability support modify system gating item u realize revenue demand demand competitive standpoint uniquely positioned feel pretty good opportunity major focus area companycharles shi needham company analyst thanks muchoperatorwell take next question chris caso wolfe research please go ahead line openchris caso wolfe research analyst yeah thank good evening followup question regard memory think understand saying regard year perhaps improvement nonchina memory nothing significant guess customer telling prepared perhaps going next year starting see price go utilization expectation potential improvement bren higgins chief financial officer yeah chris seeing thing want see right seeing pricing improve customer taking utilization utilization low fair amount capacity seeing profitability improve ultimately translate cash flow expect investment next year think seeing dram driven leading edge dram expect see course driver related high bandwidth memory think way device market part market improving year translate investment next yearchris caso wolfe research analyst got followup regard service think last quarter talked expectation kind high end target still right way thinking seen utilization rate improve make change view service come yearbren higgins chief financial officer well certainly factor growth seeing year pretty open thought would somewhere million incremental service year versus think closer top end range bottom factor given nature process control complexity system mix relatively lower volume customer tend rely u ensure optimizing capital particularly environment capital constrained yield matter lot utilization never drop much process tool redundancy seeing continue improve think good sign term overall market health confidence growth driver next yearchris caso wolfe research analyst thank youoperatorwell take next question joe quatrochi well fargo please go ahead line openjoe quatrochi well fargo security analyst yes thanks taking question wondering could comment obviously seem pretty positive term opportunity looking

clear mean product already front end used back end started ago seeing accelerated conversation tool customer actually name specific tool want much depends tool give range could three month could couple year depending whether modifying something already used kind application specializing really depends think already part million tool front end fair amount probably half actually process capability spts really example also case tool need upgraded later specification customer move forward technology know netnet positive growth segment u think continue grow bren talked growth last year big driver going back time orbotech acquisition belief packaging opportunity going continue grow toolspecific long take modifybren higgins chief financial officer also new product going support substrate transition substrate integrates package inspection side line space shrink connecting layer drive need capability advanced inspection metrology system anytime add sensitivity add capability tends throughput volume hit creates opportunity u sell higher asp system capability going maintain sampling rate need system factor term factor positive term think longterm opportunitiestom omalley barclays analyst super helpful second one kind tidbit given year said second half first half high single digit talked kind mix foundrylogic similar calendar year take clue obviously see really strong growth memory second half could help u color obviously march june dram percentage went bit term contribution memory second half thinking dram nand growth profile thank youbren higgins chief financial officer yes think think going know little bit stronger potentially second half first much like said earlier expected dram investment china would expect second half lower first halfoperatoroperator instruction take next question srini pajjuri raymond james please go ahead line opensrini pajjuri raymond james analyst sorry joined little late question already asked apologize think last quarter bren customer pushout kind impacted revenue year wondering change update customer including current year guidancebren higgins chief financial officer yeah affected march quarter shifting around frankly affected little bit december quarter march quarter shifting around make december quarter work obviously shortfall march think anything really changed expect see much activity customer get mean look thing could change could see surprise right least planning point view put pull great support itsrini pajjuri raymond james analyst got thank twonanometer think foundry customer transitioning aggressively get around obviously help time think euv layer count going somewhat flattish wondering sort impact process control intensity go ga keep guess euv kind flattish term layer expect impact kind nonevent yourick wallace chief executive officer oh event mean customer definitely think dynamic customer want add process control intensity avoid also want ramp yield tradeoff prototyping stage early pilot inspect measure order debug process ramp question much maintain ramp really drive process control definitely using capability front end area going increase sampling measurement keep additional challenge smaller design role also new capability bring finfet talked past modification gen optical inspector able support finfet change process euv layer matter process integration challenge still going model though see increase different scenario much process control intensity go consistent think modest increase overall process control intensity leader successfully three nanometer anybody else try jump node though see dramatic increase process control intensity benefit learning done three volume aggregate depending many people supporting time drive intensity customer also expecting robust design environment certainly first year saw threenanometer likely steeper ramp addition challenge gate around architecture mean inspection also metrology also volume earlier steeper ramp robust design environment challenge customer process integration see design encouraged number frontssrini pajjuri raymond james analyst got thank youoperatorwell take another question krish sankar td cohen please go ahead line openkrish sankar td cowen analyst hi thanks followup rick followup gate around clearly exposure gen optical inspection metrology highk metal gate way quantify think gate allaround revenue could calendar rick wallace chief executive officer yes would making krish mean really look way think node requirement standpoint think n would attribute gate around think node intensity process control blended said prior answer slightly specific number specifically around gate around obviously big driver change customer pushing n know yet consistent model see rising process control intensity corresponding increase per share klakrish sankar td cowen analyst got helpful could squeeze one kind curious gen lead time think last time said like seven nine month change assume mature node kind slowing china might moderate year progress view lead time coming still like seven nine monthsrick wallace chief executive officer gen highly demanded across node configurable system fact recently introduced nonupgradable version specifically gate around product lot extendability challenged term supply ability get supply meet demand would say see increase year revenue system hurt u last year able get incremental supply around key component see increase year help still think lead time probably month month range product although lot juggling make sure position support customer demand multiple front think testament extendability favorability broadband system ability scale deployment length meet different inspection requirement across multiple nodesbren higgins chief financial officer thank krish think krish referring said gen seven ninemonth quarterago brand know gen change gen ballpark still ballpark perfect right brings u end call want
