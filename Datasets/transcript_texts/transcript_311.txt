Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2023 earnings conference call. We are thrilled to report another quarter of data results for the fourth quarter of 2023, closing out the year on a strong note. Despite the challenges and opportunities present in the external environment, we have adeptly navigated the prevailing trend of efficiency enhancement and cost reduction in the freight industry. By embracing the digital transformation of China's growth rate sector, we have positioned ourselves as the leader in online, digital, and intelligent logistics solutions, effectively replacing traditional offline logistics with our core cost saving advantage. Through continuous enhancements to our product features and operating efficiency, we successfully deepened our penetration among direct shippers. We are committed to becoming the preferred shipping gateway for tens of millions of small- and medium-sized shippers, empowering enterprises with greater logistics competitiveness and improved profitability. [Foreign language] In the fourth quarter, we witnessed steady improvements across key operational metrics: expanding user base, product operations, transportation capacity supply, and one-stop services. Our average shipper MAUs reached an all-time high of 2.24 million, representing nearly 19% year-over-year growth. Notably, the scale of direct shippers continued to increase during the fourth quarter, with their proportion of fulfilled orders surpassing 45% for the first time, reflecting a significant shift toward more efficient and cost-effective online channels. For product operations, we further refined and streamlined the shipping and efficient fulfillment product features for new direct shippers, facilitating their onboarding and driving robust growth. With respect to truckers' supply, we upgraded our tiered trucker rating system, consistently optimizing transaction efficiency through incentive-driven offerings and precise matching while continuously expanding the supply of truckers and elevating users' stickiness. Additionally, for our one-stop service, our value-added services such as freight brokerage service, credit solutions and insurance, energy services, and ETC saw continued penetration [Inaudible] with our transportation business to enhance user satisfaction and stickiness. These achievements further boosted our network effect growth momentum, catalyzing the road freight -- market shift from traditional offline models to an innovative, efficient, and digitalized future. [Foreign language] Our strong business growth translated into exceptional financial performance with revenues growing by 25.3% year over year to RMB 2.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased by 64.4% year over year to RMB 733 million. Going forward, we remain committed to optimizing our revenue mix and enhancing monetization efficiency to create greater value for our shareholders. In February 2024, the fourth meeting of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs emphasized the importance of effectively reducing logistics costs throughout society. As logistics serve as the backbone of the real economy, it continues to garner increased attention and support. Within this strategic landscape, by leveraging digitalized logistics offerings, we are confident in leveraging digital logistics to further enhance logistics efficiency and reduce costs, creating greater value for both the industry and our users. [Foreign language] Thank you. Let me pass the call over to our CFO, Simon, who will provide an update on our fourth quarter business progress and the financial results.Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Mr. Zhang, and thanks everyone for making time to join our earnings conference call today. I will now provide an overview of our operational highlights and financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023. We concluded the year with strong operational and financial results in the fourth quarter. Our fulfilled orders experienced a remarkable 40.4% year-over-year growth, driving quarterly average daily fulfilled orders to an all-time high. Despite the impact of the adverse weather conditions, fourth quarter order growth again outpaced the overall freight market, propelled by sustained scale expansion and increased activity of both shipper and trucker users. We set a new record in fulfillment rate at approximately 32% in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 8 percentage points year over year and more than 3 percentage points quarter over quarter. From a supply demand perspective, the quarter's increased supply of truckers improved matching efficiency across various transaction types, including negotiated orders, tap-and-go orders, entrusted shipments, and including long-haul, full truckload, less-than-truckload, and short haul by distance range. Operationally, we can continue to make progress with our tiered trucker operations strategy during the quarter. Initiatives such as our Saving Package 2.0 and truckers deposits helped strengthen our tiered truck rating management and enhanced fulfillment quality of truckers, thereby boosting retention among high-frequency active truckers. In terms of order structure, we sustained the growth momentum of direct shippers from the third quarter with direct shippers contributing more than 45% of total fulfilled orders in the fourth quarter. We expect direct shippers' order contribution will continue to grow as their penetration increases, leading to additional improvements in our platform's overall order fulfillment efficiency. Regarding our user base, our average shipper MAUs reached a historic high of 2.24 million in the fourth quarter, up 18.7% year over year and 4.9% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by the rapid growth of our nonmember low-frequency direct shippers. Meanwhile, our 1,688 and 688 member shippers activity levels remained essentially stable year over year given all type types of shippers, whether it's professional shipper or direct shipper, have incentives looking for efficient shipping channels to lower their logistics costs. We expect this trend to continue, with robust growth in our shipper user base, through the year of 2024, primarily from low- and medium-frequency direct shippers. Our platform's strong and growing network effect drove parallel growth in both our trucker base and activity during the quarter. For example, the number of active truckers fulfilling orders through our platform over the past 12 months rose to 3.88 million. In addition, we maintained our shipper member 12-month rolling retention rate, as well as our next month's retention of truckers who responded to orders on a sequential basis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues from our online transaction commission amounted to RMB 644.8 million, up 44% year over year. This growth was fueled by a solid expansion in the number of fulfilled orders and the heightened commission penetration. Our commission model currently covered more than 59% of fulfilled orders and generated an average commission per transaction of RMB 23.7 during the quarter. It is important to note that, historically, we did not include revenues from our intracity commission model in online transaction commission revenues. Therefore, intracity transactions were also included when calculating our commission penetration, resulting in an underestimation of our overall commission model coverage. Moving forward, starting from 2024, we will rename our transaction commission revenue stream to transaction services, which consists of all monetization from truckers relating to freight matching services, including the revenue generated from our intracity business that was previously classified under the freight listing and value-added services in order to better reflect the company's latest development status and the business nature of our revenues. Next, a brief update on our share repurchase program. From November 20, 2023 to March 6, 2024, we repurchased approximately 7.9 million ADS shares, totaling approximately $52.7 million. Since we announced the program, we have repurchased a total of around 30.7 million ADS shares from the open market with a total value of approximately $200 million. Now, our 2023 fourth quarter and year-end financial results. In the interest of time, I will be presenting abbreviated highlights only. We encourage you to refer to our press release issued earlier today for complete details. Total revenues for full year 2023 were RMB 8.4 billion, representing a 25.3% increase year over year. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were RMB 2.4 billion, representing a 25.3% increase year over year. Net revenues from freight matching services, including service fees from freight brokerage models, membership fees from listing models, and commissions from online transaction services, were RMB 7,048.8 million for the full year of 2023, up 24.6% from 2022, primarily due to the rapid growth in transaction commissions, as well as growing revenues from our freight brokerage service. Revenues from freight brokerage service reached RMB 3.9 billion for 2023, up 16.5% year over year. For the fourth quarter, net revenue increased by 19.2% to RMB 1.1 billion, primarily driven by an increase in transaction volume due to robust user demand. Revenue from freight listing service were RMB 929.4 million for the full year, up 9% year over year and rose 10.4% year over year in the fourth quarter to reach RMB 246.2 million, primarily due to a growing number of total paying members. Revenues from transaction commissions amounted to RMB 2.2 billion in 2023, representing a 52.6% increase year over year. For the fourth quarter last year, net revenues amounted to RMB 644.8 million, representing a 44% increase year over year, primarily driven by strong order volume growth, as well as higher per-order transaction commission. Revenues from value-added services were RMB 1.4 billion in 2023, representing a 28.8% increase year over year. For the fourth quarter, net revenues increased to 392.2 million, representing a 27.3% increase year over year, mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from credit solutions and other value-added services. Fourth quarter cost of revenues was RMB 1,152.3 million, compared with RMB 951.8 million in the prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in VAT, related tax surcharges, and other tax costs, and net of tax refunds from government authorities. These tax-related costs net of refund totaled RMB 1,015.3 million, representing an increase of 18.4% from RMB 857.4 million in the same period of 2022, primarily due to the increase -- due to the continued growth in transaction activities involving our freight brokerage service. Our sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 421 million, compared with RMB 281.1 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses for user acquisitions. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 266 million, compared with RMB 408.2 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower share-based compensation expenses and professional service fees. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 255.3 million, compared with RMB 252 -- 250.2 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses and increased investment in technology infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in salary and benefit expenses. Income from operations in the fourth quarter were RMB 250.8 million, compared with the loss of -- loss from operation of RMB 5.3 million in the same period of 2020 -- 2022. Net income in the fourth quarter was RMB 588.3 million, an increase of 200.6% from RMB 195.7 million in the same period of 2022. Under non-GAAP measures, our adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was RMB 398.8 million, an increase of 60.6% from RMB 248.4 million in the same period of 2022.

Non-GAAP adjusted basic net income per ADS were RMB 0.7 in the fourth quarter, compared with RMB 0.42 in the same period of 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per ADS were RMB 0.69 in the fourth quarter, compared with RMB 0.42 in the same period of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, long-term time deposit, and wealth management products totaled RMB 27.6 billion, compared with RMB 26.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. For our first quarter 2024 business outlook, we expect our total net revenues to be between RMB 2.11 billion and RMB 2.16 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 23.9% to 27.1%. And this forecast reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy as of the date hereof. That concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call to Q&A. Operator, please go ahead. Questions & Answers: OperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Ronald Keung with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst [Foreign language] Thank you, management, and -- for the sharing. I want to ask about fulfillment rate that we've seen the record fulfillment rate of 32% in the fourth quarter. What are the key drivers behind and -- with the year-on-year increase and the sequential increase as well and what is your expectation for fulfillment rate for 2024? Thank you.Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Ronald. In this quarter, we have seen a substantial improvement in the freight matching efficiency, which can be attributed to the rapid expansion of our user base on both ends and the scale effects generated as a result. So, with more active shippers on the platform, we attract new trucker registrations, ensuring a sufficient supply of transportation capacity to meet the diverse needs of shippers quickly. This dynamic cycle again leads to an influx of newly registered small and medium business owners. Specifically, the significant improvement in fulfillment rates in the fourth quarter was driven by a number of positive factors. Firstly, the average trucker daily active user who are responding to orders increased by approximately 13% year over year in the quarter, resulting in an increase in effective supply on the trucker side, further balancing the supply and demand, and therefore increasing the probability of successful matches. And secondly, ongoing optimization of the shipper structure also led to an improvement in matching capability. The contribution of fulfilled orders from direct shippers increased by 3 percentage points year over year to over 45%, enhancing the overall quality of order listing and the certainty of order fulfillment. Another key factor is the continued improvements of the platform's pricing capabilities. Through big data-based measurement, the platform can set reasonable recommended prices that are better aligned with the current market conditions and further increasing the likelihood of transaction completion. And additionally, we have continued to create remarkable value-adds to our users during the fulfillment process such as disputes, resolution, and user rating, all of which have also contributed to the increase in fulfillment rates. Looking into the coming year, we will continue to attract more shippers and truckers by utilizing a multilateral market approach to create and match more supply and demand, thereby maintaining a better balance between users on both sides. We'll also continue to encourage shippers to utilize transaction types such as entrusted shipment and tap-and-go, which more truckers are willing to respond to, while consistently optimizing the product function and improving data efficiency to drive even higher fulfillment rates. Also, as the user structure continuously shifts toward direct shippers, we also anticipated further improvement in the fulfillment rate. Thank you.Ronald Keung -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you, Simon.OperatorThe next question comes from Eddy Wang with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Eddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst [Foreign language] Thank you, management, for taking my question. My question is regarding the fulfilled orders. We noticed that there's a 40% year over year of the fulfillment -- fulfilled orders in the fourth quarter. And for the full year last year, they are around 33% year over year. So, this is significantly higher than the growth of the broad logistic market. So, what's the major driver behind the -- this strong growth and what's your expectation for the fulfilled order growth -- volume growth in 2024? Thank you.Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thank you, Eddy. Since last year, the online penetration of the freight matching industry has shown very consistent growth. Our platform has maintained strong order volume growth over the past year and mainly benefiting from the continued increase of new shippers, improved activity level of existing users, and continued improvement in matching efficiency as a result of operational strategy optimization. In the fourth quarter, we sustained our holistic user acquisition efforts across various channels, including app store, information streams, and FCM, among others. Additionally, our leading network effect brought us a large number of user -- new user registration through natural traffic. As of the end of December, we had an average of around 20,000 new shippers and 10,000 new truckers registering on our platform every day. Looking ahead to the coming year, we will continue to invest in branding and improve user acquisition efficiency by further exploring innovative user acquisition channels such as increasing offline truck stickers, advertisements, and promoting online programs. At the same time, we will optimize the conversion of registered users to active users through a series of effective operational tools. Also, this quarter brought more than just the growth of long-haul business. With our ongoing product functionality and operational efficiency optimizations, the less-than-truckload orders matched through our platform also grew rapidly in the past quarter. We believe that the online penetration rate of LTL remains considerably low at the moment, indicating there's still a huge market opportunity to be unlocked. As we look ahead into 2024, we will see new opportunities for growth as the trend toward direct shippers and LTL transactions continue to intensify. We anticipate continued high growth in our total fulfillment orders, not solely confined to the FTL market. Additionally, we anticipate making significant strides in new markets such as LTL and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. Thank you.Eddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Charlie Chen with China Renaissance. Please go ahead.Charlie Chen -- China Renaissance Securities -- Analyst [Foreign language] Could you please provide me with an update on freight listing services, specifically the trend in the number of subscribing shipper members during the fourth quarter? It seems that the revenue growth of freight listing has been slower compared to the fast growth of monthly active shippers. Could you please explain the main reason behind the growth rate discrepancy and provide us with an estimate of the expected membership growth for 2024? Thank you.Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. The number of shipper members remained largely stable in the fourth quarter with approximately 790,000 existing subscribing members as of December, a steady increase from last quarter-end. Our shipper members have demonstrated strong retention and engagement with a 12-month rolling retention rate of over 80% since 2023. The recent membership growth has been primarily driven by two factors. Firstly, we have already achieved a high penetration rate among professional shippers and we expect a number of shipper members from this segment to remain relatively stable in the future. Secondly, we have observed majority of the new shippers are low- and medium-frequency users and the number of orders included in our 688 memberships exceeded their needs. In response, our operation team is actively formulating product strategies and exploring the development of packages that are more suitable for low-frequency direct shippers. In addition, although direct shipper members contributes less revenue from ARPU perspective, their specific characters such as are willing to accept higher freight rates and demonstrate better fulfillment rates provide us with a greater potential for cross-selling with online transaction services and value-added products. So, in the long run, direct shippers will not only serve as the primary catalyst for future freight listing revenue growth but will also present growth opportunities across other segments of our business.OperatorThe next question comes from Jiulu Li with the CICC. Please go ahead.Jiulu Li -- CICC -- Analyst [Foreign language] OK. My first question is about the commission strategies. So, what is the overall commission strategy for 2024? And in particular, what is your plan for commission rate and commission coverage improvements in 2024?Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Jiulu. The substantial increase in our commission revenue in the past quarter was fueled by the rapid growth rate of the platform's overall orders. The number of commission orders rose by 41% year over year and nearly 10% from the third quarter. From an operational level, this quarter, we will continue to prioritize growth in users and order volume rather than just expanding to additional cities under the commission model. By the end of 2023, our commission model had been successfully rolled out in 204 cities. In the meantime, we have also stress test higher commission parameters in randomly selected cities and verified its viability. So, entering into 2024, we will remain -- we will maintain our prudent approach for our transaction service business. In addition, we will continue to enhance the value of our transaction services to users through ongoing product functionality improvements. For instance, we recently launched our [Foreign language] Saving Package 2.0 product for truckers, which includes various privileges and protection features for those who subscribed. And truckers who purchased the Saving Package 2.0 will also receive discounts on future commissions, as well as bonus order points, which they can redeem for additional benefits such as expedited deposit refunds. From a long-term perspective, we believe that our current commission rates are very conservative and that there's still ample room to boost our commission revenues in the future. Looking ahead into 2024, as the platform's network effects strengthens and users' reliance on our platform deepens, we expect that year-over-year commission revenue growth will remain strong and potentially surpassing the growth rate that we achieved in the past year. Jiulu Li -- CICC -- Analyst [Foreign language] My second question is non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased by 50.6% year over year in the fourth quarter, outpacing revenue growth for the same period. What are the main reasons for the high growth in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter? How do you expect sales and marketing expenses to trend in 2024? Thanks.Simon Cai -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. The high growth rate of non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter was primarily due to the increase of investments in marketing to acquire new users, both through online and offline channels, as well as our brand promotion to increase our brand awareness. Online, we mainly advertise through app stores, information streams, and search engine marketing, among other venues. And offline, we primarily acquire users through truck stickers and advertising and our field marketing teams. Moving into the coming year, we will continue to employ a very active user acquisition strategy to grow our user base and optimize our user structure. Our overall user acquisition strategy will continue to attract shippers and truckers to our platform via a combination of online and offline channels, driving [Inaudible] In the longer run, we anticipate a continued increase in sales and marketing expenses, aligned with the expansion of new business ventures. However, as our revenue quickly scale up and especially as we optimize commission penetration and improve -- further improve operating leverage, sales and marketing expenses will gradually decline as a percentage of total net revenues.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session.
